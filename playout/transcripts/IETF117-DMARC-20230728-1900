Here's the agenda for today. We have 2 main topics. One of them is the ongoing discussion of what to say in the document out your responsibilities as a sender when you're using p equals reject. and you what you ought to be doing as a recipient when you get something that's got a policy of p equals rejection. We have a number of options to discuss there. The other is a discussion of a proposal that came up recently about what to do with SPF and whether SPF still I'm getting an echo from Todd, whether SPF is still applicable in D Mark or whether we should get rid of it and what options we have there. I'll just stress that the proposal that was made only about what to do about SPF. in in its use in Demark, no one is suggesting that we deprecate us in general right now. and then we'll just see if there's anything else, if there's time left. We actually asked for a 1 hour slot, and we got an hour and a half slot. will use whatever we need. I suspect we'll need more than the hour a half, so we'll stop there. But before we go on to further things, Murray has a few things to say. So let me switch over to Murray's slides. And that would be that one. So Murray is going to think food here.

About that time, we started talking about creating a working group so that we could produce a standard track version of this because the idea was to get put it put it through the independent submission stream, which can only produce informationals. Once there was a something people could refer to Yahoo took it upon themselves to publish people's reject before we were actually done with it, and you all know what the damage was when that happened. the actual chartering happened in August 2014. And since then, we've public well, 70 49 got published about a year later. And then we've had 5 documents published since then. Like, you can see the timeline of those 5 things here. next to this. wanna highlight these 2. We started talking about creating this working group July 20 It is now July 2023. working group actually chartered just over a year later after quite a bit of about what the expectations the working group would be and what it would produce. Next, please. So it's been 9 years that we've been at this. Next, please. the first thing I wanna talk about is how long we've been doing this. There aren't many working groups that are around 9 years working on its primary problem. Usually, by now, we've had in comparing to other working groups we've had. The primary document out, maybe some auxiliary documents out, still be an update some errata have happened, but this working group is still working on its main deliverable.

There's stuff that we need to be doing if our scope is too small if we've been too tough. We should consider other work. But At the same time, there are a lot of working groups not producing much or not Not they're not they're not meeting their milestones. I think that this is starting to become a very obvious example. The next AD may not be as tolerant of this as the four of us have been. You might get someone in who's just wants to shed work. if this is not gonna work, then this working group is on we'll be on the chopping block. I can't promise that any longevity beyond the end of my term, which is So we start asking questions. Like, should this working group's you be better used in other ways? Email core could use some more energy from email people. maybe extra, maybe jmap.

After 9 years and we have solve the main problems. like like like What are we doing? It's not impossible that there's a solution out there, but we should start asking ourselves some of these questions some of these questions. Do we have the energy to keep searching for for a solution if there is one We have, I would say, venture to say there is a frequent problem distractions and regressions into stuff we've already debated and so forth. So Please be careful about this. next, please. So back to the timeline, let's focus on these last two things. There are 2 experimental documents this working group has produced. Next, please. So we're doing 2 experiments, Mark, PST. What's this getting for us next? So I guess these experiments are running. I've asked a few times like what status? What are we getting out of these experiments? Are is this is this advancing the D Mark cause?

We're taking the more expensive option, and I don't understand. Maybe it's the right thing to do, but there should be some more conversation about this. Next, please. So You those of you who are around then, when this rolled out, the ITTiff was really angry that this happened in because ITF's business is entirely conducted on mailing lists. and and Demark just made a complete mess of everything. Invite you to go back and find a thread that started on 29 2014 just after this happened where we started discussing What's the damage? What should we do about it? Who should be held accountable?"

So in in in the body of the of the disruption it causes versus the benefit. is the balance right? Are we prepared to stand behind that? so that and here's the the last thing I'm gonna say and I this is the most important point. When this working group was chartered, the contract we have with the ISG is we will produce something that makes this situation better. If we advance something that waters down the idea that This should be deployed correctly. And with minimal disruption, there's gonna be fierce response to it. There's that it's gonna have a really hard time getting through, and that's Barry, when you were on the ISG, you even said, you know, I wanna make sure that something comes out that will solve this problem or is a positive step, at least. I have least the same position, and the other area directors are gonna be even less sympathetic, I predict. So I want this working group to give some really serious thought when we're talking about should we put a must there sort of advice do we wanna give? What are the technical solutions? Because I don't think we're gonna get off easy. Happy to take questions, or you can just move on. I'm not changing the deal that we made with the ISG.

I I could have been more aggressive about shutting down repeat discussions. I opted to allow more discussion Maybe that was the wrong choice. So I own that. the other thing is that I I don't Murray was not trying to say that Denark ought to be solving all of these other problems like the the cousin domains and that sort of stuff. What he was saying was given that what Demark does is as limited as it is. we it the answer to the balance between that and the damage causes may be different than if if if it absolutely shut down the ability to fool people into thinking somebody was you, then we might have a different answer to what that balance is we might be willing to accept more damage.

And people blame it and I think it's mistaken, Blaine, perhaps maybe I'm not on Demark. and that that just has to be factored in. The other part and this is, you know, to John's point about infrastructure. So, you know, of course, D Mark is based on authentication techniques, SPF and decim. And these have not stood the test of times. They're have been vulnerabilities pointed out recently for, you know, decon replay as well as FPF upgrade attacks. you know, these, of course, And, of course, these methods, SPF and DTM, have problems with the mailing list. And, of course, It's T Mark that gets a blame. So I don't really think you know, until some of these infrastructure issues are going to be solved, it's going to you know, Demark would just keep on taking the blame, and you'll feel as if the problem doesn't really get solved where I think the effort there needs to be more effort to be placed in email authentication. Yes. There is you know, the geek and working group has been re spun up There's an opportunity there, and then, you know, we should take advantage of that and try to fix a lot of the things that are mistakenly placed on Demark perhaps in in detail. On DKIM, I would say, yes, we up the working group and has gone completely dead. So if people believe there are solutions in there, it would be great to see participation. On the first point, you're right that D Mark takes a lot of the blame, but D Mark is the 1st one that caused bounces at this scale and within the like, SPF dash all started to go away when people saw the damage that it caused. right.

It wasn't even information yet. But I'm not you know, I think other other thoughts. Firstly, Fastmail, we don't on a p equals reject, and I doubt we're going to anytime soon because it is customers that get to decide whether they want that mail or not, and there's way too many false positives if we do that. We do use the information for various things for filtering. I think the concept of demarcissuing small in terms of here's a good way of, like, being pretty sure it's not being tampered with from the original, but what you do with it that's where I think that's the the bigger problems. That's where the people reject comes in. One of the things we do is we look at the stream of mail to each user and for each address, is this all authenticated now from this address? If so, something unauthenticated while that's really suspicious we're gonna do something bad with that. But if get a mix of authenticating and authentic male on unauthenticated mail from this address because they also get lots of stuff via mailers and stuff.

It should all go away. Everyone stopped using this now. I think that's unlikely to happen, unfortunately. I think, therefore, the best solution is some strong text around when you should use Peoples reject and what are your options are for handling that the receiving side as well.

And we have this this came up, I guess, I brought this up in Vienna. at the the Vienna meeting. So that was a bit over a year ago. and we've been talking about it on and off on the list. We now have a couple of concrete proposals. So the options that are currently open, we have well, the one is no change to the previous text that we had. Todd has rolled some of the new text in. just for it to make it easier to discuss it. But we had previous text, and we can go back to that. We can. Of course, as I said, decide we're not gonna do a standards track version because we can't address this problem adequately. I'm with Neil.

So if you actually would change that of saying a bit, we move p equals 3 complete. SAP equals report. So that would mean that will indicate yes. You can still process it. You can still drop can still reject it. if your other filters say that it's bad, But you should definitely send the report back to say that, you know, lose same kind of processing for for the reporting thing that you do with p equals 3. reject, but would give give a more indication that you shouldn't be just reacting the message because it has best to be that. You should be using other other filters, other things. you know, in in addition to that. So let me get a clarification. on that? Are you suggesting renaming people's reject or adding another option. renaming it, meaning that saying that p equals free check is going to be obsolete that you shouldn't be using anything it it it anymore and and so.

The concern is that they will delay adoption of demarcall together, and that may be the case. but if maybe it's a good thing in the current state of the world that demarc adoption does get delayed. if people continue to implement people's reject as if someone says that, I'm bouncing the mail no matter what, or I'm gonna eat it"

The second thing is just on the mening list stuff. really wish that we'd we'd Made sender header, another one you could use. And so main list would just do decongature over the new message, with added sender thing. And then it's up to the mail clients go, well, fails authentication for from, but it passes authentication for sender. Simjas published some policy maybe, and I'm gonna Allow that, but I'm gonna display a clear thing that this was from Barry Lieber via the IETF Mainly. And then you don't need a whole second standard of anything else. But just a thought. Okay. So I I wanna do a little recap and then move on to the next topic.

The other thing that I wanna probe here is does anybody think that what's in the interoperability considerations section is wrong. to do this does anybody have objections to what is in the interoperability consideration? I'm not I don't want you to answer that at the mic now because we need to move on next topic. But If you do, please post something to the mailing list explaining what you'd like to change there. And now let's move on to topic 3. A little bit ago, I guess, during the last mod meeting, Taro posted something to the demarked mailing list suggesting that we stop paying attention to SPF in Demark, in the first place because SPF will always pass whenever D Kim passes. So DKM ought to be enough. And SPF is just a distraction at best and often a a vector for for problems. had quite a bit of discussion on that, most of which involves observations that d Kim isn't always implemented properly. And so d Kim sometimes fails when it shouldn't. And that means that SPF is a backstop for that. And so there's some discussion of that. 1 of the alternative proposals is that we add a tag to the d Mark record that says sender would like you to pay attention to SPF. the sender would like you to pay attention to decam or the senior would like you to pay attention to either one. and Let's have discussion of that. Taro, You start."

We have have a have a our first partner done, meaning 1st 25 years. And we have 30,000 members, and all of the emails are forward. So if you send the email to kevinel@ekay.fi, it gets forwarded to my real email. We never solved we don't offer any, you know, mailboxes. -- SPF is Right. So SPF will always always fail if you have a minus all there. it will it will never but, yes, there is there is actually some people asking, okay. Can and we added, you know, IKE is, you know, IP addresses to SPF records. And we actually make an underscore fspf.ekay.fi that you can include if you want. I don't know what they would put to do, but suffice simple put to do. But so so his beer is always failing. We do also we we do we have our own outbound set server that actually uses t cam to sign all the messages. We have an arc, when every time else comes in video, ARC Signing We actually verify SPF and Decom when they come in. So we actually put in the architecture, and I've I've I've sent an email to the demarcolist showing some of the statistics we have, and we we have actually I was actually really, really surprised how many of, you know, emails actually had a valid, you know, decum signatures when they come in and how many actually already had multiple arcs records. when they come into me to to IKE. IKE actually adds 1 more, but, of course, you know, was actually before our the the added also. it was using actually, adding our if we add a third one, then we know that there's 2 before. So so that that's why I think and and as I said, decomm is usually working fine and at at there's always going to be some cases where somebody does something wrong. There's So I don't think that, okay. Yes. Somebody implements DKAMs wrong somewhere. is not the reason to actually, you know, have an SPF."

So there's always going to be some percentage of know, broken systems, and you never do notice those if you don't actually fail something. So that's why I was thinking, yes, having having that that actually solves much of the issues we have it at at demark is because we don't quantify any of the headers. So decan goes through original centers, Deepgram, goes through I'm sorry. We don't modify them unless we detected to spam, and we add a spam header. The user has asked attempt to add a spam header to this subject. so that then then the d can prevail, but that's actually probably what user wants to have because it's deducted as a spam. But but so that's what the user is chatting anyway. So Yeah. So -- Yeah. Alright. So so that that's why do take is, you know, reason why we actually want to get rid of the SPF in Deep Park. Okay. Thanks. We have five people in the queue, we had 6. Murray dropped himself off. So The queue is closed after Mike, And please speak efficiently because we're down to about 15 minutes loved. Sean in a more John Levine. In a more perfect world, I would agree that getting rid of SPF would be would be a good idea there are way too many Sender is who got a word from the boss saying you have to implement D Mark then they said, what's the cheapest way we can do it? And the answer was with these 2 DNS records, and that's what they do. And many like like, I used to provide mail service for my town government, and they got, like, d mark d markp equals redact messages from the US US Census Bureau. So so I think getting rid of SPF anytime soon is a nonstarter. On the other hand, would be perfectly happy with auth equals decim to tell people, like, we actually do decim so you should use it.

I'm by SBIF we gotta remember as best comes first. process first. And I'm one of those implementers that will reject on negative all And s Deepak would never see Right.

SPF as much as we think it's a good idea to go with decim just because of these SPF upgraded tax. a way to bridge that would be, you know, default support, SPS medium, but then allow the sender to specify using an auth tag which authentication they support, To Neil's point earlier, this might be way specified Right? I mean, basically, you could have a list, a list of what authentication techniques the sender is going to use if specified through there. I would argue I agree that doing SPF and d cam is problematic or at least a problematic support. I mean, you know, a technical level can be done. It's just, like, it probably causes more problems but it would be useful to allow that to specify, like, an or, meaning if if December, it's going to at signed with SPFndygum. that it can that list can support more than 1 so then you can specify, like, and Deepgram if they want to assert that they're using both and perhaps in some circumstances is good idea to know that they have both. scenarios where like, with like, we play. that might be useful to know that they also claim that they're doing SPF. the I think to Hector's point, And that maybe I didn't completely understand what your seeing, but, I mean, having some way of knowing that there might be certain circumstances where the mail from might not be directly aligned with the header from and off being able to authenticate even so because of whatever, you know, enterprise policies it might be useful to specify what is the domain that"

So the What with the SPF and the the government stuff and whatever do you given that, do you think that the text that I put into the interoperability consideration saying that if you use p equals reject, you must decomsign. is do do you think that mitigates any of that? it would have people paid attention to it. Yes. Yeah. No. I mean, Indeed, the the reason I noticed this problem is because I forwarded their mail to Gmail, and, of course, it got lost. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, Once again, it's like it it it is it is a poor implementation what they say does not meet what they say that clearly does not reflect what they we want you to do. Yep. So, yeah, I would say, like, You're Yeah. it mitigates it to the extent that we can tell people to do stuff and they're not gonna pay them. Okay. Oliviate. I did. You can get in it if you want. because you're right. Yeah. My main concern is I will do the might reject the mobiles because, like, I've been working on Demuxys only 1 years for, like, PhD the roofs is going to fight, and that has been quite profitable for a long time. but I've seen a lot of system administrators that does not understand the market at all."

Like, a lot of people think it will phase phase phase is only one will fail. For example, like, a lot of people presenters misunderstand the f o f o tag. And when I talk to system administrator, they think that the f o tags make make give you the choice, like, what we are talking about today. Gotta do auto all the OTH tags. And from the result that I have, for example, like, 35% of the the market owner, that have FFO tags don't have WF. It means that they really don't understand. and especially, like, even in the security conference such as, like, UsNix, there is a paper that states wrongly how the Demac check mechanism mechanism works. I think, like, if you change and if the ITT have changed some specifications, people will get lost because A lot of people, they don't read erosive the the the erosive Most of them, they go on to blog post on even, like, source party services. website that educate them and that told them how it works. I think we should also, like, go more in the directions like like, how Tipple. feels about the market and also how Sorry. Man, also, like, thinking about like, those people that have equal non and non are you and non AeroF. for example, like, 40% from the measurements that I have. 40%. of the Demagricle does not have any p equal reject ground time, or you're you're you're guess. It means that 60% of Demak records that my opinion is is take place.

When you read it, it's crystal clear. The plan is, like, we are few people in the world that really reads services. Usually, system and administrators to just they're gonna read ERCs. If they read it, or they just they're gonna read websites of such as support services So in my opinion, it's crystal clear when you know it and when you read it well. but it's kind of aided to go to this It's clear, but people don't read what we write.

In other words, they just see I've got a knob or a dial or check boxes to select what I want. so they don't necessarily read the RFC.
