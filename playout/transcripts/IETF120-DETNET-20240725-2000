I would like to remind everybody that about the IETF note well Everybody is expected to be familiar with these rules and policies under which we conduct our business and if you are not if you don't accept these rules and policies, then you should not participate if I would like to also remind you that all of the contributions, become part of our permanent record Also, we have the conduct dial guidelines and please act accordingly and as for participation like the logistics I would like to remind in for participation, like the logistics, I would like to remind the in-person participants to scan the QR code you see on the screen as well for the blue sheet. And of course participating remote you get your part participation get recorded automatically yes you have found your way here so no need to repeat most of these slides have been presented on our first session on Tuesday and this is the second session Thursday So we will be not repeating everything There is one change in the agenda for this session There is a new item being added"

With that, I suggest to go to the first presentation which is on site in person, and you can control the slides with the remote control control Okay, sure, thank you. So testing, that's work. Thank you uh here this is the first session of the lunch So I will just try to cheer up everyone by using this presentation Good afternoon, everyone. This is the second presentation about our draft It's a flow aggregation for enhanced data net Myself, Kenji from CEMCC, and the trans from VTE. I think she's online right now and Genu from San Yan from South Korea Korea So this agenda of the today's presentation This is the second time right? So I have put some we have put some recapture slides about about the back part. So basically, this is some work, it's like a derived from what a trend. She has done a great presentation in IETF 119 covering like scenarios, gaps, requirements for the flow aggregation for a large scale"

Now it's the draft 01. So there are two so far there are two major sections on this part One is objectives, requirements and general print principles. That is the most basic on the work from the previous, although we did have a revision or changes And then also, you know, for the feedback and the comments we collected, from the previous IETF, there are questions asking, okay, so you have some good points or aspect but we all know flow aggregation is some sort of mass for enhanced data. So, you know, can you justify something? So basically nothing, so we say, okay, well, let's do, this is not just like a way, like realization for flow aggregation for 5GS, then that is not like a come from the way I'm going along the slide I'm going to explain why this one comes up. Okay, so this is agenda So I have 15 minutes. You can Okay, sure. Thank you. So, uh, face the assignment we have comments and feedback So this is our source and the release logics. You know, I have already explained. But here, there are three major bullets. That is the foundation of the individual drafts at this moment But this time, we made some change. So for the first part, we laid out some general objectives and requirements for the flow action of the enhanced data net. This is the first step of the thinking logic. And then based on that,"

And then because of this, like the general objectives requirements, principles, and it's okay okay, how about apply this type of general things, a common, accepted things to some real scenario? Okay, so we pick up the 5GS. So by applying the process principles to 5GS, we believe this can help prove the merits and effectiveness, effectiveness of the proposal in the draft. So this is the thinking logic and also the revision logic of the current version Here just to show the difference. He can see a the original section three and 4 have been marked to be the new section 2 This is for the objective requirements with some principles in band-day. And also, we provide a completely new section for the reality of this one for 5GS Dan NAC service. I'm going to use a slide later to show what is the 5Gs DanNet service Okay, this just gave our Ingman a deep comparison Okay, so actually, you know, the things like all the details are in the current version of the draft So we let's summarize, well, this is this is, this points are based on most of them are based on the work not"

And also the aggregation like implications of flow aggregation to trendnet nodes here we just give all the details that all the details are in the draft but here all the bullets in the bold farm, I believe they are pretty self-explanatory and then you know can see we can go to the next one. Okay, so this is the gen self-explanatory and then you know can see we can go to the next one okay so this is the general the general objectives requirements and the general principles we have proposed okay so this is the things I you know that actually inspired us, okay, because from IETF 19, 119, people ask, okay, what can you do? with it? You know, it's good, flow aggregation is good. Okay for large scale, then. So for ITL work you know, let me get it. So what can be done? so what is the usefulness or merit of your work? Okay, so actually, this is a new, there's a plenary meeting from three GPP last month. I think in Shanghai. You know, for each plenary meeting in S in 3GPP, there will be a IETS sorry, there will be when IETF status report to 3GPP, that will be presented by the IETF leadership 3GPP, there will be an IETS, sorry, there will be when IETF status report to 3GPP.

So we look at this one actually got inspired. Oh yeah realization of the IETF and S in our slides for 5G using IETF technologies So the similar things. So the liaison has been sent out from IETF to 3GPP to ask for some feedback for verification of correct for comments, for consent for clarification, for all the things. So it's like, okay, IETF has done some great work. And now to send some reference, I'm not guidance yet, reference to 3GPP before IETF part, but you're published. So it's like in action between, among different SDOs standard development organizations So we got inspired, okay, so the similar things. So we have some good like a general objectives requirements principles okay, how can we do something similar?

So basically it's like transparent box and then from the left side like your UE, you're just like your mobile phone or some other phone with 3GPP standard, 3GP access. So from the left side, it can connect to other data net system and to the right side is also can be connected to some other data system So consider all things together it's like holistic in large-scale data system so here so i just give for area information. So you have a picture 5GS, it's like logical Danak trend Okay, now, we have the objectives we have requirements, we have general principles and then we got inspired. Think, believe, I IETF, that has some good work. Okay, from the analogy is now slicing. Here, the similar things for flow aggregation for that net. So how about apply? the same things to do a realization of flow aggregation? for 5GS data? So also for bullets in both bonds are corresponding to the one I have just explained or presented for the general things. The first one is a realization of five across domain, and the second one is like the QS provisioning, aggregating, and fine green Actually, this will be well, structured across the 5GS itself not a big box, but from inside it's very structured.

So, okay, how about to do some sort of realization for the 5GS things, 5GS? has defined that then has a logical node Okay, so when we put this one together, you know, we revised our previous one, also based on some feedback from one Okay, so when we put this one together, you know, we revised our previous one, also based on some feedback from 119, say, okay, how usefulness, who can read it? who will benefit, who will benefit, who, you know, when you get this work down, or where are going to send it? So this is the thinking logic and revision logics of the whole new draft Okay, here this is the next step. I'm not going to repeat the first and the second bullet The last one is not so okay. I have, well, we want to end enforce that we're not asking for adoption right now We're just asking for feedback. Is this some useful way? along the time for the group to come? So that is the thing, you know, with are looking at right now. And remember he time for the group to consider? So that is the thing, you know, we are looking at right now. And remember here, this is also the basic of the feedback we collect from IABF 190. So okay I think I'm going to start here Ah, tolex Eckert, thank you Without me having all the 5G background, it quite difficult for me to figure out what kind of the beef at the end in terms of what deadnet would have to do over all the pieces we've already"

So don't give me the answer now, right, but I think kind of that type of strip down to the ultimate outcome for us would be very helpful. And I think then people may be more motivated trying to understand all the 5G stuff right so that because that that is a lot of stuff that I agree right if we see there is a chance for not too much work to get some some feedback out of that that may be attractive to people can I have one more point but if you Actually, I'd be very interested in hearing the answer from the speech on that point that you just raised. If we- Can I have one more point, but if you... Actually, I'd be very interested in hearing the answer from the speaker on that point that you just raised. Oh, I was hearing it's too long, but sure, yeah, please. We have some time because we are lightly loaded this session so I'd love to hear from that. But if you want to ask your second question first so well my main concern is still that the key part of aggregation, which I think we need for really the large scale dead nets, which maybe even 5G when they were thinking about, just, you know, sell local type of IOT use cases, right, then, which they may not be considering about is the flow interleaving, right? Remember the draft, I did have updated it this time, but the point is really, I see from, you know, wider scale IOT remote control applications just you know, a humongous number of flows with you know, very far apart bursts, right? So something like devices sending a message every one to 10 milliseconds. And if you have tens of thousands of those and you don't have them coordinated in an interleaved way, then you're simply adding up these bursts and you're wasting humongous amount of bandwidth in the network right so that's why I think aggregation without interleaving is a far too short-going step and that maybe you know feedback. We also want to provide to three GPP and 5G that there really need to look into that"

But yeah, so that's my main concern for the large scale that we're looking into. Okay, for the first question about the 5GS part, you know, this is a picture You know, if you consider this one as like black box the 5GS is just a trend-end node node. Although within the box is so complicated actually. And then this is like, no, uh, one 5Gs, system, it's a component architecture it might be comprised of multiple data net nodes within. Okay, it's just a depends how 5Gs is being structured here. Well, actually, the depends on the number, well, the things is different on the number of the user plan functions User plan function is It's no point, right? Point yeah, this is a user per function. So basically it depends on the number of UPFs, not being a used in the 5GS. So the whole thing here is like if you consider the 5GS logical data node, okay it's like rather, it's basically just like rather on the on the left side, on the left side, it's like a your UE, okay, or you are a mobile equipment with 3GP access, the same thing well, for your second question, like IOT. For the IOT, part, actually, is being discussed a lot about how that one is not on the dead net perspective yet, but there are a lot of things how the IOT or ambit iot most likely ambient iot is like no power source things, kind of things, how that can be accommodated in the 5G system okay on the right hand side as I mentioned, the UPF, UPF, just so you can, oh yeah, it's probably, just like router, it can do the routing functionalities So toward the right side, it connected"

So toward the right side, it connected to some other than that nodes or other than that network, like a self-domain. So if you put ads into or other than that network, like a self-domain. So if you put out of the thing together, you get this one, this one, and this is this like a big, holistic domain Yeah, this work for the 5GF of the logical then-hacks trend node. It has been standard standardized, okay, but the end of last May, has been done. This is in the spec already. Actually, I'm not sure you still remember there was some liaison between the 3GP band here. Talk about all the parameters or something whether IETF can provide such that 3GP can do the work better but the liaison actually make 3GP go some other way, things IETF does not have such type of tool So 3GP will do their own extension at this moment So can I jump in there with a point? So I mean, this would ultimately be similar to you know, using TSN technologies for deadnet subnets, how do we call it, right? So some TSN and TSN hops and then we need to look into those underlying technologies, particular guarantee behavior, especially for the latency right? And while it was interesting to see that they've been in in three GPP looking also into stateless weighted for queuing, I think, you know, some of the proposals that we've been dealing with on our queue side will provide a much better, you know, property for scalable bounded latency And that may need to go into those 5G things even if we would like them to be a black box, they need to be a blockback blocks that works for large-scale net services right so that's that's one of the challenges actually or I can do we have time Yeah, okay.

Maybe I forget the TSC, TSS, actually, it's like the one, the TSN you are mentioning right here And then for what hour, like you are queuing No, I'm talking about the user plane, right? So you need to point to the UE's and the queuing and the traffic model at that level. I was going to explain to you. The thing, this is a black box. You know, you cannot from outside. You can only go through this way to provide all the parameter setting your requirements to this one and then choose some policy function called the PCF. That is going to help the five to set a QS requirement for QS for QS flow So for whatever you have asked outside, this one in the IETF domain the CPF data controller is going to do the mapping and send through the TS have asked outside, this one in the IETF domain, the CPF data controller is going to do the mapping and send through the TSCTS function to the 5GS I understand that what I'm saying is if the 5G technologies are not going to provide in the user plane good scalable and efficient per hop bounded latency algorithms like we've been looking into, then these are just not going to be good subnets for a large-scale deck net system, right? yes, of course we can use these things like we can use any other subnets, but I would hope that when they're trying to do something that actually you know um scales to the order that they hope they get and which we're hoping to get with that net, then I'd be worried about that they haven't done enough of of homework for that. Okay, well, I can answer that question regarding the Lateton boundary for the 5GS Actually, this, this the things, that has been earlier than exchanged between the 3GP and IABF. Basically, from the 3GPV set is asking, can the IABF domain stand that's latency boundary to us?"

If they're doing the interleaving which I haven't seen on their plan, they can be efficient right? If you use stateless stuff, you may not need that much aggregation so and so there are many more technical details than just saying, oh, we just sent an SLA and magically everything works. I understand that we're sending SLA to them. Yeah, as I mentioned, you're talking, we are talking about aggregation and you're talking about aggregation. He and magically everything works. I understand that we're sending SLA to them. Yeah, as I mentioned, we are talking about aggregation and you are talking about aggregation.

It is there enhancement for award and new work we think we should do in internet So from results, management, we should provide finding those scheduling and scheduling as management to meet the bandy latency requirements We should provide the rational utilization of resources and the improvement of lateral performance.

Yeah, I think for the current version of the controller, plane framework, there is a low enhancement for the enhanced net or the sprayback example, the processing of in control play of the Q queuing solutions and there is no extensions for some queuing solutions, there is no extensions for something like that in the existing control play framework but this is just part of the document We also would like to propose to the whole trafficking engineering free work, including the data and the control plane including their ongoing work and the references we should do worldwide about that to deliver It has done that Well, traffic engineering is certainly in scope of the current controller plane document If you're reading it and don't think it is, it might be helpful to send comments to the list on how you'd like to see that document change so that it is clear, because that's certainly in scope And you're talking also the aggregation and using maybe class-based aggregation And if you'd like, if you think we would like to see that"

So think about how you want to change that document and send the comment to the list, and that would be really helpful to us And one other area that you mentioned is the inter-domain piece, and there has been an attempt to bring an inter-domain into that document So again, if you don't think it's adequately covered, your feedback and helping get that document to completion would be really appreciated Okay, I will send my phone Just an add-on to that, that keep in mind that that is a framework document and details to be developed by other documents if we need to make announcements to protocols whatsoever Yeah, thank you. So I will send home to the existing document of the main list. Thanks Yeah, and if for some reason you don't get to it before we start the last call, those would be reasonable last call comments as well It's not too late to fix the document or to change it. Okay, with that I think we're in the bottom unless you have anything else, we're going to move on Thank you very much and I'm forgetting the last speaker's name Julian. Oh, sorry. Or the on So please go ahead Okay, thank you, chairs It's JAU from DTE Let's talk about NPRSD network action for determinates the latency"

Okay, okay Whatever the problem was, it seems to be good, so please pick up, maybe backup just a little bit and start again okay thank you Okay um um to resolve the requirements that not scaling requirements introduced in the data scaling requirements draft and this draft provides an MPSMNA solution to resolve the dynamic scale issue and um you know, this draft, is to support the deterministic latency so we have defined this term terminology and based on the comments from Agent Farial, the terminology definition, the original terminology definition seems not very accurate so make some objects to eight and the definition of the deterministic latency should be an ability"

And for the flow aggregation, actually, it has been supported via MPR label And for the functions, you know, to ensure the deterministic latency, it may be involve QI method and delay data information So, we design them"

There's some considerations about it first to ensure the end-to-enlate latency guarantee. It's very important to select the right Qing method you know, for the different application or use cases, we may use different QI Q&MISR, so for this parameter, we think is for carry in the data plane. And the second one is by about the network delay, actually it's related to network topology skill and network flow skill so to address the large skill requirements the hop counts for delay assessment is another important factor And for the delay information, which information be carried, we use a timestamp For timestamp can be easily extra extracted and aid can provide you know a solution to independent"

The first issue is about the necessary for this work As we know, the requirements for scaling are determined networks, it introduced in this WG draft and to provide an enhanced data plan solution to address the scale requirements are in the scope of dinnet charter So from my perspective, for this issue, the answer is absolutely yes And for the second issue, it's an A solution is in the right way in your face the second issue is whether NPRMNA solution is in the right way. We need your feedback for this question question And for the traditional data function, but it is that, you know the right way. We need your feedback for this question. And for the tradition of that function, you know, that NPR's definitely solution has specified in fc in this NFC and this for it from DINATPRI functionality as through, you know, as label and control words and flow action flow aggregation, you know, wire MPSA label But there are the beginning requirements actually, it not be addressed in that structure And MPRs WG provides"

If the answer to the issue 2 is yes, then we can go to the issue 3, so we would like to know whether the design for the accelerator data you know, whether the parameters are you to know whether the design for the cellular data, you know, whether the parameters are enough or your comments about it And other feedback and suggest are welcome. Okay, thank you This was presented in Monday's MPLS meeting, correct? Can you summarize what you see happened there? you see happened there? I think there are some comments about, you know, several questions or why it's about whether the dinnet use case is about, you know, several questions or one is about whether the dinnet use case, it's in the Amtas M use phase several questions or why it's about whether the dinnet use case, it's in the Amtrak Amnese space.

Thank you, Francisco sisters So this was presented in Empire Working Group. I think some comments were that are we addressing the right debt net requirement Is this socialized with the debt networking group? Are we solving the right? problem? Is this the right way to solve it? and whatnot? So get feedback from the debt networking group and see if they are okay with this kind of solution. OK Okay. So, you know, I think we're talking about the MPLS data plane so mpLS working group gets to say what is the right thing for them or what is the right way to solve? the problem i think it's on our group to talk about what are the requirements and make sure that it's hitting the right requirement requirement It would be easier to have two separate documents or do joint adoption separating requirements from solution, because that then allows us to do things separately, you know, cleanly but more documents is always a good thing so I think it would be good to talk with the working group chairs there to see where is they think the solution is to us it feels a little early, I think because I think we're still sorting through what our requirements are when we're talking about the post the solution is.
