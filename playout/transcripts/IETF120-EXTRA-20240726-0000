So we just stay in the one room the whole time Separate, that's still correct Yeah, it'll do separate notes. It'll do separate notes have anything to say, it'll still be nice if you log in to the onsite tool, just so that we get the numbers to prove that there will more than two people here. So please do pop out your phone and scan that QR code Here links, here's the links to the agenda, Meetecho information and everything else. You probably should have seen these well before this session most likely OK, our agenda for today we've just gone through the, all the ministribia Extra is going to be very short, about five minutes Mail main is going to take up the bulk of this hour The extra agenda is just reviewing four documents here Talk about the future of Extra and as I said previously, the bulk of this is going to be on the mailmaid stuff We've got three documents for proposed work items We have a charter discussion which will be led by Murray And then we'll get to any other business if we have time Anyone want to bash the agenda before we get started? Hearing none All right, should we hit the extra? agenda then? Yes. We should be able to get through it fairly quickly. There are a couple of things that came up since we put this together.

Okay, all right Thanks may already know the answer to this question, but I'm going to ask for my own education Murray does this group have to stay open until all these things pass into the editor queue, or how does that work? There's no hard and fast rule. I tend to leave the working group open in case some these things pass into the editor queue or how does that work? There's no hard and fast rule. I tend to leave the working group open in case something comes up and off 48 that needs a consensus verification If the working group is really eager to close, then I can kill it because I don't where to find you all But I would prefer to leave it open just like I had my pattern. Okay. So it'll stay open, but no more work will come into this working group. Extra Okay. And when it gets to the point where we're actually totally done, I will contact the chairs and say, do you want to leave the list open or should we close it?

If you have a lot of people don't know their own email addresses and it is really easy to get mail like this one, which, this is an actual message that my co-offer got intended for, you know, it's, it's, full it's full of PII it's it's not spam but it's not for him, and there's no way for him to tell the sender that it was sent to the wrong place And I have a Gmail address, which is my name. And there are probably about 100 people in North America with the same name I have, and they all think that that's their email address So I get the damnedest stuff. So this is a real problem that I hope we can agree Next please So what will we do? And the end answer is we want some sort of button to in the user interfaces analogous to the spam button, but it's a not me button And it's not, you know, and it's different from the spam button, because it's not, spam. You don't want to punish the sender. You want to tell the sender that they're sending stuff to the wrong place. And as it says here, the buttons at the bottom, yeah, but it has a wrong because it's not spam. You don't want to punish the sender. You want to tell the sender that they're sending stuff to the wrong place. And as it says here, the buttons at the bottom, it has a variety of benefits. First, it gets against the junk out of your mailbox It minimizes the liability for like, you know, I get, you know, I get mail for a, for a physician in Massachusetts discussing the, discussing these, his, uh, psychiatric hospital shift you know, and I really don't want to know about that you know so this yeah it's a real problem and and that they're suitably motivated, they might even find the right recipient. Next, please so yeah so here's all the stuff that the sender could do you know they could, they could do all this, like if you need somebody, find somebody's email it address. There's all this other stuff you can do"

    "text": "And I think I should have said so on the previous one. This is not intended for personal mail. I mean, I occasionally get mail from someone who thinks I am his brother you know, for him I just write back and I say you got the wrong guy. This is intent for transactional mail that's coming from an institution that doesn't have a way to, you know, it's simply from don't reply at big company. Next So what we did was there was already a widely used one click unsubscribe feature There's the list unsubscribe header as you can have a URL. You add there's a list unsubscribe one-click header that says that it works for on-click and what you do is you simply is work add there's a list unsubscribe one click header that says that it works for on click and what you do is you simply is whereas the regular unsubscribe is a get, you simply do a post to the to the to the unsubscribe with a with a well-defined string to make it clear the a get, you simply do a post to the to the unsubscribe with a well-defined string to make it clear. This is a one click unsubscribe. So this will be exactly the same thing you know it would be a different URL it would be a different message and when this came up before, somebody pointed out that people read their mail off offline, so what do you do if it's offline? And the answer is the same thing you do if you report to a message offline. If you can cue a reply to send by email you can queue and not me. Or for that matter, you can cue a spam. You're going to do the post when the MUA is the MUA is back online because these posts are intended not to be interactive. They send the post you get the answer back. There's no notification to the user, so it's perfectly possible to do it, to do it, to cue it and do it offline And RFC 8058 has been wildly successful on a couple of large mail providers insist that anybody sending bulk mail must provide them if they're sending more than, I think, 5,000 a day. So the, so the, uh, click on subscribe definitely works and is definitely widely used Next So here's the recipient Here's the proposal. Like the header might be wrong recipient the here's the here's a proposal like the header might be wrong recipient and it's got a URL with a hash token identifying the message in the recipient and you do this post to the URL with a wrong recipient equals true to make it clear that"

So this is a short draft next please. So yeah, so, I mean, I hope mailmate will adopt it. I have talked to, say, senders at MOG who say they are interested in this, so I think that finding evidence that people will adopt, finding evidence that people will implement this should not be hard. I think that's the last slide. Yep Yes Any comments or feedback? I would say, you know, but I don't best ahead, Neil's in. Go ahead, Neil Not a lot of comments other than say that sounds like a sensible idea and the one-click stuff I agree was good, so making this as similar as possible. It's perfect sense to me. That's it Neil, question for you. Would you implement? this in our client? Yes, I think so. You have to think about how, but yes Okay, Pete Pete, as to adopt how, but yes. Okay, Pete. pete resnick. As to adoption, I think it's perfectly reasonable, especially if we've got the sound of people who are looking to implement this Let's confirm that, but that sounds good On the mechanism itself, I'm wondering if an email-based mechanism given that this thing has a hash to identify the message in question, that's going to go back to the original folks, is something along the line? of an MDN even applaud in question that's going to go back to the original folks, is something along the lines of an MDN, even a plausible thing, or will people simply not implement a mechanism like that? because you could give it as an alternative especially for offline clients, you send a message"

It would still be an action of the same button, but it might use email instead of the post And yes, well, I have two answers The first answer is that, sure, you could do that i mean the the other answer though is that we've had the one click unsubscribe for for years and nobody has ever complained that doing it offline was hard And unsubscribe seems just slightly different to me only because it is a mailing list, and you can sort of identify that you want to go to that unsubscribe page and it does end up with some kind of action I believe. No, no, no, no, no, no the unclick one subscribe is typically, it's typically done. It's a silent post. It's a, it's done as a side effect of reporting it to spam. Gotcha. Yeah no, no. The regular unsubscribe is to get Right. The one-click unsubscribe is specifically to designed to be non-interactive. There's no interaction with the user There's no way to try to bargain with them and say, you're sure you want on unsubscribe, like damn right, I do. Right. Okay, so, yes deliberately, you know, we know, basically given a lot of experience that this, this non-interactive unsubscribe posts works. And we figured we can do the same thing so that my guess is if we asked Neil, would you use the same code? He probably would say yes and and I'll say again I got no problem with this going forward as is if folks on both ends think that having a mail mechanism in addition to this is useful great if not it's not something that I I... We can bike show the mechanism once we adopt the mechanism. Exactly. Thank you Okay. Okay, John John Okay, John. My concerns are identical to Pete's so I probably don't need to repeat them and won't.

But that's a detail we can hash out once we get the thing adopted I'm just going to stay here. I have seen discussion of doing more than just wrong recipient to all have a, I never asked for this basically the thing that you get with social media where you can say report this post, this is sexually sexual just wrong recipient to also have a, I never asked for this, basically the thing that you get with social media where you can say report this post, this is sexually explicit material, this is a, scam, this is a race of different things. Do we want a more general mechanism rather than adding an ad hoc one? for every single thing? Because certainly this is one case of, I got the wrong message here but there are also other cases of being able to be report back why you don't like what the problem with this message is um Again, you could certainly do that. I think this is one of those humans this is one of those human factors things that the sender is dying to know exactly what the recipient thinks The recipient just wants her to buzz off and is not interested in providing a lot of extradition So again, if there were some evidence that you, recipients would actually have some interest in using a mechanism, like that, sure, we could build it. But I wouldn't want to build it without some evidence that was useful. Hmm. All right if there were some evidence that recipients would actually have some interest in using a mechanism like that, sure we could build it. But I wouldn't want to build it without some evidence that was useful. Certainly, if you're on Facebook, for example, and you say report this post, it's says, why do you want to report it? And that mechanism has evolved and been used by a lot of people in that context. The question is really does it apply in this context? or not?

So if we could leave the remaining comments to whether you think it's a good idea or bad idea and leave the design I once decide, that'd be great I support the idea okay aren't I like the idea, but I have a question about using it for personal mail. Why is that? a bad idea or inappropriate? to me it seems that something like that post might go straight into the address book If you say fast mail like everyone does, then fast mail might provide that on the outgoing mail. And if someone's, says i'm the wrong recipient it just shows up in the senders address book. Why? is this off limit for now? now? This is typically for mail sent from a bulk sender that doesn't you mean... Right. But why do you want to limit it to that?

I have the I ask problem john levine does, but one, Jim, jim fenton, support this. I have the same problem john levine does, and I'm glad you've checked with the senders to make sure that they support this. I'm also concerned to make sure, and we need to make sure that people that are implementing MUA, will support this as well so that you know, the wrong recipient button will appear Yeah, I mean, the sad fact is the largest MUAs are webmills and they'll do it Lyndon.

That's all Well, that seems like the exact opposite of what I was hearing the last time my sponsors this could either murray or john levine brief outline what the objections were? the last time? Expires. The first one bullet you have here 2156 to find that an I-1088 translate ex-portedomeo Yeah. It says something like it stops being applicable or relevant or something, you know, pretty, kind of a dictionary definition and and and then 850 defined it for use net which didn't add was no better and there hasn't been a more solid definition than that since. So when this case, up under sponsorship the complaint was what do i do if that date is in the past what is a what is an what is an what is an mua do what is an mta do and there was no consensus on that point. That's where it's stalled. So if we're okay with never reaching consensus on that point, then the AS, I think, is a great path forward. But if this is going to come up and last call, like what the hell does this actually mean, then we haven't accomplished it anything. So I just like, are we okay with that being the path?

But again, I then the MUAs don't have to do anything if you want to set a policy for a mailbox or policy for a set of mailboxes.

But that can be handled at adoption, maybe kind of clarifying language but I'm fine with moving forward Daniel Yeah, Daniel, Daniel, I here don't, I think one of the problems with this is that it's similar to the sender saying this is an important email in that the sender can't decide when something is important or not, whether or something is important to me. And the same this has a similar smell where maybe I'm a kind of person who likes to keep emails around about what was for long for the last year because I really love that and the sender telling me that that email should go away or something just feels very weird. I don't think it I don't think this is some really love that and the sender telling me that that email should go away or something just feels very weird. I don't think it I don't think this is something that a male user agent can act upon in any meaningful way because what you as a sender decide expires means might be very different from what another sender. Another sender means, I think expired means, and I as a recipient, think about it completely different way, so it's sort of a weird piece of"

Do I just strike it through and color it red, or do I put it right to the trash? In this case, you could see I'll just remove anything that comes with expires or I want to keep it.

John and Lyndon, if you could be quick everything i was going to say i said already said the chat I was just going to say, to address the ambiguity, maybe we could look at adding into the structured body if they had her an intent tag that the person who puts expires in can say, I want this to expire off the desk or, you know, to define it in that way.

Next This is not supposed to be a change of the syntax I'm only proposing to make a repertoire for provisioning and validating human addresses, not to change what something like Zendesk can do or what the pearl maintainer invented for his email address You can still do whatever you want but if you want some assurance that a login field on a WordPress site will accept your email address, then this is what I want the repertoire to be Next I also want to unify the two syntaxes"

It's not an I can't process in this draft not only he's not going to fix it but like it to make it worse, because it takes us down the notorious path we've been down with IDNs of ending up with two or three or four, two or three or more competing standards in terms of what the user see Second observation is that part of this, which goes to the extreme over over-permissiveness of the of the SMTP UTF-8 standards is a real problem and my referring to it is extreme over-permissiveness tells you what I think about the problem but that problem ought to be addressed by updating 6530 or 6531 or 6532 or all three up them and not creating a be"

So, um, we adopt this, I'd like to adopt the question of doing revision to the basis the basis of PUT of A specs along with it There are other parts of this which is a standalone document, I think it'll be fun and advice I think will be fine I'm also very concerned about moving this forward on the basis of asking all the country we know of, which have attempted to do some of this stuff here. Their scripts, because there's going to be a lot of countries turn out on that list, even if they're only intending, only because they intend to do it tomorrow rather than having done it already John, quick question. If we were going to update 6350 through 52, would you think that would be appropriate work for this group? Or would you want to separate working group for that? I don't think you can hear the sigh We just had a little. We did not That's a discussion I think I want to have with Murray Okay, fair enough You know, it depends on how far into various, very complicated issues you want to take this group And I would suggest that even trying to process this draft, which is what's giving me small anxieties, would take you into most of those issues What do we address the basics? effects or not.

The alternative is the status quo and the status quo is people are starting to do stuff like this badly, right? Pretty much. Yeah, pretty much So by not documenting something, we're not not making things better. So I do think there is some urgency on solving this problem somehow I would simply agree with that The difficulty, again, is that from my point of view part of the difficulty we're running into here is that the EIA working group decided it didn't have a long enough poll to feed or otherwise to touch this problem and therefore punt it and that's turning out the bad consequences Daniel?

I was just going to say that I'm happy that there will be next steps I will send an email to Murray, Art, and john klensin and start the discussion Yeah. Thanks you're out boss, man. Yeah next slide, please so you may have seen post-charging there were some concerns about a couple of causes that appear in our charter, and I've highlighted the two of them here. This is the same section that contains the two problems and those are the purported problems The first is that before we'll take anything in this working group for this intended for the standards track, we want to hear a commitment to implement from at least two sources, two independent parties that are intending to do that. And the contention is that this is too high a bar for just merely a document a document Now this clear, just got through the process just fine. There was ample review, so there's another that we need to change immediately, but I wanted to bring it back to here and say, are we still comfortable with this constraint? Now, some of the counter arguments have been well, the routing area does this for everything anyway Ideally, everything that exits the standards track has this, has met this bar But the counter argument is that we have now exits the standards track has met this bar. But the counter argument is that we have never done this in the IETF. There's never been any kind of restriction on"

I'm not taking a humming or anything, but I saw a thumbs that there Is this something we should worry about? Ken. Speaking as myself the IETF mantra has always been rough concern of running code. And I would like to see us get back to that and possibly even bring in the hackathon to make sure we're putting stuff out there that works the first time and not just putting stuff out there that nobody's going to use Thanks. Barry. This is Barry What Ken said. And this isn't the first time it's been done in the IETF It's probably the first time it's been in a charter And, you know, you could argue that, but certainly working groups have chosen to record that less formally in the past so I think it's perfectly fine right One of the arguments, by the way, is what the I forgot that I had another slide. I think you can can't... Companies that have roadmaps might not want to review that they intend to implement something. So this can be a concern as well. Alexity Oh, I'm sorry Gartz in the queue first Then I might be honest to the question.

At adoption time not so much Well, one of the suggestions was to loosen the adoption construction is say intent to implement so if you get two people who are two different parties who say, yeah, we'll try to do this, or we intend to do this, even if they don't do it later that's enough to at least get it into the working group. Right was one of the compromises that was proposed. How would you? feel about that? I feel that it's a good thing to stop working on documents that people don't implement and any kind of phrasing that has a little bit of gray area is good enough to try. If it turns out to be a bad idea, we can change it later. Okay. Thank you Alexi Yeah, I don't think that requiring intent for two implementations to do this Obviously, you cannot have existing implementation because the spec is not finished, right? I don't think it's a very high bar. It's basically prevaced us wasting time. So if the author cannot convince at least one other person, or, you know, if not being implemented to other parties to implement that, that's all already a sign in itself that it's not going to work out out as far as companies not willing to admit public"

Yeah, exactly, but I think it's acceptable Sorry to interrupt, in the case of what aren't just mentioned if a participant of the working group has knowledge but is not willing to disclose can they just tell the chair I know of some people? but I can't tell who they are and obviously there's a trust relationship that it's not BS.

In a sense of, in many cases, chair chairs or chair will probably trust the person reporting this at the same time if you want some kind of external validation may you ask people can you at least tell the chair, email the chair saying, you know, this is okay and this is, this message is not going to be published on the mailing list, but at least the chair knows Right.
