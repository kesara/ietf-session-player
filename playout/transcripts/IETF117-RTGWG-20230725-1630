So here about the contributing consideration. So the control plane need to consider how could we create such a topology. How do we delete that. Right? So when you receive some request from the host. You should be able to calculate that and to see whether based on existing resources, you are able to perform this operation. And if so, how do you define this this topology once you digital calculation, you need to actually configure the network accordingly. And last but not least, when this has been down, then it has to be deleted. So all this should happen according to us in the control plane itself. The quadrupling should also have the capability of doing the resource reservation. Not only reserve the network resource, but also the computing resources. it will also do the performance monitoring because if something failed, as I mentioned, there should have some mechanism of the service protection.

It's not very useful to have some Very nice short pass with not enough bandwidth. It's better to have maybe something a bit longer, but with more in capacity. And to achieve that capacity, we are using a number of tricks. at least in data center networks. Usually, we export symmetry. So we pretend that all the parts as a same and we can can regroup them.

Many interesting basically, anything beyond multistage claw is less symmetric, and a lot of capacity is a lot of nonlinear parts we have to deal with them.

One of the problem that probably the the the the the the mechanism that you're introducing is forgetting that the satellites actually move against each other, especially around the seam and especially when you go to constellations like Walker Delta with the 5th link this notion of themes is everywhere. So any type of configuration of of areas and levels and things like that will will break the the the mechanism of the traditional OISIS or or OSDF configurations. result in root failure. So as as it's it's not a simple manhattan grid. it's it's a consolation that actually will with whole bunch of nodes moving against each other. As long as you stay within one plane, your probably scheme will work. But as long as we are going to do interseam type of greeting, this system of of configuring or dynamically configuring the the the the areas and levels will will will will break. So you might wanna consider that. The other app the other comment that I want you have is that a a sort from inter satellite duting the optimum goal of the satellites or to to root to the ground. So some sort of adversary has to be has to be managed in terms of what satellite for example, at at any given point in time, is covering what type of nodes on the on the ground. and take that into consideration when the near routing.

Service routing as it's done today, you can see on the right hand side, Usually, explicitly resolves the service name at food.com or anything similar. onto network locator. You use an interaction infrastructure to do that. The client issues the request first, and you then utilize the results in order to talk in the actual application level request to the IP address. So very schematically, outlined on the right hand side. example technologies that we're looking at in the in the Gavin of this draft are things like, traditional DNS and whether it's a particular improvements in 1 or 2 load balancing in CDNs.

And the We describe a number of use cases in the draft that that you're free to read. I think in the end, we grew to 11, if I counted correctly. So quite a number of use cases. And and these are the issues that we described across the use cases, then they don't apply to all of the use cases throughout, but in in total, these are the issues we observed. The one thing is It's we're interested in in any cast type problems. So you have more than one service instance, meaning more than one choice available. You need to make a choice where to send the request. That's common across all the use cases, really. The decisions are usually dynamic, which means you want to you may want to change the choice where you actually send your transaction to frequently. And in some of the use cases, that's rather frequently, even down to single requests, In particular, if you have status requests like, you know, retrieving files or chunks from replicas. You can send that request to any of their replica, really, in order to be retrieved. and then some others, the the dynamisities. slightly slower We also have in some of the use cases aspects of what we call a femoral service instances. So if you use architectures like microservice architectures, service instances may appear or disappear rather quickly, And rather quickly, they're really means if you look at serverless. infrastructure in in in in less than a second or even less you you may deploy or ramp down an instance. the network location. Latency is an issue that that that that occurs across all the use cases. have an explicit resolution that takes time. And in some use case, we specify those or we quantify that time based on based on various measurements that are available. and and in some of the use cases, AAV is one of the example on the behalf of the use case draft.

Selections may be service specific. So what what fit for one may not fit to another. So we we outline, in some use cases, service specific stocks you make any cost decisions. need to accommodate those. They may not be the same across various services. deployments are distributed. So this is a problem where service instances may exist number of network locations. We are not really interested in instances being managed by a service platform, like, for instance, Kunetes in a single data center. that's the problem of the service platforms. But if it's occurs across different network locations, you have a routing problem, really. That's the that's that that's the point there. namespace mapping. Not everybody uses URLs. that may be surprising. But, you know, we found that in some of the use cases, we make reference to the quicker graph for instance of conagenants who uses a application ID scheme, are 128 bits as a shorter representation of very, very long URLs, and service chaining is another aspect. they so the the question that we're asking in the problem statement is what if he had similar end to end procedure, which is meaning it's initiated by client, very similar to the DNS. Of data communication, we've been inclined and what is the best choice of service instance, out of a set of possibly many service instances, but that procedure would significantly reduce the latency instead of having the the latency through an explicit resolution. And it also allows potentially for updating the assignments of the service instances rather frequently, least at the rights that are more aligned with the possibility to establish new service instances.

The next request is sent to another replica are? How can I do that? In particular, how can I do this without the need for an explicit out of discovery. If I do that discovery, it will cost me the latency. which again may be an issue. How could we improve on the update speed Does it really need to take minutes or longer to update the mapping the assignments between the service name and the best IP locator. so that it can go down to that right of service instance is being established. How could we incorporate service specific policies to address one of the issues we mentioned before? can we support individual or actually any application identifier, so not being limited to URLs only. Chaining is another question. How We do chining without an explicit discovery latency, but that that occurs. And last but not least, is the client with an operation. How can we avoid client driven operation that we have any transaction state in the network. You can see this in some of the solutions we looked at in the gap analysis, but there is a possibility to create transaction state in the network that may not be for a number of reasons.

We have found a way of doing it, and we also recognize that's not the only way of doing it. which then gives us the ability to at least have a stake in the ground to talk about. but also we made clear yesterday that that's not the starting point to say we have a solution. have a way of doing it, and we recognize the other ways of doing it. is exactly the discussion we want to have. We had quite a bit discussion yesterday, also thanks to Dino on, you know, is list a potential way of doing it, which it is. That's part of that was part of our initial or internal consideration as well. It's quite interesting to see how we could actually utilize list for addressing some of those problems. We discussed, in general, the validity of the problem, and I think there was some understanding for that problem. In a recognition, the problem does exist. in particular, in the use cases we presented. We also make clear that there is a huge range of use cases and huge range of users usage of the Internet. where that problem doesn't exist. So state and I and I think I tried to make this already. This is not a replacement of the DNS. The DNS works perfectly well for most of your that we're using every day."

And we're now in the discussions on possible advice forward with the the discussion on technology is trying to see where we can fit this item in existing work. If you don't find a good place in existing work, do we wanna create work that always sounds terrible. So it's probably preferable to find ways to do this in existing efforts. So they will be added verbally as this just what I did now. Please look through the notes in case you've made a to the site meeting. If you haven't made it, send, you know, questions and comments on this either to the list or to the individual authors, Louis Jens. Paolo or myself, and we will help you how to go forward. We hope that in next IETF, we can have more discussions on, you know, what we decided as a group. To go forward, we will keep routing working group list updated in a loose form because we have now an own mailing list. we obviously want to use as a focus of the discussions. And on the lost Oops. That does that. Yeah. It does go. if you have somehow find a linkage in your mind to what I am briefly presented here. Please join the discussion on the mailing list. It is growing, but we'd like to see more people there. And we'd like to see contributors. If this for some of the use case you are considering, please talk to us. We can either add you We still have a couple of use codes in mind ourselves, but love to hear use cases from other people as well. If you feel that there is a technology we are overlooking that may address happy to extend the gap analysis. And and if you even know how to solve it, brilliant, we we have a probably growing work on technologies that we'd like to do. And, hopefully, we'll be back in in Prague, worth telling you about new ways. So how that will look, we will decide until then until then."

How does this relate to cats? because a a big problem of the cast is to for the ingress routes to figure out which routing instance to use and there. And then how to check traffic there. So that seems to be ready to So so the the the Gavin on this draft outlines that in more detail. then probably I will have time to say it. So CATs is one of the because it was mentioned the last time, one of the aspects that we we have a closer look at. The one thing is, of course, Cant has 2 orthogonal things that it looks at. It's the computer brand as part we don't care about computer awareness specifically. We have some use cases where computer awareness is one of the drivers, but not all of them. I would say, the majority are not particularly computer aware. And the other part is the TS part, the traffic steering, which is what you mentioned. And that is something where where we we feel there's still a a different angle to how this starts. Cat is cats is more an in network decision mechanism to make traffic steering decision within the actual interest notes. which is not the starting point where we started. We started with the way the DNS works. where application developers usually make a decision through the resolution service. So it's a it's it's a different starting point, and it addresses, therefore, also much potentially wider scenarios are not necessarily compute. aware centric. more details we have in the part. They they also technology aspects. So at least that's a bit difficult, of course, to judge at the moment because cancer is fairly young. But you can, of course, see technology work emerging, and we have more comments in the to that to the differences. But that's a little bit premature because cats is fairly, fairly new. So we also don't want to presume cats going in a certain direction and then later be accused that they are kinda, like, directly. We're not doing that. we just look at what's currently out there, and we are we are invest we are observing the differences."

Perfect. Shall I go ahead or Please go ahead. Introduce yourself on why you're here. Alright. So thanks a lot, Jeff, and Ingen. So this is Nicola from Sion project, and I would like to give you today an update about Sion. and specifically to present the control plane. I'm here together with my colleague Kareem, who will take over at half of the presentation. So in case you have wondering what cyanide is, and you have not heard about it before, Sion is a path aware Internet architecture that started a few years ago in research, and it focuses on 3 fundamental properties availability, not only in case of failures, but also presence of adversities, security, especially when it comes to the routing part and scalability. And over time, it's kind of slipped out of the lab. So today, it is in production use by a few ISPs in Switzerland. It now powers part of the Swiss interbanking network. There's even multiple implementations And that is why I think for the project, it is really important to get clear specification, So if you're wondering more about, for example, the motivation"

    "text": "And and if you if you want to get an overview about scion, I can recommend you to have a look at the overview draft. cyon itself is actually composed of a few components, and that's why to clarify that we also wrote a component analysis draft that tries to clarify what each component is doing, what the inputs, outputs are, and how they relate between each other. So last time that we presented Cyan at this working group, we briefly presented PKI that was back at 115 in London. And today, actually, we have a new draft that presents another component, the control plane, which is actually the one doing the routing. So I hope this will be of interest of this working group. So before we get into the detail of the routing part, I wanted to quickly introduce some fundamental concepts that's and introduce the 3 main components. So on the right side, you see an example topology And in this apology, there's 19 autonomous systems the the little notes here. And this these ISS are grouped into what we call isolation domains. and isolation domains offer isolated routing planes and each ISD has its own root of trust. And within each isolation domain, there are some ASS that have some special functions they are the so called core a s's that you see circled in in gray on top. later on, we will clarify their role. So cyan is an architecture that is based on potsegments and endpoint pass control. So the data plane is fetching this segment and combines them into end to end parts that in the end are used to send traffic to any destination. And this endpoint path control is actually enabled by including the desired forwarding path directly into the scion packet header. So here you see a very high level examples"

    "startTime": "01:44:00",
    "text": "Example, And that means that Sion routers are relatively simple. They just look at the next hope in the in the packet already, and then they come forward packets but also statelessly. this path have to be provided by something, and that's where the control plane the routing part of scion kicks in. So the control plane is actually discovering past information, and then it disseminate disseminates it down to the endpoints. information is also authenticated. And it is important to remember that routing is based on this ISDAS couple as a routing locator, So this is somehow decoupled from end host addressing. that can reuse existing addressing schemes, for example, ipv6 or ipv4. And as this information is authenticated, that's why Sion has its own PKI, it provides its, let's say, unique trust model where it where each IST has its own roots of trust. and it makes this certificate available to the other component. A few words about interoperability you have seen that scion packets are a little bit different And that's why there are transition mechanisms like the scion 2 IP gateways, these are not part of this draft. We briefly mentioned them in the overview draft. besides that, cyan has no prefixes on-site routers, So that's why transition mechanisms usually leverage RPKI for origin validation And when it comes to routing, scion is inter domain only, so that means that within an autonomous system, cyan is reusing the existing infrastructure, the existing routing protocol, and the existing forwarding. cyon only acts at the inter domain part."

    "text": "Ultimately, path selection is left to endpoints, so this can be potentially integrated with existing path selection mechanisms. I already see my colleague, Corinne, online, so I'm gonna hand over to her for a deeper look at the routing part. Thank you, Nicola. Yes. I'm now going to explain the control plan routing process a little bit in more detail. Can you understand me? if it's okay. Yeah. You sound good. Okay. Sounds. So the routing process and sign consists of say, 3 phases or or stages or processes, First is about really discovering a valid path through what we call beaconing. This is the exploration phase. And there, we discover passes between the course of an end adsolation domain. This is called inter ISD beaconing or core beaconing. And then the intralized date beginning is the the discovering of pass from the court to the child's ASs. So this is downwards in a way. And then, ASs sign, ASs can select past segments and make them available to other ASs. this is called or this happens in the registration phase. n each AS can freely choose the algorithm and the criteria based on which they see those past sections which they want to make available to other a s's? And the beginning happens from the core to the down to the child but a a pass segment which is registered can also be used in the other direction, so up. And then in the end, this is done to be able to communicate"

And this phase is called a resolution or the lookup and combination phase. in this look up part the ASs the sign ASs look for past segments towards the destination AS, and this happens in the control plane. and then the actual combining of these past segments into an end to end pass. it happens in a data plan. And the the first processes to explore exploration and the registration happens by the sign control service, which each sign AS has. and the endpoint is really responsible for the resolution. So I go with a little bit more in detail about the duration or the beaconing phase. This happens by core AS's day periodically sends so called pause construction beacons to start this exploration of parts. they are either sent to other core ASs either within one isolation domain or also So to another isolation done domain, And the other way is to send these beacons top down from parent to child, which is then the intra IST weakening. And if has received beacons, and they put a decon store and pair propagation period, which is can define themselves. each day AS also selects a subset of this receives PCBs again, according to their own needs and selection criteria, they append routing information to this PCB about the routing"

So these PCBs, they accumulate cryptocafically graphically protected pass and forwarding information on their way per traverse AS, basically, one PCB contains 1st timestamp the moment, it was initially sent by the core AS. There's also a mentioning of the expiration time, which cost in PCB is not valid forever. It has an ID it consists of a list of all aliases on the past with is which it has proper so far. And Yes. As I see routing sign routing information per AS. So an e s, sign a s, not only propagates PCBs, but it can also store or register selected PCDs as persegments. we have up pass and down pass segments, the car segments, they are chosen by an EAS and they represent how this AS wants to communicate with its core ASs with the core of s its isolation domain and an AS source these OPPA segments in its own local control servers. And the down part segments are how an AS wants to be reached by other ASs and other entities. And this these segments are registered with the control services of the relevant core AS in in their own in the core of past segments and down past segments do not have to be the same by definition, And this all is done. This routing is done in the end"

AS, which happens in the control plane, and then it combines this in an end to end pass, which happened in a data plane. And this looking up required. So looking up past segments requires the lookup of up to 3 cost segments to be able to then in the end combine an and and and and and and and complete end to end path. First, you have you need an upper segment. to read the core in your own source isolation domain, your own isolation domain, And this OPPA segment is delivered by the control servers of the source AS, so the control surface of the source endpoint. Then you may need a corporate segment to connect the core of your isolation domain with the core which is connected to the destination AS. This other core AS can be located in their own ISD, but also in another isolation domain, and this core pass segment is delivered by the control servers of the core AS in their own isolation domain. And in the end, you need a down pass segment to be able to connect to the destination AS, and this is delivered by the core AS the control serves of this core AS in the ISD of the destination. the endpoint AS. So you have to add an and source. Endpoint has to request a couple of past segments and to efficiency, it is recommended requesting these power segments in parallel.

Then assign is developed or designs with security in mind, there are also a couple of security measures which make this process in the control plan secure. 1st I already said that PCBs are signed by each ASDA trigger traverse. in an onion fashion way, that means that an AF does not only put a signature on its own contribution, the own it writing information about his own AS, but also puts this signature on all the other the routing information of all the other ASs. And then every AS should verify the routing mass and I can do that by following the certificate chain. Then the specific routing information, the hop information one AS like the the ingress and Egress interfaces They are also authenticated by means of Mac message authentication code. And this is checked by the routers during the forwarding of the packets, and each AS should only forward traffic on paths that are explicitly authorized. And then as my colleague Nikola already blend in sign, we have to sign control and PKI which is coped on isolation domain level. So the routes of trust are also only on this i ISB level or scoped and this makes it very, yeah, almost impossible for low global kill switches to to appear.

Thank you. but So other questions or comments or or already now? Thanks, Karim. So question to you, having write out the documents, they are very handwavy about convergence times, And we care not only about security, reliability of Internet also about how long does it take to converge How long does it take for particular failures to be awarded. There's some text about use multi pausing Yes. you know, have the failures, but unfortunately, we can't always have the failures. So more tangible data on actual conversions times, reaction of protocol to different failures would be very much appreciated. And IT really cares about these parts of routing. Yes.
