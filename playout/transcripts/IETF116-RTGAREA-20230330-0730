Not like the routing area working group in that this is not a working group. Is where your Ad is set up in front and we talk about things related to the routing area So here's our agenda for the day. We have a note taker. Thank you very much. We are gonna have group reports from three of our working groups Jeff H has volunteered to talk about lessons learned from working on the Epic bg yang. Module and we're gonna review quickly high points of the Ip policy. If you had something else you wanted to talk about and what to have recognized now. Speak up?

None of us is actually expert in them is why we're having the why you're having the session. And it's also why many of you have legal counsel of your own that you should really be talking to if you want to know important details about these because I am not your lawyer and I never will be.

I think he's done an epic job, I for one and really gonna miss him sitting up here in the front with us. Because people are always throw tomatoes in his direction because they gotten most used to him. But I'm really grateful that he's not going far and he has already volunteered to do some document reviews and working groups that I've been sitting in with him this week. So really, thank you.

The problem with that is you have to have two, you have to have two For a given piece of information be a prefix for a link. I mean, a given an object in the late state protocol prefix or a link. For all v three, we went ahead and we went through the backward compatibility with Ro eighty three sixty two. And we made Os three fully extend.

Unlike Isi where you only have really one granularity which is the, you know, the Ls, you can have... There's you can have it any as many different types of Ls as you want, and you can extend them arbitrarily of Tl.

The second care category is for what I'd like to cat call protocol maintenance. Is where we just, like, advertise one more thing. And and as you probably know if you've come to the Ls r working group. We have this ongoing debate on what information should go into the Ig and what should not. But we've you know, in many cases, we allow we out other routing area at least other routing areas stuff to go in in into the protocol. And be advertised within the Isi or Os routing domains in in the Ig piece. Now the those are the two kind of foundational categories.

We've been working on segment routing those are, you know, extensions stuff And F to advertise information needed to set up the Mp or Sr v segment routing data plans.

And the color routing know proposal from Cisco. And the very high level version of this idea is, no you probably want routes especially B p routes that carry things like next steps.

We unfortunately did not have a clean consensus as to which one of these things we're going to adapt both of them have slightly different operational paradigm and now each of them makes slightly different situations easier. Due to the lack of consensus, we've adapted both as experimental the and we'll progress each of them for the time being independently. And we'll be defining procedures for these things. Next slide.

I find it very likely without having done the page count that the beach be out joel will probably be not the size of every single Ig gang battle itself.

We expect to be receiving a steady stream messages And if we don't hear from you anytime and you know, some negotiated whole time. We're gonna hang up the phone. You know, the sessions is gone. But what happens if you're trying to send something, and it's just simply not accepting the packets, but you're still getting a steady stream as a direction. And this can happen for a number of reasons. But, you know, mostly it's because he b user zero window. There's other circumstances this can happen and it's reasons like this that pretty much every Bg developer ends up being at least a no level expert in terms of how Tcp works. Every other protocol in Etf that makes you use of Tcp is subject to the same considerations, but usually less painfully. So what we have going on in draft discussion right now, there's is a draft likely to be adopted know for the B send hold timer idea that if we're trying to push something in it doesn't go through for long enough. Again, we probably wanna hang up the session. And we've got stale information in the network. This is bad. We also have a submission that attempts to make use of a feature from Tcp, that's know, that well implemented but present in this for examples in Linux stacks. That basically says that if there's a missing x segment that we haven't gotten act in a reasonable amount of time Well, this is good enough for reason to also hang up the phone.

Places where we have bumps that occasionally come back to bite us is changes in the fundamental selection behaviors, when those sorts of things happen, we can end up with inconsistent route selection.

Is that, you know, the extensions are plentiful, you know, easily as plentiful as some of the other protocol mechanisms we have to actually figure out what all these things mean operational content wise. So we we started with idea that we need to have minimally a core set of content. We need to make sure that the structure is correct, especially for things that impact indexing. You don't get a chance to change your indexing without basic be replacing stuff in your module, you have to get these things right in this took a lattice of iteration unfortunately meant that there was a lot of feature creep going on and you know to figure out what's gonna be core what's not.

No. We're hopefully there now Important part is this is a level of continuous inspection. This is not waterfall model this is very much agile. Thanks slide, please. Features in terms of what Yang does as a language. Is a problematic thing. It's basically something that says this thing can actually be enabled or present in the model in the implementation or used by things clearing the model like Net cuff. And as a consequence, you know, there Those switches, I don't know is this thing present or not. And they just make things complicated across the board. Is worth avoiding. The case of open config, you don't get to use them at all. The case of Atf. We're building stuff Wide. We don't have the same rules that we do know for other organizations. We're trying to support what It is capable of doing not, you know, what a specific implementation does. So this gives us some flexibility. It also allowed us to just make some decisions, things like, you know, the B add pass feature is technically an optional extension, not pervasive deployed but we couldn't not include it as an idea because it impacted indexing of things like our routing tables. So, you know, this is an example. We're looking ahead was very important to get the job Right. Assuming mean that we actually do get a our job right.

So the continuous check is does this enable future forecast to happen? This does take some foresight? And we actually did test this part of things effectively unit test to integration test where hash would spend a lot of work saying, okay, well, we're trying to test this features extension what does a fake module that would use these things look like? Throw an integration we do validation on it and you know, multiple cases things where we're okay. We had to go back and redo it. Had we not done those exercises, you know, then we would have been stuck. These were things the gang doctors didn't notice the first round. We have to catch these things ourselves. Id and s and everything else are adding features all the time that are eventually going to augment these things. So this was a critical step. Protocols that are, you know, less ex or more localized. Maybe this isn't the problem that's still, you know, good wisdom. Probably one of our biggest... The pains for some of this stuff involves certain types of extensions, you know, for things like our extended community features. Something you probably recognize from Vpn technologies is things like route targets. In order to actually support those for a core data type, that's maintaining type death inside of yang, you know, this is a string.

Making the changes and reassuring this. And somebody who and wearing a different hat in the B working group that got something wrong it was trivial long. It was easy to fix, and it still took much of a year before it actually rep an Rf. The penalty is very high. So making sure that we can delegate things so that we don't have to keep coming back to the working group for specific maintenance for base components is critical that our throughput. What this means is in terms of gang language features, avoiding them, seems are very handy because they have good tight binding to values. But many cases, use identities, they're effectively number this, but they're easily to extend. Extended communities is an example of a type def that we require frequent maintenance, and we're going to see flavors of this pop up is problems across you know, future work which will probably go back to routing bur group and all of the Vpn service models at some point in the near future. Slide. And This is the example here. Mean know, define route targets, route origins and all these things that are eighty two ninety four. They weren't done as I end maintain. We're gonna have to go back to fix these things back to routing working group properly, probably conjunction the Id idea. To see about making the fixes we'll have to see if procedure currently allows us to delegate these later into Ian, will be an interesting conversation for, you know, the Net shares and such.

We also have interesting things for routing in general. This is modeling question that people get choices at. Say protocols have bit fields. And Yang does a wonderful job to render these things when you know they are what they mean. You can model them different ways. You can use the actual bits type you can use identities. But No identity they'll give you a hint as to where the things live in the protocol. That's not relevant for you. Sometimes that's a perfectly fine representation. Ig as example, make use of identities for a lot of their information. Trouble is what happens if you're a protocol and you want to actually see, I got a packets that had some flags in it. That I don't know what they are. You know, this happens is part of ex ability all the time. And if you're trying the debug things that you think might be related to one of these features for maybe a packet of that passes through your system to add something else. You you want that visibility. So you do about it well? I promise if it's not defined. Well, you have to do something about the unknown. There's no such thing as a default for, know, the bits. If you sign a bit name, you can't change it. And, know, trying to figure out to do about that if you're coming to the net mud tomorrow, I'll be talking about a methodology for dealing with this where we have well known pattern fried unknown bits.

Bg makes use of, you know, policy extensively and we're by the motivation for some of the things that happened to the It policy module, consequence of that is that know things and policy weren't correct, and had we not caught it before again E? They would've shipped it maybe they failed to do it again. Same thing was true for B. Add configuration module for B that was used by multiple protocols including Dg. We got it mostly right, but we only got it mostly right because we did the integration and tried to use it via examples. Tcp, very similar. The tcp working group had to actually by way they thought they were done with their module. They're about hit rf. Got sort of last minute requested to do review. It was broken.

We will never have enough eyes on the work for this sort of thing that number of people that normally care about, it is not big enough. And the changes can sometimes be disruptive large. Standard source control for development models for doing things helps out. You do your work in small pieces, you get your eyes on individual components review. You have ideally continuous integration. A hashtag had a wonderful build environment where you check out a container. You do all your changes, you can do a make and you get the draft out that's been validated with examples. So collaborative environments and the tooling is a big deal spend the effort on it in your own working groups. Exciting. Conclusions. Doing the work in shorter period time, would have actually reduced a lot of her pain. You know, the problem we have is just simply that we go are all here regularly in these rooms across the planet, but we have our bursts in terms of our cycles This means that our attention span is not really focused.

You have to get the structure right ideally for strong, but if you don't, getting it right harder and later around is harder.

So as I mentioned at the beginning, I'm not your lawyer. But we, you know, sort of in recent times in one of our working groups have had seemingly some confusion about what is and isn't allowed with respect to talk talking about and thinking about Ip r, so we thought we'd do a quick review of some of them high points from Bc seventy nine.

But section seven has a lot of the the most relevant information for for this topic. And section seven leads in with in general Etf work group preferred technologies is with no known Ip claims or for technologies with claims against them an offer of royalty free licensing. So I don't want to get into the in general Atf working groups prefer thing. That's not a requirement. Certainly not a requirement that a work group must do this. It's just sort of a general statement of what the authors of eighty one seventy nine believed, was true at that time. But what it does demonstrate is that it's clearly, allowed, it's written in the our process document. It's not required, but it's allowed for participants to consider things related to licensing terms when they're deciding what support with respect to a draft. And it's also in scope for working groups to discuss matters related to licensing terms. Now Sometimes people want to spill over from talking about licensing terms which is also interesting not to talking about the the of Ip because that looks more like engineering and they can look at that and say I'm an engineer and I I'm gone and read this patent, and I'm gonna talk about how it's a bunch of bs s.

However, what people use as input into making their own decisions is their own business. So what all this mean about working group procedure. Well, eighty one seventy nine is a very broad and general framework, and every working group can have its own procedures and it's own way of working. But a few reminders. We participate in the As individuals. And each individual When they're thinking about what a working group is gonna do with the draft, what they're contribution to the working group consensus is. They should be thinking about each draft. Has its own thing.
