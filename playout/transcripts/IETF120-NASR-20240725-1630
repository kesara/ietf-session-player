Yeah, sure. I think feel free to take the mic All right, good morning, everyone This is our Thursday session one We are going to be discussing the notion of doing network attestations for secure routing. This is a non-working group forming box So I just wanted to make that clear. The session is being recorded I've got Peter and Hank, who's just left Not a good sign as our note takers. So with that, let's go ahead and get started because we have a full agenda Next slide, please. So it is now Thursday Who are new attendees to the IETF? Great. Oh, okay So hopefully you've attended other sessions so you're familiar with our processes and procedures So just please note the well well Next slide, please. So meeting tips, also again make sure that those that are here scan the QR code so that we can tell and gauge the level of participation so that presumably we have another boff, we can schedule the right size room"

Okay, so um again thanks again to the note takers We do have a Datatracker for this as well as a mail list. So again, hopefully you're all prepared note takers. We do have a Datatracker for this as well as a mail list. So again, hopefully you're all participating in the mail list. There's they've started a proposed charter, but I think in this session, we want to make sure that everybody in understands the problem, the intent and we can get into the discussion of relevant into the IETF. So next slide, please. Okay, so resources will just, when, over that. So agenda bashing, I'm going to do a quick call believing that everybody has looked at this and you can look at it right now. We do have a very full agenda. I want to make sure that we allow enough time at the end for discussion so that we know what we need to do moving forward as the next steps So with that said, I'm going to do a quick call to see if there are any comments or questions Go ahead, Michael. Yeah, Mike Parrock here. Just a quick question Did I hear correctly, it's a non-working group? forming boff? Correct. There's a charter kind of in development, and this looks like a lot of materials that I would typically see in a working group forming boff. So I was just curious the stance on that timing approach to process here. Right. So part of this, Mike, is even on the first boff, it goes to the"

Because I think Roman as our IETF chair, has said, we get two trials to make sure that the community understands before we make that decision of whether we create a working group or not Was there any other? No, okay So let's get to why are we here? So Mike, this is what I started to say Discussions have started. There is a mail list already there. There was a side me meeting in Brisbane. And I think that was about the time that I was going to say the wiki. Sorry, it's Thursday, it's morning My brain is not quite functioning, apparently So basically, there are some documents there that are there to describe the understanding of the problem statement and intent So the two paragraphs that you're seeing here, I'm not going to read it. You guys are adults You can read it for yourselves. It's on both the GitHub and on the drafts, but it gives you the examples, or sorry, the description for the interest and intent that they want to pursue here and the IETI Okay.

Okay So, um things are you getting in the queue tour list yeah sorry i hadn't put out the notebook. Did you want to have comments on that kind of? pre-charter summary text here? No No We'll have that in the discussions Okay. So during the side meetings and even within the RAPS working group, there was discussion, there's a draft in the Rats Working Group on how we could achieve I think that draft is called a trustee secure path and so the question that we're posing here and it's not so much a question, but because this is a non-for, session it's more to raise the awareness that there are other work groups, both in the security and then the routing area that have relevance or interdependence, if you will So rats, obviously, we're talking about attestations. That working group focuses on achieving remote attestations and so it would be those claims evidence, and verification that would help towards the secure rounding path um luigi you want to talk about the other work"

Yes so when the request for the both was submitted, the IESG asked clarification uh on the relation with subnet okay so the group discussed with chairs of Subnet and the conclusion was that the technologies will be orthogonal in a certain way, because some Subnet, you deploy it at the boundaries of your domain whereas whatever technology comes out for this effort will be deployed all along the past that you were to attest and secure and you want to have the proof of transit. And there is a text we agree upon, which is also here on the slides. There is a second relation is the pannur g we send an email to the chairs we didn't get a chance to talk with them but I'm sure we will work out as well a text that clarifies the differences Okay okay so getting on the queue yes okay please make sure you use the queue so we know yeah yeah sorry i and state your name and affiliation too especially for. Affiliation Retired but for a quarter of a century I was an operator I wonder you have secure routing in the title and the one long-term secure routing activity that has been this is not being mentioned That doesn't have a protocol.

Yeah there is some, some so the, the term that has been used can be missed On this we can agree and this was our comments we already received the point is these efforts is not about securing an existing routing protocol. It's not about it about cider for example okay is more about the routing is done. How to can choose a path that has the level of trust that I want okay And how can I ensure that actually my packets go through that so it's not about securing BGP or any IGP protocol. So we can agree that the terminology can be refraffable refined How do you do the stuff? on top if you have not secured? the underlying mechanism you're going to discover in the next presentations So sorry, I really need to make the comment so the problem is using the word trust without you know explaining trust to do what to be what right so that's, that's the missing thing, right? Is it you're just trusting that the routing protocol is working? that the forwarding is working, right? So that's So we are facilitating the session I think it behooves us to have the presenters present the users cases and the problem statement before we can have the discussion. Okay.

So for the internet style, it is a best effort model although there are some other methods like BGBSEC, it can only in ensure announcement security so they have no guarantee of each devices forwarding disease and even community forwarding results Now, new requirements appeared for secure routing.

The node is dependent and the node have security capabilities. This is a form of static security At stage two, I summarize it as a past computation and orchestration This is the responsibility of network operators, ensure paths dependable, and have cavit capabilities to anti-cyber attack through various means is in the scope of dynamic security At stage three, this is also the most important step, I think"

The protocol SRV6 SRI is adapted to pass computation and orchestration. But how to prove? that traffic really went through this series Existing technology cannot support it Let's see the youth case below. We also have some clients with high security UK requirements. It is not a completely new requirement in the past we used list lines to slow it However, the cost of list line is very, very high and the scope of list lines is limited by geography location. So we are trying to select trust paste with all trusted nodes This is an Elton alternative solution and can support the expansion of list lines series. So to summarize, these two use case needs orchestrate a pass in order and prove the traffic went through this service and also compute a forwarding path with high security requirements Next slide Oh, thanks"

Can you move on?

Sometime I go within the SFC group It's something that it was called Proof of Transit, and there is something that the one of the RFCs that was related to OIM was is part of what that's your have there the RFC The AV is that, well, proof of transit is based on if you are interested in the details, it's based on Shamir sharing secrets, and this is a computed is a shared secret that is computed node by node, and then is verifiable And there is a, we made a proposal for very fine as well order not only the traversal of the path. Using using link masks the idea here is, again, is that things you can do it even per packet it has a cost but you can do it even per packet or did you use it you dedicated IOM? packets to verify this from time to time? This is verifiable by anyone that is able to inject traffic in the segment that is being verified. So what third part can make a further verification. The customer itself it's for themselves and whoever is a can, can act to that, can be that the path properties are being verified because you're following that. Can you move on, what we are we are proposing is is precisely mixed both of them, so you can link the process of a of establishing the path by means of these tipia and very fine that proof of transited there, verifying the identity of those elements that are going to take part in the proof of traffic in the proof of transitory, and that to generate and verify the traffic as it happens in the"

I mean, with this species, this is pieces, this is something that can happen inside the domain And again, we have been making experiments with it Can you move on? And, well, the idea is that, well, there are several issues that we believe are important. When is about the order? When you're trying to make proof of transit, it's not the same that you have the firewall and then the IDS or before the IDS and then the firewall this is all there is important and the idea is to work in that direction and these things in the in the draft dimension we have this masks what we think is that we could derive the masks from the the these things in the in the draft dimension we have these masks. What we think is that we could derive the masks from the from the from the from the state that are changed during the, uh, the, in the station, uh, failure And second is about whatever it has to do with interdomain. It is important as well that we can go beyond a single domain, and the idea is how we exchange the material that is relevant for this. In the case of that station, we're talking about the golden values that are going to use for the exit a certain path in the case of proof of transit is how we coordinate the sharing secret mechanisms and i think and we intend to make these issues part of the of the working and I think and we intend to make these issues part of the of the of the working this matter and that's all, as far as I can tell. Yeah, I know that really was looking at me Go ahead, Roy. roy williams, Microsoft. I had a quick question, Diego. This seems to assume that you have a static network.

Yeah, last one last one. Okay, this one. Yeah, I, I will, I, know that you last sentence, no protection against additional notes in the past many meter right and I don't know the POMT, what does it mean? Is that proof of non-trade? Okay, okay. But do you mean that the current POT cannot protect against this? Or you mean, you can solve this? Yeah, yeah, no no I mean something you are never protected again is that passive tapping is something that you can simply do. If I have physical access to a to a wire I can I can I can call against is that passive tapping is something that you cannot simply do. If I have physical access to a wire, I can copy traffic.

Let me insist about this secure. If you notice, I have not made mentioned the word secure, I'm talking about validation That's first thing. Second, whether you interpret it as a security property of trustworthiness or whatever is up to you that's say in the eye of the beholder.

So in, we if in traditional setting, of course, everything are physical and there is no tunnel network. And also, many problems assume that in their is some kind of uniformly content local networks but in this setting, tracing traffic is very easy because everything is physical and locatable next slide please but in reality especially in the inter-domain setting, we have overrace in so many layers, not limited to VPNs, but local network are managed using several overlay technologies. And there are so even if the if we track route traffic is going in this path, passing switches and routers everything was in in fact virtual so And also we have a very complex configuration for infrastructure as a code setting So assuring is, as he said, very difficult in the real setting next please so this is one example setting for consideration so we have the traffic originator and destination in the right side, but it is connected by passing so many operators and middle passes VPN connection like this"

And what is the expected correct state is not as simple solution and also we if we do this kind of verification is shared the expected, the correct state is not a simple solution. And also, if we do this kind of verification in the shared infrastructure, we should care that the attestation service will not be some information about other customers And also virtualization is making things very difficult. Next please So this is my kind of proposal, a stormer, for how we do by defining some kind of services for the past characteristic verification so we put some past characteristics service for each operator. And next please And the customer can query. Wow he or she wants the traffic to be served like if their ultimate goal is going to server B but it should fast within the network operator A he trusts some in some sense this network, but it should be with log like using another this working with technology and VPN pass is encrypted but still he wants this code communication like within the European Union or something like that for the legal restriction and network operator B is in some sense, not trust, so they don't happen a requirement or something like that"

And also important point is if a VPN is required in some cases, that this second tunneling network must also be verified. In that case, they can ask PC for the services in the underlying network or something like that so can you saw this slide number? Then next please then he can the PCS service it can get please. Then he can, the PCS service, they can gather the responses and they go back to the originate as an attestation response.

I think that the Lucas between endpoints and the control plane are based on some RPCs, but then there is kind of a like recursive process where you go to your own AS and then if you need to go somewhere else and you AS can cache or get segments to sign on control plane.

So the ideas to rely on mechanisms that include the attestation of the AI, the use of a secure environment or a secure network environment, and to increase the and to guarantee that the flow of data has been the proper has not been going outside of the intended border etc the idea is to add on top of all of this, in addition, the verification of the path, that the path has a certain, this certain characteristics that I was a trying to exemplify during my talk.

Can you move on? Well, basically this is about the proof of residency that, as you know, is something that is probably one of the use cases that originally, or at least in our case, originally moved us to explore these ideas that the data is not leaving a particular geographically uh domain. And, well, Raki is here We were discussing about the dose regulations that could imply a series implications for for a data residency and what they are the, uh, GDPR in the EU, some German regulations and down down they are see is the GDPR in the EU, some German regulations, and even here, or no, down in the U.S. HIPA Can you move on? Well, that's a as a let me see what we see and when discussing this with Ranky talking, about NASA and the technologies for path validation is not only, is using NASA as a additional evidence to verify that everything was behaving as expected and according to a regulations. So the idea is that to be sure that the I will not say be before Falkera stands up is not about the routing system, it's about the forwarding rules in the path, but this is something that's we have to, probably we have to qualify carefully if we start to, prepare a charter proposal and making it in combination with other elements that can be used"

But I could totally see that. I mean, what are your thoughts around the resiliency questions and things like that? What kind of cases do you see would merit the additional overhead here to add? that extra layer? It's not that it's not potentially a valid layer. It's just I want to understand more there So good question So I think two aspects. One is I would like to highlight on the importance of availability, right? If you don't have a trustworthy routing system especially which work across multiple vendors and, you know, clouds, then you have fundamental problem. Basically, if which work across multiple vendors and clouds, then you have fundamental problem, right? Basically, you can be on a culture. And then just like the recent, crowd strike incident, basically your service is functioning right, but just not available from networking perspective. And second, second even though the data is encrypt using layer four information such as IP addresses and ports, you can actually infer a lot about what's going on right and I want to remind you of the AT&T incident of call record where not the actual call details but just the phone number exposure was a pretty disaster situation. I think these are things where I think NASA would play a key role in kind of you know, ensuring availability and also the trustworthiness of even layered for information Hi, Ronki.

And then, uh, lose availability to service So the service is basically delivering the confidential in safety. Then that is also a big problem That's what I meant just from availability perspective Maybe I'll try to get out I guess I'm misunderstanding because my understanding from the little bit that I'm following along I mean, we had a software update applied and that was impacting endpoints I'm missing the routing element of it. No, no, no, the end was a similar pattern can happen with routers that's why I went with trustworthiness, right? I'm trying to draw similar patterns I'm not saying the exact pattern, just like that you know, secure updates to routers and trustworthy routing, you know, is essential for availability, network available just like endpoint, you know, service available correct. Roman, we have been discussing about this and my point when talking with with Ranker about this was more more about warranting the auditability of everything. So detecting where things happen So the track is not lost, more than Go ahead, Sue So, I would ask that the preparers for the slides be a little bit more detailed Safnet uses PGP, several of these things use speech and there's a lot of, work done to validate the AS, the ASPA and I don't see a lot of that, so it's difficult for me to figure out what you're really saying I suspect, and why is it different?"

And Diego, you know I'm all about rats and this stuff and the security, but I hope the next presentation will be a little clearer about exactly what you're going to do exactly where the holes are, so what we can try to do a good job of comp exactly where the holes are.

Thank you for that The chairs will take that under advisement This actually concludes the use cases presentations And we're going to have Peter actually consolidate the summary statement of those and then get to the problems statement so this is where we need that feedback Thank you, Nancy So having said with all these use cases, right now, we're trying to consolidate and then categorize them Next slide, please. So we kind of care categorize them as three categories So the number one is the leakage prevention of data during the wide area transmission. There could be more specific scenarios For example, like when uploading data from campus to data center or when campus is communicating with other campus or you're kind of training remotely from a data center to training centers. And also you have other data residency considerations, we all categorize them as data leakage prevention. How do you define leakage?"

And then the second is that we want to provide the you know, the option for the August operators to orchestrate connectivity or path that meets the client's requirements of the trustworthiness or security property and such that the operator can offer some more high security connectivity services that has more, you know, like leakage prevention guarantee or data residency guarantee or security level assurance guarantees. So the problem that is not, you know, limited to the security property we could also, you know, include some capabilities that are enabled, like some reliability or resilience guarantees that are, you know, they are presented as capabilities that are enabled. And a third one is the routing auditing, so we want to prove traffic that actually went through specific elements in preferably orders. And also they went through elements you know, trusted routers that has specific properties. So the number three will be complementing the one and two Next slide, please. Next slide So coming to the problem statement, one frequent question is that why a VPN or TLS between endpoints is not sufficient So to answer that straightforwardly, is that VPN does not perceive the underlying trustworthiness of the bearing network element. So the traffic could be accessed and processed by insecure devices and this would permit further attacks So like people will ask like, so what, right? So the traffic is encrypted. But they encrypted traffic could also be, you know, exploited for various attacks. So number one, it would be the crypto exploit. Now we have the quantum post-quivore areas coming.

That's an example just coming up. And then we have poor crypto engineering or poor crypto implementation, which is not uncommon The fourth one is that the crypto protocols are only secure, you know, until a new vulnerability is discovered So maybe some new protocols are still in experiment stage It's, if there's a possibility that future, you know, vulnerabilities could be these discovered So the number two is that in like the more accurate number two is that in like when like a I think the more accurate description is a privileged middle box. So when a privileged middle box is in between a two VPN time tunnels, like in a star topology, you kind of take the traffic from the first VPN tunnel and then you decrypt it and encrypt it and encrypt it again and send it to the next tunnel So this will be a plain tax exposure in the privileged middle box in the middle And then there could be also traffic analysis want to make sure, like, want to emphasize that a successful attack is not decrypting all information from the encrypted message. As you have, by cryptography definition, we can have more than negligible information from then he should perceive. So this could be like some pattern recognition from traffic analysis, like we're starting to know like this endpoint is starting its operation and maybe then we can, you know, carry on for some more cyber know, cyber attacks. So and the last one is that there will be no routing audit statement And next slide, please So the problem statement is that we want to achieve dependable hop-by-hop forwarding such that no deviation from a trusted path is is conducted and there's no, like, secret copying of encrypted data by those insecure entrepreneurs from a trusted path is conducted and there's no like secret copying of encrypted data by those insecure or untrusted devices so such that we can minimize the detailed leakage and exposure So why, like we said, the data could be encrypted, but still"

Because now we have rats, we believe something fundamentally has changed So I think we think this is a right time to propose. Like, how do we define a device? as trusted? Like for now, we can say like a device is integrity checked from bottom to up from hardware to off to operating systems all the way up to the configurations that performs the forwarding behaviors or forwarding, you know, decisions dependably And we think that's the definition for stressive devices and we want to connect them. So right now, because we have rats, before we have rats, we have no security assumptions of the routers, we have no control of them, we believe they are doing the best they can, hop by hop, but right now we have remote agitation, maybe some devices are remotely tested, and they have this integrity guarantee and some of them does not. So can we cherry? them and connect them and provide more secure connectivity service? Next slide, please so the long-standing problem is that if we want to achieve routing service, or if we want to achieve dependable hop-by-hide forwarding, there's usually a two-step process. So the number one is that we want to make sure the route information is correctly propagated, which is good. And this is what BGBSEC and the other works in the set our ops are doing right now. This is great But usually the second part we have no control over. So like we want to make sure the routing has, the router has obtained the correct routing information and is also making correct foreign decisions. Like before we have rats or we have other integrity measurement procedures there's no guarantee for a router that position this correct routing information and there's no guarantee it will do"

So if it's deployed in Internet, we assume there's no trustworthiness it's not trusted, is doing the best it can, and the correctly propagated routing information does not really guarantee correct forwarding If it deviates, it deviates. We have maybe methods of detecting it, but there's no way of controlling the behaviors. And if it's deployed in limited domains, we assume it's completely true Is it really un- unconditionally trusted? Maybe not, right? Maybe some devices in private domains, they are also, you know, out of, update, they're still untrusted. So this binary, very binary view of trustworthness is the problem, right? The real case, maybe that's not very binary Right now, because we have rats, we have more granular perspective of looking at the security properties or trustworthiness properties Right now, maybe some devices in Internet, they are trust We just don't know, right, for now Maybe some devices in limited domains are not trusted But now, when we have rats, we can have a more granular and a more deeper perspective, and then we can, you know, these devices, and we can only cherry pick all this trusted devices or remote-tested devices or devices with intent guarantees and we connect them and we provide a more secure connectivity service Next slide, please Right.

We want to only provide objective properties, security properties resilience properties, trustworthiness property We want to provide those options for the clients to choose from And whatever satisfies the clients require we can say that's trusted by this client. This client is happy. So right now, the purpose of our initiative, one of it is we want to provide all these options maybe like, for example, the BGPSEC is enabled, the young prominence methods are enabled, maybe flat deafening capabilities enabled. These are the requirements from the clients, and we pick the qualifying divide and connect them to make sure like the overall service meets the requirements of client. Next slide please. So the overall goal before we go to the proposed architecture the goal of Nazareg here is a three-step process The first one is that we allow clients to choose desired security or trust properties of his received network service. We want to provide those kind of options for the clients to choose from And number two is that by cherry picking all these quality devices to connect them, we should achieve the dependable forwarding, hop-by-hot forwarding, by routing only on top of qualifying trusted devices that satisfy the client's trust requirements And number three is that we want to prove auditable evidence that certain packets are important flows have traversed this required path or this connectivity that has certain trust or security properties"

Is this meant to be limited to an administrative domain I don't think it is, but that might be a way to construct it, or is it meant for the big internet or hybrid cloud? use cases? Right it's not limited to a private or limited domain it's because like some cases a long connection, connectivity service is wide, you know, spread geographically. Usually that needs operators to collaborate and across man different domains. I think the Fui from China Unicom has addressed that The thing is we want to define how do we exchange information, how do we define the formats?

Next slide, please so this is a diagram that the inner part has gone around a bunch and this is kind of one of the concepts that people had that there's, you know, a customer that has some needs to traffic between different locations and they're going to talk in some way to the network operator, get some stuff and then they're going to send some data in their test a tester on the left, using some kind of proof of transit mechanism.

I2RS I mentioned charra TPM Trava charra There's some other options about there. And I think that if you have a protocol that you think fix fits then or could be extended, then I think you know, mail list is a place to discuss it because ultimately when we get to a point where we say we're going to be chartering then we're going to be saying and we'll coordinate with the blah, blah, blah, working group if it's still alive.

There, that's the kind of thing that we need to figure out our architecturally, not necessarily for chartering reasons but we need to know if the question is that a question we are going to have to address or not And then we need to probably you know, we don't need to standardize the existing mechanism by which each operator does verification of the routing platform We can say this is the right rats mechanism the right thing, and there's clearly savings to implementers of orchestrators or other things that are going to do that of having fewer protocols.

So we need to share the concept of the orchestra orchestrator in this side why do you have to ask hard questions like that? What you want us to have a definition? So let's just say it's a thing that that arranges stuff and in an SDN space people know what that means and that device has the relationship there If you were not doing SDN if you were doing, and there's a lot of discussion in some of the dogs documents about SRV6, for instance but let's say you're just doing OSPF, across your network, right? Then it's probably a device that has to go and collect all the evidence, the attestation evidence, from your things okay? And it has to provide that API to the left and the API to the right. And if you have a better term that's more generic, then I would love to put it in my slide okay thank you so my understanding that okay so orchestrate the existing network have a better term that's more generic, then I would love to put it in my slide. Okay, thank you. So my understanding is that orchestrator is orchestrating the existing network, and we want to verify that, not orchestrator of our architecture or something like, orchestrator, underlying network. I think it goes and orchestrates non-attested paths too, but so to me, leveraging that that system is there if someone says oh no no no but I don't want to mix my secure and unsecured or my verified and unverified routing, then you maybe you need two platforms or I don't know I think that we can define the AP to the left and to the right And I think that rats can define or can document the APIs up and down okay, and then we cannot worry about"

Go one more back Yeah, okay. Thank you very much It's kind of messy. Yeah, I agree with your definition Thank you. Sue So just to put a little history on it I2S is not a protocol It was a working group that defined models and additions to the Yang functionality which took some time to get into it In addition, at the same time, we were trying to do with you had, Michael, which is I2NSA to get into it. In addition, at the same time, we were trying to do what you had, Michael, which is I-2 NSF. Now, we didn't get a lot of feedback when I worked with that. So been there, done that, got the T-shirt, want to know why we're gonna work this time. So you're right. So I2RS is really a set of Yang modules. And so really, really if I were to label these arrows better, then I would really be saying this is rest comp No, I would not. This is not not that way okay well if you're doing TPM Chara, then you're probably just I would not. This is not not that way. Okay, well, if you're doing TPM Chara, then you're probably doing rest comp. And so the belief I have is that whatever your management protocol, you're north side from your devices to your SDN, whatever that protocol is, that's the one we want to extend with evidence So if I'm mislabeling it, that's because I'm not a routing person. And I would love to know what protocol I should put on that label as yeah, there's mixed yes, okay.

And then I heard you kind of talk about, well, it's not limited domain. It's kind of something else. And I know we had a lot of use cases, so I don't want to conflate. So like, help me understand Who are the parties in this path so so what is the you an example from the the stuff that I end understand from other place. So the scion people in the room, please jump up and tell me what I'm completely insane My understanding, for instance, is that in Switzerland there's a requirement that ban exchange information when they do their stuff that that traffic remain in Switzerland So specifically, no fiber between Geneva across Lake Geneva through France to the other part of Switzerland that's to the south of that. If you know the geography, it's got this like you know, you can't do that. You've got to go around the lake all right the other way and so that's an example of you have to stay in the country, which means that you have to so there were some diagrams that peters had a better one where he had the green routers in the middle and the other ones there Okay. And so in that case, customer aid is, you know, Credit Suisse and Customs B is, I don't know, another Swiss bank, so for me, someone said a name, anyway, some other bank, you know Bank of Zurich, right? And so they have a requirement, but they don't, of course, want to buy all their internet from the same operator. They want to have a market of internet connectivity. They're going to buy it from the right guy, from the friendly guy, but the requirement is that these guys have to provide a evidence, auditable evidence that it stayed within Switzerland. And so that's what we need to have a different AP across this. The evidence has to flow back and forth and the banks ultimately have to put it in their audit log so that later on when they get audit,"

I don't know if I got that assessment and that distinction from some of the way the other use cases clarified internet not internet, domain, how much provider intermix with kind of customers. Is it endpoints? Is it just? kind of management devices? I'm struggling a little bit. Yeah, I would make up a silly term like unlimited domain. I don't know right? It's not open, but it's that would be a terrible word, but you know I mean, I think you can absolutely do that, but then the internet threat model applies and, you know, there's a conversation. And I think that this is an appropriate thing to say is that actually these are people that are want to route traffic over pieces of the internet where the internet threat model applies and they want some assurance that you know bent fiber didn't happen right Sorry, I don't know. Yes, that's Gunther speaking as an individual here. So actually I have a clarifying question if you can go further one slide. Back one more. So I should just clarify given that you can. These are, yeah. I'm just gonna say I'm looking at the agenda time with Luigi so we're just into the open like discussion and I also want to say these are straw man slides which you should hate and encourage you to which is going to encourage you to write a better slide. Yeah, right I think as the chairs, you're providing diagrams, and that's what we're trying to assess right? Of are these, well, it's not that they're the right diagrams, because you're saying they're ugly, but it's to help this audience understand the problem statement that the constituents are presenting and if there's confusion, so as Roman asked the question, there's are things that we can come back and clarify"

Oh, there's no route in this picture no it's like further round further round something with next. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Here, here, here here. So the connection between that green router and the blue router is that actually a link the in operator one that green router to blue router inside the gray box? Yeah, yeah so there's an arrow there you know yeah is that a link that's a forwarding link yeah a forwarding link yeah so can this be a tunnel? Of course so one of the objectives of a tunnel is that it sends traffic over it, but it hides the under topology. Yes people don't like that's exactly it would be bad if it was a tunnel that we couldn't attest to right? So people would prefer not to put a tunnel in there. They would prefer to put, like, you know an SR6 for forwarding thing which could which would actually have evidence from every hop, but would still be a circuit and not a tunnel so so so like you know the way i look into it you have like two orthogonal requirements here one is you use a tunnel to hide the underlay and then with this technology you want to actually show the on underlay. Right. Yeah. Interesting yeah and i i i don't so so what i perceive as it means is that you will not be tunneled by uh between two things within the the uh the a s encapsulating, you will be putting a mark like SR6 for instance such that you now could see each hop that along the way Maybe I'm saying it in a silly way because I'm really not a routing guy But anyone else?

When it comes to intradomain, the approach of Sion is that we assume that we trust the autonomous system So I think here maybe there might be a gap that where the two things could be integrated but there is a bit of difference and of course Zion, in the way that this is deployed today, it doesn't do proof of transit as well which I think is something we discussed a bit on the chat So I just wanted to comment on that Thanks.

So like, I see some concerns that could hit populations in disaster recovery scenarios or economic warfare types situations. That all being said, I think that this work is going to proceed anyway. So it would be much better for this work to happen in the open with good guidance and us thinking clearly about like, well, it looks really brittle and fragile. Great. Now let's go try to tackle some of those brittle and fragile problems or maybe the and us thinking clearly about like, well, it looks really brittle and fragile. Great, now let's go try to tackle some of those brittle and fragile problems or maybe there's some good guidance around how we can prevent abuse of this in certain areas and certain security properties. We may want to ensure a exist when these types of systems are deployed So that's kind of where my brain is at now. I'm definitely open for other feedback and thoughts, but it feels like something that's going to happen regardless, probably better for it to just happen with good feedback in from last of parties.

So consider like the ban in the country bank one and bank two you know communicating through multiple hops, through whatever region And the problem is when there's two network operators, this are architecture kind of works. When you're getting to 10 banks, 10 network operators, and stuff in between, then I fail to see how this scales when you're also trying to tie this into the internet architecture, which then has other clients to these networks operators that don't care of whether they get a trusted path So then without getting into how do you do this without multi-hap? source-based routing techniques with packet marking to say, well, this bank needs to send money to this bank and it can only go over a trusted path with no overlays, because we've sort of dropped that as a solution space, right? And yet this other person, you know, might be coming from a client, from a customer client, you know, through a network operator that just wants to go to the web page of the bank And so I fail to see how you can do this In an air gaps, you know, network, this works great but in an air gap network, you also don't need it. So so I think that one of the things, Wes, you should look at it and it's difficult in some ways to present things multiple things. But you should understand, the reason I put routing symbols at the bottom of this and the previous thing's just set of testers is because I really wanted to show the fact that we're actually in the forwarding plane down there And that and the customer B has this path evidence that it actually needs to evaluate So there's a header that's actually been added that has this proof of transit that is in the forwarding some people argue it's too costly blah blah"

Ruder doesn't think the customer is willing to pay for it, but, but, but, point is that if they have paid for it, then they do have something on the packet that arrives that they can evaluate. So they can either put that packet into their wire transfer system if it's legitimate, or if it's coming from a source address, they don't care if they trust then it's going to get to their web server appropriately, right? So I don't think that it's a problem that the traffic arrives potentially you know over a single link not air gap because it is marked and it's marked in a cryptographical way that they can actually assess Does that make sense? You look very skeptical to me Okay Okay there you go. Just like, well, the two comments, but I guess they are related. One is what Wunter was mentioning about TANU tunnels. The idea is not to expect the tunnel or the details of the tunnel. The idea would be that if you're using a tunnel, I can provide you some kind of evidence that the tunnel doesn't leave Switzerland or Elbonia. This is connected as well with a microwave was saying, the kind of protection that you can put in not exposing all the details, whether the topology or personal, etc cetera, it's something that is a point that at least is in my mind and not saying that this is in the, and we can reflect it in the chapter, how we abstract while maintaining the, trust relationship for Switzerland and el Elbonia, anywhere Yeah, thanks a lot for all of this.

We do have networked that we're building with secure routing properties per hub link and create enrollment automatic for all the participant devices through a crypto chain. So if for the enrollment we simply add requirements for attestational will end up with a secure forwarding routing service with a lot of security properties that also has other properties like oh devices can only be in one country or from one vendor or with whatever other security properties and from there on out I think there are a lot of variations on how one could build, you know, similar principles NASA instances The two points, I think that would be beyond that self-promotion, sorry for that be I think helpful would be for once, it would be lovely for people to come up with the most simple use case scenario that they think they would want to get into NASA and then have those beaten up right I think they're for people to come up with the most simple use case scenario that they think they would want to get into NASA and then have those beaten up, right?

So as simple use case as possible when people think about them, please bring them up And the second one, and then I'm finished is I would just love to see, you know, NASA options that do not depend only on proof of transit, but that can also work without proof of transit.

I'm not saying this would be a typical NASDA deployment, but I was saying this is one, you know, possible instance. As the only implementer of 8994 to date, it would be appropriate for there yeah but I don't see it left right no one not yeah why why why why is it not a appropriate left right to have per hop link encryption? That's the best way to put but that's not an ACP that's per hop link encryption No, no, but the ACP itself does have per hop link encryption yes, yeah. And that's, that's all I was talking about. I just don't see it I don't see it's a helpful step for us here. No, wait a second. So I do very much think that per hop link encryption provides you with the most secure network services when you really want to ensure that you do also not have you know, at least a lot of observation of the non-desired transit, right? So I mean, yeah, so what I'm hearing, I think moving forward for the next steps is for us to clarify the dependencies and non right, or the gaps, I should say, because the other gap I was gonna to say was with Anima, you do talk about the trust and provisioning of certs, but he they're talking about defining the profile with a set of claims to get to what yeah that definitely ACP would be just one example possible profile you can build out of that right so"

Because one of the other things that ANMA does, which I think would be great for many NASA deployments, is that it nails down the real functionality you want to have and just not lists that some random features are being configured which is a much weaker attestation as to what you ultimately get out of it Wait. Go ahead Direct question for Turalis, but anima is definitely, or seems to be definitely limited domain Yeah, so when we originally implemented that for enterprise customers, the limit domain we're thinking about was a global bank with 150 that for enterprise customers, the limited domain we're thinking about was a global bank with 150,000 routers.
