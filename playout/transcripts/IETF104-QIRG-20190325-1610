    "text": "idea of what sort of things are where the where things are we have done some work on network architecture based on Joe touches recursive network architecture for those of you who know Joe the protocol stuff that we already talked about a little bit we\u0027ve done some work on routing we\u0027ve done some work on multiplexing and control in larger networks and we\u0027ve done some work on internet working this was part of shota\u0027s PhD thesis if we had two different kinds of networks how would we connect them together as as we go from individual networks toward toward an Internet and we\u0027ve done some work on the security of systems what happens when somebody actually takes control of one of these repeaters do they have more capabilities than they would have in a classical system we\u0027ve done some work on resource analysis for applications and we\u0027ve done some work on the quantum equivalent of network coding so that\u0027s sort of you know the range of things that that people have been working on for the last few years from Stephanie\u0027s group axel gave me that gave me this list of things they\u0027ve been working on link layer protocols and parameter regimes for dealing with this and how you actually go about using this for particular applications and and you know a bunch of different stuff they built some simulators for doing this that gives you a kind of an idea of you know the work that\u0027s actually going on and somebody has a question here real quick let\u0027s see how are we doing timewise it\u0027s 602 I need a couple of minutes at the end of things to finish up but we can do questions right now yes please you know have you done any tests in low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit we have not but actually we didn\u0027t include a slides from this but there\u0027s been a community of people working towards satellite based experiments forever for what no more than 10 years now and they\u0027ve done even some experiments in orbit saying hey maybe we could do some stuff with this and then bang two years ago of the team from China produced a really fantastic paper showing that they can generate two entangled photons in orbit and send them to earth and detect those two photons and prove that they had entanglement had two ground stations 1,200 kilometers apart was it in China something like that yeah I was kind of begging the question is the environment better in space that it is down here in a lot of ways yes so one of the most famous teleportation experiments you want to talk about the Tenerife really I guess more than hundred kilometers at any free space experiment yeah and I guess I would picture those as having separate applications that the the free space or satellite based experiments or satellite based encoding can get you over these really long distances right can get you global connections but I guess we can think about applications where the connections will be so local and not certainly the resources of satellites you\u0027re not gonna "
