During during this week, but if you haven't, please take a moment to to read and understand if have any question, please re in the chairs on anyone. Note really well. We are kind and respectful to each other. So please also, acknowledge this. This session is being recorded. Some meeting tips here. You probably also have seen this several times. Enough. Some resources links, for this session or it is meeting, And let's go with the agenda. So first of all, we're gonna have, around half an hour off introduction. Yeah, this this session is recorded. I already covered that. Not well. Please take a moment to log in to Mexico even if you're in the room so that you're able to get into the queue and your presence is recorded. Notetakers. We have Magnus. Thank you very much. There's gonna be a width overview instead of the area. Then we're gonna talk about the review teams and directorate and what's happening to those. I have added a pointer to a presentation that I made, to,"

And we're gonna have the the same equivalent presentation for marketing today about the transport hoops. That are now in width to to Yep. Martin, do you get the owner to do that? Because is the one of the last transport Yes. And then we're gonna have some open mic at the end. So, does anyone want to slash this agenda. Any changes to the agenda? If not, we can start So this is, a reminder of what happened This is a new area, web and internet transport for WIT. So in art, we had a number of working that were also security art and web art related, and this got split So the security related working groups went to security area, art working groups, state in art, and then there is web art that went to it. And in transport, there was some transport and other areas related working groups that got all split out, and, and we created width. And this is the list of working groups, that are now part of wit. RTC web has a star because, it is soon gonna close. They're concluding their work. So they're part of Witt, but they're staying with the responsibility Murray.

So we have 5 drops that are new to the RFC editor's queue And, also, we have 4 RC that have been published since IETF 118. I think I I captured all of them, but I might have missed any. So but congratulations to the working groups for these drafts and these RFCs. Like, I think there's also maybe frameworking and ABT core, which is marked as ABTX because it's ancient. So There was one that's been lingering since, like, 2017, which we finally finally finally got to the RFC editor. Okay. So that that went to the Yeah. So that could be on list there. Okay. Okay. 7 years of misref. So Okay. Yeah. I I didn't mark those that, change status in the RC editor that those are Yeah. Of course, of course, those are That's great too. Okay. This is, a short, slide of updates for the working groups. So first of all, I wanted to thank, chairs of the of the working groups who have provided some short update to their working groups in the wheat area mailing list. These updates are linked. From the name of the working groups here. So you can see those that have know, link, you can go in and check out check their update. Thank you very much. I think those were really helpful and and hopefully Well, there's agree with me, and we can continue this. And if you're working your pass and sent an update,"

So going quickly through this, AVT core will have an AD change. This will go to the head. We have one document that passed working group plus call, got some comments, and then the other documents are progressing. CDNI has 2 documents in working group plus call and is also discussing adoption on other documents. Core has 19 active drafts, and it it had a very packed agenda, this ATF meeting. A selected, documents are listed here was core confs, clustering resource identifiers, the updates for OSCORE and OSCORE cap capable proxies. HTTP API, has this authentication link draft, the past requested an early sector view, also 7 working group documents being updated and discussed on Friday. HTTP BIS, is progressing work. 9 working group documented are discussed. It at this IETF, but it's also a new, proposals such as HTP3 on on streams and reverse HTTP tunnels. And is also meeting tomorrow, I believe. Mock has an AD change. So this will also go to the head and a chair change. And has just adopted a catalog format draft to be posted soon. RTC web, as I said, has one document in 48. And after that, we'll conclude web trans is progressing. Documents are close to working group plus call.

So Now we have, CCW working group. That's the condition control working group. We had a very good discussion today. This is They're working on 50 33 biz, That's basically your guideline for defining, or testing or deploying Internet you're designing, control control for internet, what we should do. The the work is almost done. And then the next thing is to start the chart. Discussion on, like, is there any candidate condition control algorithm that should be published, and that needs a rechartering. So so this has started discussion that mask. I think they Only thing I add here is, like, connect Ethernet reach is, like, in progress. It's done. And so, basically, We had, good discussion on that one. We need to see, like, how it goes. It needs more like more more eyes on it, so to say. FSB 4, we have Wanna, document approved, one document sent back to the working group because or some, response, non response, I would say."

Let me be quick focusing slowly, but I could say, like, now we have made good decisions in these ITM 119. So it's good. Apps is closing soon. We have, document, one document, interface document When for the second last call, and this is really good now. I think we should progress. GPM, ACORDnesian waiting for write up, it won't go forward. SBWG. We had a a good discussion about AWS, DTS over HTTP. We need to make some decisions. Other SD is waiting on our decision what to do. But this needs some further investigation applied. Do you test some IPR open source issues? And then there was some discussion about media data, medium, media metadata sending to the network. So that's one thing, perhaps, need to actually talk with other working group may related to media to make some progress. So So that was it from the transport side, with tem. Okay. TSB, art review team. That's, the TSB used to have, we will keep it as it is in with the rear. The team is, is A good set of his parts that looks into your documents or our documents, and give some reviews. That's very valuable to us. Progressing the document.

And it's been created fairly recently in December 2022. And it has already done 16 reviews so far. 6 since IETF 118. So there is some triage that is done by Mark of IETF last call documents and he also, I think, scans for version 0 of documents to see if any of those need to be reviewed. And we want to really encourage early early reviews. So please ask ADs and chairs if you see that you your draft could benefit from a HTTP year review. Please go ahead and and request it. That's important so that we can catch any issue early and fix it hopefully. So thank you very much to the HTTP there. The reviewers and to mark Oh, and I should say that, yes. This is staying unchanged as it was in art. So, yeah, now soon you're gonna see a presentation by Martin of the transport working groups.

So yeah. So as as Franchesca hinted, like, my my goal right now is to kind of, introduce you to some of your new family. For those of you coming from the outside of the house, I'll give you quick elevator pitch about, Each of the working groups coming here from transport and, thanks to excellent planning on our parts. You cannot actually attending any of these meetings at at Brisbane because they're all done except for one, which I'll point out. But, you know, just for your information, you can start looking at documents, joining lists, and then a plan to attend in in Cooper, if interests you. Next slide, please. Sure. Thank you. Okay. The first is congestion for working group. There is a document called RSC 5333 that sets the standards for, standardizing congestive controls. It was written for a very different era in, and how congestion controls were developed and and and advanced and and and and and prepared for for this kind of thing. And the bottom line is TLDR. It's too hard to do this tried to standardize Cubic about a year ago, which has been the Linux default for, like, 15 years And it was very, very painful. So we said this is not how we should do this. So, the the first deliverable for CCWG was to, fix 5033 to update it, and that is just about done. We should be delivering that the AD. Hopefully in the next couple months. And then the hope for this is to, then progress it to Given this new framework for for standardized controls to actually start standardizing some pedestrian controls. One way in which the old way is obsolete is just that we had you know, various entities, hyperscalers, and other"

Deploying stuff globally without really a whole lot idea for you because the review process was so cumbersome, and I I think we're already seeing a lot of interest in that stuff actually coming home to the IETF and getting getting, you know, properly written up, which is, which has advantages for everybody. So they're they're different. I mean, what we'll see there's gonna be rechartering here pretty soon. See what exactly decide to adopt. You can see some candidates there. Maybe you could probably heard of BBR if you're at all adjacent to the space. And it also, like, it that group is certainly open for BCB is on a sort of general advice. We'll see what comes in that space and what people wanna do. Mask. There's some mask enthusiasts in there, I believe. So quick has, something in it called Datagram. So quick is basically speak service guarantees very at the very highest level. So it doesn't have unreliable things natively, but there's extension called Datograms, and that allows you to provide UDP, like, service guarantees to application traffic. And so the basic deal with mask is you're taking HP connect, which most of you probably familiar with, and extend it beyond TCP to carry other things, mostly in data So UDP, which is done, and by extension quick over UDP. IP, which is done the listen side of UDP, which is not done, quick, but skipping some of the overhead of actually explicitly having UDP And, finally, and most recently, and hot off the presses ethernet. So, many people like to joke that we're then gonna go and do, like, 5 g and in carrier pigeon and whatever else over HTTP connect. I hope I'm not giving up the plot. But, in theory, this is one day gonna end once we've once we've done everything we need to Okay. So so, why, just some use cases for this? 1 is, privacy proxy. See where, have a client connecting to Target and it wants to obscure, it's its identity."

And then all the, Then there's an ultimate quick connect or quick or other UDP connection to a target that is carried, encrypted in the tunnel to the proxy and the proxy kind of captulates that and passes it on to the target. A second use case is performance enhancing proxies. In the transport area, we need to see performance and vaccine proxies. You will get a fairly diverse set of opinions and epithets. But, in the TCP world, you split it can very easily put a connection because no way authenticated and for relevant various extreme link technologies like satellite or certain mobile use cases these are somewhat popular because you can run a very special congestion control for that very special link type and then do something more normal for the the connection over the wider internet. Can't really do that in quick because quick is an authenticated transport. But using mask if the client explicitly consents to do it. It could connect to the to the mask proxy. That outer connection can run a very special congestion control and then the inner encapsulated thing would be, ready for the normal internet. And then finally VPN, which, I mean, we all know VPNs are. Basically, you can have to mask proxies on either end of of, the open internet and then have a private corporate network or whatever. With a bunch of hosts, and they just use this proxy to to to, to tunnel stuff over the internet. That didn't work. Go ahead. Did I break it? No. No. No. Okay. I've been breaking a lot of these. Okay.

So they maintained that and remote direct memory access or RDMA, this has this is a pretty insular group that's been doing their thing for a long, long time. They're currently refreshing, 4.1. They're doing some intern internationalization stuff and, doing RBC over RDMA. Ask, I had a few more questions about that because I don't know. Quick. I think you've heard of this. It's new. Doesn't really apply anymore. Reliable transport. I already talked about it a little bit. These are the the TLDR, there's like the 5 things. I would say these are the 5 reasons we did it. And replaced TCP and SCTP. I'll note extensibility because that's that's like the IETF thing. TCP runs into the very serious problem because all these little boxes and all the things that are not encrypted and invisible to the network that there's a lot of enforcement that tries to be helpful that is not actually helpful, makes it very, very difficult to innovate. And so, from an IETF perspective, one of the most exciting things is the stability of quick. It's all encrypted envelope. Almost all of it. And so it's very easy to add new features and and new do new innovative things. Okay. So what so that quick has been done for a while. What's new? They're currently working on standardized logging formats. I I I think we all know what t speed dump is. There were there's a large ecosystem of tools based on using packet captures to analyze things like congestion controls that kind of this, the congestion control nerds can these graphs and understand what's happening. That's it's much harder, of course, with encrypted packet. So, this logging format called Q log creates a as sounds like a common format to record events and so on, and then there's they're building an ecosystem of tools around that to visualize connections to understand what's happening. And by the way, that's not just a quick thing. This the generalized format could be applied to other. Protocols including HP 3, which is being worked on in the quick group right now, or the"

    "text": "logging format for it, rather. And, we're starting to see a little bit of other working groups start to build a key log, formats for their protocols much as you might do for like yang or something. It doesn't all happen to happen. It doesn't all have to happen in quick. Just the normal, like, protocol performance tweaks that you'll do anywhere. Another big thing going multipath, and there's a little picture of multipath on the right. Multi path is a weird term, which means different things in different contexts. It used to mean having failover where you have a second path And when the first path goes south, you switch to that one, quick is how that from the beginning. It's called address migration. The other meaning multi path is I'm actually sending paths or traffic concurrently on multiple paths in bulk that sounds very appealing. It is much trickier than than it sounds. To do correctly. And, that is something that that this this work group is working on. Okay. Taps, as I think someone said is is about to close, but the basic idea here is that, you know, in the old days, we had, like, deposits API, and that was great for doing transport stuff. But now, well, you always had a DNS do DNS resolution separately at the in the application, call direct application. That was not great. And now the idea of a transport substrate is a little bit broader. I mean, I think most Hopefully, a lot of things cover TLS instead of go over directly over the socket. At the risk of mark notting him, shooting me the rifle from over there. Like, HTTP is often effectively a transport. For a lot of things. And so the and, like, 11 and a lot of this thing's happening space. So when you're building applications on top of these other other, like, upper layer algorithms, you end up having to marry that algorithm. Like, you might you know, implement it to run on top of OpenSSL and, you know, you better hope to open of those what you want to do in terms of supporting the features.

And that should be closing soon. Alright. I already talked about the slide, so I'm gonna Alright. TCVM, I think we all know what TCP is and what TCP maintenance means, as I mentioned earlier, extensions are hard because TCP is unprotected. They're still working on some performance tweaks, like, one they're really annoying legacy things about TCP. Like, can have only 40 bytes of options now that we have things crypted cookies in in options that's not really big enough. And then lastly, the tail end of l l for our support, which I'll talk about, in a moment. Okay. All for us. So this is something that, the core documents for this were published in TSBWG, a Okay. I think a year ago or so. This is a this is the latest flavor of explicit congestion notification, but the basic idea here is that you have, if you use a certain bit in the IP header, you go into a different queue with a much shallower buffer. And, the ECN mark is interpreted differently than it that was in the past to say just back off a little bit rather than a lot. And that allows you to sort of fine tune a connection to to operate very low key occupancy, and you should get much, much lower latency across across the, the path. This is already getting you know, this is this is starting to get some legs. TCPM work here is to is to report the marks. If you have more rich reporting of the received marks, back to the sender, which requires new CSP ops and so on, and that work is not quite done, even though a lot of the L4S stuff is done and,"

One thing they the air force their air force stuff is almost done, but they are responsible for SCTP. Which is a a quite old protocol at this point. They're not as old as TCP. It really doesn't get through middle boxes for the reasons that middle boxes do their thing. It has 2 use cases that are pretty prevalent. Number 1, it is the data channel for for WebRTC when it's put over DTLS. And of course, DTLS solves the problem that that middle box is block a protocol number. It is also used in the service provider signaling network. Which, of course, don't have some middle box issues that that other places do. So, you know, like, some people sometimes ask me, like, we have quick now. Why is STTP still around? Well, that that's why. It may be that that that WebRTC and other other media options like evolve past this. It may eventually Was it going from 5 g to 6 g or some other g? Like, maybe this little this will fall off the table, but as it is, it's still it's still still very much out there in the internet. And right now, there's actually the there's an authorization chunk in and it is broken. So we're fixing it. It seemed pretty important. And then, there's there's some other, like, a performance authorization allows you to check someone. There's other integrity action. And then finally, details over SCTP, which is not, which is the opposite of STT over DTLS, and that is used in, in service provider. Works, And then, again, TSEWG is kind of the grab bag for transports that don't, that I don't have enough traffic to do a, have their own working group anymore. UDP is pretty simple. So it it also fits in that category. There's a quite intriguing option that is maybe a little bit that some people might say is too clever. Called UDP options because there's a UDP header field, you header link, a UDP Payload link field and an IP link field, which are kind of redundant. If they're different, you could put some stuff in there, and that's what that's doing."
