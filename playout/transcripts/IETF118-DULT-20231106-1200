Alright. The session is being recorded, by the way. So, kind of an FYI. This early in the week, so you may not have seen this. This is the note well. You know, this covers a lot of things primarily things like IPR, if you if you get know, contributing and you know something. You gotta say something you need to disclose. A bunch of other things in there about code of conduct and the light. Comparates and working group processes, etcetera. If you have any questions, you can ask us or area direct. Some additional things for some meetings tips. Again, use the the meeting tool. There's a link in the agenda. You can get to the meeting tool if you want. If you wanna do the full blown video, you can do that as well. We'll be doing the slides so that the presenters don't have to worry about that. All good. Yeah, please make sure you turn your video off unless you're sharing. Zach, I think we're we're maybe gonna make an exception for you, here's the agenda. We got a note taker. Thank you very much. Jonathan? Appreciate that very much. I'm Sean? I'm Alyssa. And, yes, the plan is at theend for the studio working group performing both. Just last time it wasn't.

But we'll do that if we need to. And then at the end, we'll have a bunch of thought questions where we through our typical homes. So without further ado, The both goals. Yeah. Sure. So, just drawing from our traditional above guidelines. The point of the BAF is to demonstrate that we have community agreement about a few things. First is that there's a problem that needs solving and the IETF right place. To do the the solving. But there's a critical mass of participants willing to work on the problem, so we will be asking about this at the end. We had a lot of interest last time, but, you know, it's been a few months, so we'll check-in again. The scope of the problem is well defined and understood and that people generally understand what the working group will work on. We're gonna spend I think a lot of time talking about that today. There's agreement about specific deliverables, which we'll also talk about, and it's believe that the working group has a reasonable probability of having us, Like, we don't wanna charter working group if we think that we're not actually gonna be able produce the deliverables that we agreed to.

One of the more material changes, I think, since the last time we all talked, and due to the feedback from everybody was what particular pieces here are actually inscope for the potential solution. So left hand side is the the architecture right hand side is I'd pairing up of that to what is actually in scope. Of the new changes is actually on number 1 itself enrolling in tracking network. One of the main updates that we've made is ensuring that that the aspect of actually enrolling in the system, and I think in particular, what trackers are doing to, validate they're actually correctly implementing the the protocol is one of the main new pieces that is in scope now. So I think in particular, the goal here is for trackers that correctly implement the protocol, but they can actively participate the network. And for those that have not have some verification that, they haven't and be able to exclude them from participating in the network. Together reached over to to, which is in the, from the red tracker down to the green box, none other device. President's podcasting has wasn't scope, continues to be in I think here, the pieces are things like, how a tracker advertises, what it advertises, the frequency with which it advertises, all kinds of things like that. Totally very, totally in scope. 3 is in the bottom left hand corner determining unwanted tracking. I think this is probably the main bit that we are calling out of scope at the moment for for this particular working group website proposed working group. Which is, how does the system actually do the determination of when and when a tracking is happening I think the goal is to have the the signal be all of the pieces in effect that are the rest of the system diagram, but"

I think the requirements of what should be in there and how they are all totally reasonable here. 6 is actually disabling are are getting disable instructions, obviously a critical piece of if you've been tracked on on without your knowledge or consent, getting the information say critical piece here. And 7, a similar set of things, which is how should we actually interface to get information about the owner itself. So I think this regard, we've we've think historically imagine this to be some redacted set of own information, not obviously identifying the owner. I think there are lots of privacy and security considerations that will go into what is the appropriate solution look like for or kind of 6 and 7. I think the last couple bits one of the other newer changes was providing some guidance or some some physical security considerations, which I think was based on feedback from the last boss. To figure out what how do you particularly identify trackers that have either been modified in some way to make them harder to find, or either, you know, we thought about you know, the the the attack vector, like, wrapping something in duct tape or something like that.

I think it's really useful that we think about this entire system, and it is complicated. Just put this in the chat. But the title of this boss. Is the one thing that is marked not in scope. I have a I I'm worried about that. Can can you can you talk a little bit about why the title of the BAF is the one thing that's not in scope? Yeah. I think the the totally reasonable question. I think the way that we've hoped that this would work is that the actual detection itself is kind of dictated by all of the inputs, these pieces, like, all of All of the other pieces are the critical aspects of doing the detection itself. But the detection I would say the detection system itself probably has some, platform specific nuances that I think make it potentially more challenging to dictate exactly how that works.

But I don't know I don't know how to think about kind of threading the needle between kind of fully specking out every aspect of the the the manner in which unlimited tracking is occurring and figuring out how to kind of scope in all of the right inputs at the same time. I mean, I I don't think we should bring in scope, like, what color should the alert be in the gooey. Right? I mean, I I I get that. But if we don't actually think about how we are going to detect unwanted tracking with this protocol. Then we're missing the boat. I think that means 2 things. It means 1, we need to think about when the user is going to become aware of this thing And and what kind of parameters we should be talking about, and we need to think clearly, about the false positives false positives are a serious risk for this system. Right? If we set this up, that it gives you a warning every time there's an unwanted tracker. Success, but it also gives you a warning every time there isn't an unwanted tracker. They will not be useful. So we really do need to think about The point the name of the working group, which is the one thing that's marked not in scope here. I it's a mistake to to to to to to just say, well, we're gonna give you all the pieces put it together yourself. Can can you come back for one second? So you would find a lot more value if there was a standardized definition of what it means for the tracker to be unwanted, because I think what I hear him saying is that it's possible that having a diversity of the in that definition could be useful. Like, maybe Android thinks of it one way and and iOS thinks of it a different way and, like, perhaps that's there's some utility in that, but I think I just wanna probe on whether you think there's really only one definition of, like, does it mean for the tracker to be unwanted and we should just standardize it?

We're giving you some signals and you can figure out yourself how to do that, I'm not convinced that we've solved any problems here. Maybe we've introduced problems. And if the goal of this is detecting unwanted tracking, we should have at least some guidance that says you know, You have a Bluetooth device that where, you know, you've noticed enough of the president's broadcasts that are in detached mode. If this is what we're doing, that you don't you don't recognize because you're keeping a database of devices that you've you know, that you've allowed you know, We we need to think about what the user's experience is going to be. If this protocol is gonna work, We need to be able to tell people that that Here's how you defend yourself. From unwanted tracker. And I don't think that we can leave that up to I mean, what if I wanna make a device that's gonna do that's gonna do this detection. What does the device need to do? Like, how can how can we propose all stuff and not talk about what that device needs to do. Mean, I don't know that there's one specific standard, but we need to talk about like, the range of things that are reasonable to do, right? Like, do you have a do you have a an allow list for presences that you're willing to remove from, you know, that you're willing to ignore, or do you say it has to be visible for a range of time, and here's here's what we think the reasonable time ranges are.

But the sec, 100%, but that's not a 100% agree with you that we should be best at justifying a mechanism. This thing is out of scope. And I actually have a suggestion for what we have to do, which I think is a little more you've suggested, which is I think we ought to define a set of algorithms, which if you implemented them, would do a reasonable job in our opinion of detecting online tracking. And we are president for this. If you look at what quick does, for instance, right, quick comes to the congestion control. Gustion controller, which you can do not have to implement. You can put your request controller, But, like, if you go in your read the book documents and you just read for your full attention quick, you can say it's okay. And so I think similarly here, we should drill something where if you read these documents, and you do the thing, it says in this document, you get something that kinda mostly works. I think more than guidance, I think we actually provide an algorithm then, like, people are free to innovate, but it would mostly work if you did So that I think that there's 2 things where I would suggest. Rowan is next. Hi. Rowan Mae. So I came up to talk about the the false positives, so the first case that I was thinking of is if I'm a thief and I don't want the thing that I just saw to be tracked. And then the second one second use case is you know, I my, you know, my kid, it rides rides on the, you know, the bus to school, say, and they're sitting next to somebody else.

And what I was originally gonna say here is It feels like this should be in scope, but essentially, even potentially more than just like an example algorithm, And an an actual algorithm here, with you know, the pieces that you can fill in or extend with local policy and heuristics. And Pay. Yeah. As another example in This is a totally mundane example, but working on happy eyeballs implementations where we say, okay. You know, we're racing connections here's this algorithm, but there's all of these different variable values that depending on local policy you could have or you have these other heuristics or historical information, like, you know, maybe one, your client OS will say, oh, I've, like, the user already marked this thing is something that they know about, and they don't wanna be bothered about it again.

Or children that can be kidnapped and with, making things like easy disable disablement of the devices is in, discovering computer devices, I'm wondering if we're not giving a very easy tool for bad actors, to, find the devices because for them, their unwanted tracker devices. I have no idea how to solve this problem. I'm just trying to stick into the spokes on the screen. Zach, do you want to talk about that? Yeah. I think, I think we had some discussion about this in the, in the last buff, and I think the if I recall correctly, some of that conversation was around I think in effect, like, people taking priority over solen property. I think that that's it's a hard line to draw. And I know it's it's a a weird thing to talk about and some aspects, but, I think the protections of of ensuring that people are not tracked without their knowledge or consent is probably more important than ensuring that, you know, still still in items are not notified I know that that's tricky, but I think if I remember correctly, that was a conversation with, put Evolast around.

So I I don't think it's probably helpful to drill down into, like, the relative priorities of, like, the of of the equities here. But, I think it should be clearly the case. I think it's clearly the case if it's, like, not possible We don't know how to build a system. That, that allows you to detect when you're being tracked and you don't want it, but there's not a lot of people who still want your stuff being attracted. They don't want it.

And so, you know, I think my my impression is, that like and I I don't need to admit this argument, but, like, did did you know, like it or not for the people who want to check with their stuff is being stolen. The manufacturers have made a decision that they wanna make it possible to step in their when the when the when you're being dragged so there's gonna be a system for that no matter what so with the choice of whether it can be centralized or not a standardized system, but we do not get to choose whether it's gonna be anti anti on what a tracking counter measures in these systems because they're gonna get And if someone wants to go build a tracking system, which does not have those kind of measures. Like, I get to the protocol, at least, you can't stop them. They won't use it for any theft.

The like, the right to be informed that something is something appears to be tracking you is a maybe a more fundamental or more, easily achieved or both, or both, property, then then being able to work out whether you have a legitimate right to be able to disable somebody else's tracker that may just happen to be followed, you know, maybe happen to be walked along the same route or on the same bus or subway.

So of since looking at the email group and looking at the video and notes from the last BAF meeting, filed about 25 issues on GitHub. To track all the the feedback. Some of those turned out to be duplicates are related. I think there were upper teens, maybe 20 PRs that we pulled together. To address that specific feedback. We made our best attempt to take all the feedback and incorporate into the charter. I don't think we admitted anything. So, hopefully, we have a much better charter. Then we had 3 months ago. So summary, the high level summary, the changes we made in the work to go through the the actual language in the charter as an overview and then get into coffee, real time editing. So as Zach mentioned, they told BT advertisements in scope that was feedback from the last time. As is the MSC payload, the privacy and security requirements and considerations for the unwanted track of the crowdsourced network. Sorry. The finding network are in scope. Conformant trackers are in scope. Physical security security considerations, as Zach mentioned too, are in scope. Considerations for people without a device, capable of detecting unwanted tracking or in scope, of course, we fixed minor typos and clarifications. And then Apple did submit updated IPRs. There was feedback about the IPR disclosures last soft meeting, being too restrictive. So we we submitted those back in October 12th of 2023. Let's go to the next slide please.

So I don't really see, I don't see why that means, like, we can't do a full specification of a wire format. The the relevant factors here is it is not possible to do security analysis of the system without having a complete description of what appears in the wire. And that inevitably means building something which is, like, more or less interoperable, even if you don't even even if you don't in fact, interoperate.

And maybe you have a specify, a special source algorithm that texts that use those signals as term when tracking is, is happening, and I probably find that secret.

So, again, bold italicized or new, there was a question. So I'll just summarize these quickly application. There was a question about which level protocol are we specifying? So try to clarify that. The sentence, this protocol is intended to protect people against unknowingly being tracked. The intent of this working group is to make it easier for arbitrary device detect unwanted tracking by these accessories to an attempt to focus on the use case. The next sentence, the working group will define privacy properties of its solution, including privacy and security protections for tag owners when tags are used Appropriperately and evaluate the trade offs, those were both based on feedback of making sure we're protecting legitimate use by the tag owner. And, making sure we're covering all privacy and security properties of the overall solution so that we know the efficacy of it Next slide, please. A little bit smaller font here.

And Bluetooth, message, pow passing also considers HTTP, protocols that that is in scope trying to clarify that. With the text here.

The the opaque blob and then owners of accessories. And then work item 2. We added the physical consider, security considerations. I think had it as a maybe. We debate if we really wanna do that. I think it's a good idea to have in scope, but it does kind of broaden the scope of this, working group somewhat. And then the last bulleted sentence there include considerations for protecting people. Don't have a device capable of running a platform based unwanted tracking detection system. So if you don't have a phone cable running at What can we do? How can we best protect you? That's in scope. Next slide, please. Getting to the item 4 was added to get to the point of just making sure whatever solution the working group comes up with, we understand how while it works. Holding ourselves accountable. Item 5 was deciding mechanisms to ensure that device do not correctly implement or adhere to the dull protocol can be detected and excluded from, being trackable via the crowdsourced networks. That's the nonconformant feedback that we was a robust discussion in the last Boston or email group. Over the email group on that. So that's in scope.

And secondly, in this particular case, I think I would argue that some evidence to back that up based on implementations and trials and so on.

Where where could you imagine the evidence would come from?

I think it can be extremely valuable to get, feedback from people who are providing services on the grounds to people who are being tracked to to describe both their, sort of use cases and and needs upfront the the on the requirement side and the actual impact it is or isn't having for the harms on the, on the deployment side.

Like, Like, do you like, does the network have to somehow detect if a device is you know, can't be opted into this protocol and then just say, just disable it? Is that the conceptually the idea. Disable it or prevent, location updates from it somehow notify the owner or the the company that excuse me, operates in network. There's there's a number of ideas that have been floated, and I think people have some very specific ideas. I I think, again, the real point here was The last BAF had also over the email group. People wanna make sure the working group can discuss this and figure out which are the different options are. Are feasible Cool. Thanks. Yeah. Cool. Thanks. So I have a couple of thoughts just as an individual. The first one is on the privacy and security language. So there's now, like, 2 new places, where this is discussed, which is good. But I was just curious about, it could go a little further because there's been enough examples where something along these lines was said in a charter, and then it's like, privacy considerations are that we don't consider it. Right? So, I I'm curious if you think it's possible to have a sort of affirmative requirement that, like, what gets specified here will not be used as additional track. Cannot could not be used as additional tracking vectors. Based on the information that's that's exchanged in the in the various interfaces."

As soon as possible? Okay. Yeah. And then my other just note, which could be useful in the part, in the new part about phones and tablets. Some of the other IoT groups, I know in the past, the charters have specified like, the the dimensions of the device or the capabilities of the set of device is that some power or whatever. It gives, like, a range. So that's something that you could think about adding here. As a more precise way of saying what's in scope versus out of scope because, like, inevitably, someone will put a device on a market, which is somewhere between a watch and a tag, and then you'll have to say, like, is this in scope or not? And it's just easier to say, like, something that is more descriptive of what the set of devices are that you wanna be in Yeah. Good for you back. Roman. Hi, Roman engineers, AD. I'm wondering if that, Steven, I can put you back on the spot to come, kinda, clarify your feedback, because I've I've heard you say it twice and it seems really important. So how does one demonstrate that evidence? And I know other working groups have know, have a, have a working culture of, you know, we're gonna do interop. We're gonna kind of do implementation where we feel. I haven't seen that written into charter language, though. So can you tell me a little bit about what what you mean and kind of what's different beyond, like, I'm sorry. In in terms of is it you saying that this should be the specification design philosophy or you're saying we need something hard because if, to me, if we say something hard in the chartering language, and now I'm gonna be put in the position you know, if this were to be charted later on and say, well, did we meet the experiment or not?

And, but nonetheless, it was a thing that happened. And it turns out, you know, at least in my opinion, that the whole lot of the claims made for that system were not true. You know, it it may have had some impact. It may have had it may have been better to do something utterly different, like, just randomly telling people to go get a test or something. And part of that was when we, you know, when we were able to test the system. It turned out that there was lots of ways in which, you know, it was it was more or less in picking up the various Bluetooth beacons. It was more or less at random in certain environments, like within within within trains where you're surrounded by metal. The thing just didn't really work. And so what I'm saying is that If we're talking about a system like this, where there's potentially bad downsides, Knowing that, I don't know, having some evidence and what that evidence is would depend on we actually develop. But having some evidence that it actually has an impact and reduces the harms, before we kind of standardized it, I think it's kind of called for Just a point of clarification by by standardization, you mean, like, publishing RFC with a number on it. Yeah. So this is kind of like a like, implement, like, write this back, actually get some implementation experience before you say you're done. Right. But the implementation experience is not only to to you know, which I think what's different here is normally the implementation experience does it interrupt and do people wanna Right? Here, it's also doesn't really reduce the harms. Which I think is slightly different thing than we would normally So so if I So if I maybe restate this kind of again, in other working groups when we publish RFCs, when sometimes do interrupt. Sometimes we publish without knowing whether it's actually gonna do kind of any good.

So, therefore, do we actually succeed in mitigating the harms? Seems like there's a lot of things. Now, how you actually make tests with us, how you would, you know, have the working group reach consensus that, yeah, we pass some kind of bar. I think that's fair enough for the work you have to figure out, but think requiring the working group to do that seems like a fundamental part of the problem here. As opposed to trust, just trying to make something go faster or or get to talk to each other. Maggie, Hi. Yeah, so I just wanted to one what Nick had said earlier about, involving people who might not be able to directly contribute to the working group or the standards. I've been working with a couple different, tech abuse advocacy organizations. And I think the big feedback that we got when we tried to share the draft of the standard was we have no idea what's going on with and we feel really excluded, but we feel like there's an opportunity for them contribute. So I think it's really great if you can try to find a way to work with these people. I think there's a lot of different ways to do that. And I think basically just makes sense for the working group charters to just say that that's going to happen. And I think a lot of the details can be worked out after the fact, and I'm happy to help us out if I can. Daniel Gilmore, Gilmore.

At all times, and it needs to be on at all times, or you won't be able to detect these trackers. Then we are in some sense increasing the value of malware on the user's own device. And I don't know how to navigate that tension. But, you know, if I'm talking to someone who's concerned about tracking, one of the things I will say to them is Does your partner have access or your stalker have access to your device? And often the answer could be yes. And, I see. Well, you should try leaving your device at home. You should turn it off. You know, when you're going someplace that you're worried about.

Where my mind at least goes on that, is that, I mean, there are other complimentary, efforts we need to do in the overall ecosystem that are a little bit orthogonal to this, but I think can help it. For example, at least, you know, within iOS, because that's what I'm thinking about here. Like, we have modes like, safety check. Mode that are dedicated and mock demo. Like, there are there are modes that are meant to be like, Hey, I'm trying to get out of an abusive situation. I'm trying to stop tracking, and it is turning off lots of things that would otherwise be used for tracking and, you know, Separately from this effort, you know, we can talk about how effective those are and how we can make even better and better over time.

Last week, I had a conversation with an organization that's literally testing out all of the different tracking devices, so that they can learn more about it, how it's working what the distance is. So there are groups actively working in intersection. So it would be really wonderful if we can bring them to the table because I'm sure that they have a lot to say. In particular, when we talk about, know, I think somebody brought up a good point. About how, okay. Well, what about if the perpetrator demands that you keep this on you and and and is active. And if not, that would result in harm. I mean, that goes the same apps that goes the same for tablets for for many different things. So to say that it's good or bad to to have that is is oversimplifying a very complex issue that ultimately needs to be centered on the survivor and a survivor needs. So understanding it a lot more holistically, joining with the gender based violence for fonts providers and making sure that whatever we do is actually substantially consistent and involved with that. And is going to be important if we really are looking at, victims and survivors intimate partner violence. The last piece that I wanted to say is on the data piece. And, you know, proving, a harm that doesn't there is always difficult as a field, it's very difficult. We do have ways of measuring"

And I wouldn't have to implement device access station could just stick a key on that. Right? That's how I want to do it. It it's dumb, but like, I could. I do think the client authentication is really important because otherwise what's going to happen is 2. I'm good. Someone's gonna say, oh, I figured out that if I just send this fixed byte string, I can use Apple's tracking network. No difficulties. And that that's bad.

You you just set, like, a user agent and can be a public string, and that's totally fine. Like, you if you don't specify what your actual property is, someone can interpret that be stupid.

I think that item 5, as shown, is sufficient, and we do not need to change Okay. Dina. Hi. This is Dina. So I think the charter should have something much stronger to send a very clear message to the vendors. My back Macbook shouldn't be tracked. My phone shouldn't be tracked. I just bought some beats last week, Beats earphones. And on and I just find my while I was sitting here And it they're being tracked. If I buy an air tag, sole feature is the track. But all these other devices shouldn't be tracked at all. So I think the IETF or this charter should say by default, everything that Apple and Google ships should not be tracked. It should be turned off. You know what I tried doing while I was listening to everybody? I tried turning off my watch not to be tracked. By the way, it's saying Find My right now is saying this is five thousand miles away from me. Okay. So the software is buggy like crazy anyways. so misleading. It's so hard to turn off. I think the IETF should mandate this. And so you say if the IETF mandates this what makes the vendors wanna listen to them? Well, the vendors have coming here wanting"

AppleCare is about a lot. They're should be very easy to turn off the Findite features for the devices you talked about. So, I feel like we've sort of like, like, lost the thread here on point 5. The question is, like, what is gonna be necessary in order to achieve this and I think Ecker is right. Also think Jonathan is right. Something like, okay. So we might argue about what the definition is. But there's gonna there might be something like, identifiable about the tags that that is intrinsic to achieving this goal. Is is is a possibility. I'm not saying it's inevitable. We don't want to make the crypto too fancy if crypto is the solution for this. Anyway, I think we need this is another, I guess, this is another plus one to something that Edgar mentioned before. We we probably need to know something about what Apple and Google are doing. Like, how they how they, like, how they identify devices if they identify them, presumably they do. We shouldn't because like, a goal of the charter right now is don't privacy work, which I think is we, we can agree on, but I think we're already in a situation where privacy might be worse than we expect right now. And we should clarify that. I don't know if I'm making sense. It's just these things may may not be in conflict with one another. K. Tommy,"

Some of the comments that I'd I'd like to keep it more at this scope rather than saying you should do client authentication, but I wonder, Jonathan, When, when you explained why you want a client authentication, which I like. And I think maybe authentication or some other spelling thereof. Is the right thing. Can we can can we define a modification to the sentence that that just describes the property that you want out of it? Like, what is the guarantee? And just say what guarantee you want rather than seeing the mechanism because let's debate working Right. So the the property I want is authentication. Of the client. And the client in this case is the tag. If you wanna say tag authentication, fine. Like, I don't care if it's certificates. I don't care if it The the security property I want is that that I non authorized tracker, can access a different tracking. Cannot sorry. A tracker can access tracking network. It is not authorized it for. That's what we can we can we just put that in there. Just, like, Design the back. I mean, I think it's close, but, like, if we just I don't know, go back to the recording and write that down. Like, that's what I want in there, not Like, let's debate in the working group. How we instantiate that property it may be exactly what you're saying. But that's the job of the working group, not the job to turn Yeah. Okay. So I'm I am totally happy with a we define the authentication property that we want. But, like, yeah, it needs to be that I can't join a tracking network, if the tracking network doesn't know who I am or doesn't want me to join. Yep. That makes sense. So If we zoom out just a little bit,"

And you're saying that as long as the tracking networks can eject the things that we don't want that's good enough. But it's not good enough because they they might be confused about that. If we do client authentication, and they agree that you can use your key on your Random little fob. And then your fob and wouldn't be you implementing it, but somebody else might implement it where the key would leak. And now the key could be used on all the other devices, which don't actually implement design. So what we want is this, whether we can get this, I don't know. What we want is we wanna say the tracking network should refuse a tracker that doesn't implement this. Whether or not it's authorized is not the same thing. This is the goal. What you're offering might be a way that we can get on the way to the goal, but this should be the goal. I have a different topic. You can continue with the same. Right. So I I I mean, basically, I've got to say what DKG was gonna say. The, you know, the the The property we are trying to enforce is compliance with the protocol, not exclusion of of of other instructors. Now, as has been, I think, some, I think, was, the patent is ethically privately, like, of course, manufacturers actually probably do wanna exclude trackers that that are authorized And that's, like, not a not a goal bar to stop that from happening. But that's not that's not the point at this part of the exercise. So, the point is I I think the point is so I think as as to keep it, it says, like, not sufficient because you could make a device up so, I mean, it's they they give you, like, a concrete example. Right? Say you had a client authentication system. Where the devices signed things, but then there was, like, a payload that wasn't part of And and that was the part used for tracking. Right? And so, like, what I do is I buy 1 of those devices And, like, I capture all submissions, and then I just stop on the pet tracking code at the end as that cover you actually need to have like a"

But I see a lot of work for manufacturers of the trackers, and not many benefits for them. Are there any ways that we can convince them to implement these things. Other than legislation, legal requirements. So I think as Apple and Google are both the proponents of this BAF. We're very motivated to make sure trackers that work on our networks. Are implement this. Think there was express, support for this from a number of other companies in including tile and Samsung. Back when there's a press release from Google and Apple on the the work we were doing here. So there is support. You're asking for how to go to the next step to further motivate them beyond their There are there are no protocol police still. So, you know, there there's some there's I think there would be some desire to follow along with the larger companies and then maybe legislation comes along, but that's not our problem. Go ahead, Nick. Yeah. I I think I was gonna just, say I think, like, having the height of a language about designing, mechanisms, is useful because I really don't think we should over constrain it at this stage. Like, it it already exists the case that there are sort of customized devices that are tampered with or are are designed like, use other mechanisms for for tracking. Those are known threats.

So We wanna create a specification that works, but not one that specifies a lot of other stuff that they that is unnecessary for them to change in their finder network. That. Yeah. And I think there's language into Charter acknowledging Now I did not already. Chris. So I'm pretty well convinced. One but this so this this really covers well the case of, like, legacy devices. What about devices built up after the fact? Like, what about device? Like, I guess Apple and Google are also motivated to not let any old device use their tracking network. So So is your concern So someone builds a so someone do bill builds a device that that looks like it's act like participating in this protocol properly, but is not.

I don't really see a problem with having the the general there's always the general at the end of a charter that says who you're gonna work with.
