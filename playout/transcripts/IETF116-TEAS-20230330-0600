Your fin is network framework dropped, it will see that networks, resource partition, can provide some, like, resource petition. From the network. And so that the ip policy draft and an young module which... The two drops try to defend that define the different function of an ip attributes, but sometimes they use similar set of constructs.

On the right, you can see that this an module has three parts that three major parts. The first is an nation. The second is an monitoring and The third one is device. But our Decision is that we first touch about the Nr installation of monitoring that belongs to a network model and when these two has been stable, we will direct some attributes from this two and then we will reuse in the An device stephanie And For An asian definition, that this part we major borrowed from the An policy module and we augment with additional attributes for Ig and also another options of direct top option rather than the field"

So so either we add a top It. And also we add for example, the explicit path for each of the connections within the network slides to show how the connection is routed over the the customize of the top that's what we originally suggest and after the after the side the meeting.

So we are arguing whether the reference is from the S to the T or it's rather the other way around. That there is reference from the termination point to the S. Because it's possible that we could have multiple customize the top for for each of the connect for different connectivity constructs within an slice. Example employees is you have could have one connectivity constructs that's optimized for for for Delay and yet the other connectivity constructs that's optimized for bandwidth. So they could use different for this And also a related question is whether an S exist before Lt termination point is created So I think a we can discuss this and resolve it offline.

In fact, two documents. One was the plug that's are gonna be discussed later. And the service assurance next slide, please. So I believe next slide that Liu sort of raised a question earlier. So let let's let's try to address that immediately, which is why didn't we just talk about the service assurance requirements and potential architecture interfaces and models that may be applicable within the Po document itself, the one that it's arlo was talking about earlier. Well actually, it's it it it's probably going to be much more complex than we originally painted and therefore we didn't want to delay the previous document and take something which would not just typically fit in a subs section or even a main section and just try to sort of cram it in that document because when when we started scoping this piece of work and actually it potentially imports a framework from the ops area, so there's a service assurance framework."

So you're lou so far from what I've just said, does that answer the question? We no. Thanks. Even if the additions are complex, it's much clean... It's much easier from a process standpoint to have one document that is the delayed a little bit than two documents that spend a lot of time in the group. Mh. So we you know really need to see the text. One of the things that personally I didn't like but I started reading it is as I saw duplicate... A lot of duplicated text.

So again, there may have been some duplication there. That's just sort of laziness on our pot, so we can make sure that that is a.

This this document will be a really useful piece of work to show the reuse of existing work. Ideally, that's Published as an Rf or at least a very stable and mature working group document. But we have seen this week already that there are a few elements that would support service assurance that are very immature in the Ihs. So you delay may be relative in this case but we're not looking at potential months, especially as there's a new working we're being formed and looking at the milestones and the and the charter it it could be several months.

You'll get the equivalent of a sort of service activations difficult or birth certificate for the service to place your some discussion from Victoria. Earlier and and ensuring that you're proactively monitoring that connection then in the event of some catastrophic failure, you're having to switch over or and then restore the service and then look at inventory management and then handle change management as well.

I think it's a flag when you when you have one of these documents, a working with document, you can add additional properties and then you can have a git flag get hub flag with the repository name. So I I'll have to look but I think those flies are for documents. And the ones for projects is and other related work is a little different. And there are times that people will collect references to implementations and sometimes that turns into product marketing. And so there's a slippery slope there that we've tried to avoid in the past. But it's not that it's against process or anything. It's yeah it's this So alternatively, maybe implementation section.

We will we go for the for the license this is just a simple, I would say, a architectural point part of your story for various various signals there. And how we can we we can make use of the various. As we said that model this can be closed by the controller to the consumers of this information, it can be the mobile network threshold or whatever other you can have you're in your own deployment. And this information will be given to the network service controller. So the network service controller or can you use for example, attachments to set up the the surface between the deep key and the customer devices and this last for within the the. Next slide please? So this is just an example of the a simple slice example in which you have, I would say a network two peas. And in one side, you have a side, you have a a gateway where a c you have a cluster of facebook functions. These functions you have a set of Ip addresses that are used that are different than the one which is used attachment service. And the other side, you have another site which is connected using dynamic routing in protocol. So next slide, please, So this is this is an example of how we can set up the dutch for example, for the first one which you have the the the layer two, the layer three and the static Ip Ip address is and the next slide, we"

Next slide, please, So once you have set up your attachments circuit, the first one, for example here, previous one. Then when you will set your slice service request, then you just need to characterize your your your service and then just add a pointer to the to the attachment circuits that in which you will terminate your slice service. Next slide, please. So this is a summary of what we the rationale we are fine to to to to describe here is that for the... At least for the network slides service phase we it should be really good at the. This is really restricted to do what is specific to this slides and then we'll use the attachments circuit in order to to factor this I would say this feature among all the... The service model themselves. And then in order to bind, They would say the attachments surplus to the service just make use of the references that are exposed in this in this various attachment circuits. And for example, if there's a new feature which is defined, for example, as a new technology to to to establish your for example, as an additional civil, Is it be or Mp or etcetera that you're using your own deployments? You not need to augment your service model, you just need to do it in the attachment circuits and then all the service models will just use them for for free and immediately. And that's the end of the year presentation. Thank you very much Mate. So any comments because just still have some time for for questions. So for people who wanna hear more ups work group. Right? Ontario working. Exactly you. Okay. Here the important thing is how to relate this work"

This is Tony Lee. I'm be talking about tactical traffic engineering. Colby Birth was scheduled to present, but he's not showing up So you get the b team. Next slide, please. So what we're out to do is to deal with tactical resource depletion. Now historically, we've been pretty good about working towards doing things strategically. We collect a lot of data about our traffic utilization and we feed it into some optimization routines and it Cranks on interesting paths and Cranks away for quite a while, and then outcomes large set of path placements and we feed this into Rs or into Sr and it lays down our network pass. All well I'm good, except in real life stuff happens. You you might get an excess of traffic might get link failures, note failures, you might get presidential motor case, Who knows? Anyhow, things go wrong and all of the wonderful engineering that we go put into these things. May not actually have the results that we want. And so you can end up with congestion in your network. Now historically, what happens at this point is that somebody in the knock reaches in and does something manually and ugly and something as gross is tweak Ig metric."

So So what we're out to do is to do something in a short term time frame that adjusts traffic to you alleviate congestion. Next slide, please? So what we're I have to do is try to do something that's kind of in real time. We wanna recognize congestion when it happens. We wanna take a look at the backup path that we have available in the F. And we wanna enable some those to take some of the traffic load off. And then alleviate the congestion on our protective link. And we'll talk a little bit about flow distribution. Next slide. I'm going kind of fast here because we're running out of time. If you're very interested in this topic, we'll be given the same talk again in routing working group in the next session. Recognizing Previous slide, please. Recognizing congestion pre straightforward. We look in at some congestion thresholds. These are configurable. We sample the interface. We want those samples to exceed the thresholds either high or or low for some number of iterations so that we've got consistent and clear indication that it's consistent congestion. And we don't wanna os So if it's high, we're gonna try to shed some load if it's low, then we're going to undo any of the load shedding we've done. Next slide. In the Feb, We have Ip four or Ip six entries. We can also do this with labels."

    "text": "We can con con do this for any kind of backup path So t I l a, lf a, f r r, whatever it is we have available that is a potential backup path that is loop free and avoids the link that we're trying to protect. And then when we see that path and c congestion, we're going to activate some set of those paths and then that's gonna turn into an Ecm p situation equal cost multi path and hopefully divert some fraction of the traffic. Next slide. When we do select the flow and shift it to the Ecm p, we all that activation. And that happens to Shed. And then when we see that the load on the primary link has come back down, we deactivate prefixes to bring traffic back onto the primary path. Next slide, please. When we do this, it's going to have an impact on the network. Are shifting load onto our Tl Pass. Now assuming you've done a decent job of network engineering and can three your backup paths, there should be spare capacity available there. This is a presumption. If you're throwing back up paths around and are not engineering the bandwidth for them. Well, you're gonna very much get a surprise if and when your primary link actually just fails out and that fails. So that's gonna be a problem. However if you've got multiple places of congestion, running happened concurrently and T t is shifting multiple full situations trying to fix many things in your hot network. At the same time. Could it con con create further congestion? Absolutely."

    "text": "Can that further congestion cause more T activations? Absolutely. So there is a potential for things just shifting and shifting and shifting and not hoping anything. The presumption here is that you do have some spare capacity and if you don't, this is probably not the right feature. Next slide. What is it that we want to load shed? Well, we want to take a look and try to figure out what are the right paths to move? And this is not in trivial decision because we want to actually not change too many things if we don't have to. Every time we do activate or deactivate a prefix, we have remember that the traffic is taking a hit. We are triggering start on all the traffic that's moving. So we really don't wanna do this if we don't have to And so we wanted to select the the right paths. We've played around with this a little bit. We've got multiple strategies that we were working with we don't claim to have a perfect answer at this point. Next slide. Gives me exactly one minute for questions. Adrian. Adrian from thanks Tony. Interest in stuff. I just put a link in the chat to the the t document that is in the few, but there's a little section in there that mentions tactical difficulty tea and I'd appreciate it if you could just check what that's consistent with what you're talking about. Thank you. I'll look at that."

Yeah, we haven't talked while before I bring in Andrew, we haven't talked to the rt chairs about what would be a reasonable home for this. So you'll have that discussion and make that call. Andrew? I just wondering we see Ppe playing a role in a network that also has a live control at the same time. That is entirely possible. It very much depends on exactly what your controller is doing. Obviously, if your controller is set up to do short term engineering that might have some very very bad interactions. I would not recommend that. However or is set for much longer term, you know, A typical thing for some folks used to do was you optimize once a day. And if you're operating your controller on those time frames, then this is perfect. Gotcha. That's it... Yeah. That's exactly those trust mine is. If you had a controller doing that say like optimization, at the same time, T would potentially kind of skew its ability to kind of optimize at the same time. We kinda have two brains in that point kind of fighting each other. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Yeah. None network serve two masters. Thanks, Tony. That brings us to the end of the second session we will see all in San francisco. Thanks for two great sessions. Thank you much."
