What is been changed since the last IETF, so there have been some smaller editorial changes, elaborations And I think there is one major thing so we had, I think, at the last IETF, some discussion about security and privacy issues on several of those use cases which in a way were anticipated because, you know, we have this trust and privacy separate drive which we will also talk about later on But somehow I think in the discussion we came to the conclusion it might make sense nevertheless also to address privacy and trust to a certain extent also in the use case document so the first attempt of achieving that, which you find in the document is that there is now for each year case discussed in the document some very short elaboration on potential privacy and trust issues yeah next slide please And this looks as follows so you see the example down there so that is for the location sharing use case, where I can share my location with other people via structured email, similar like you know it from instant messaging tools and yeah so this kind of privacy and trust discussion here is still quite vague in a way so i'm also seeking feedback on input on that probably here how to make that better. But for instance, yeah, you can easily argue that the privacy level of location sharing is high because it's basically a personal identifiable data about your location or your whereabouts. Trust level so is there any, you know, spamming or something like that? houses can be abused is probably, there's probably not required to be such a high trust level because it's least I cannot imagine in which ways"

It's more or less a process of thinking about how could we find some kind of template for discussing these issues. And one other idea that came up in which we will approach discuss then more later on in the private and trust document is basically probably to mirror these kind of things so to have for the individual use cases some kind of framework where we can say okay this is probably a high trust or a low trust use case and then in the in the privacy recommendations provide two different means probably for clients depending on on the kind of use case and the privacy level required or the trust level required. So for instance, there might be certain information in structured email sent by truckage email, which is not really privacy sensitive yeah, but there might be other stuff like this location which is. So one could for instance say that for that in the trust draft, so for every use case with a high privacy requirement these kind of information should be encrypted for instance So this is probably how these two drafts could interrelate but yeah I would be very happy to some discussion here because I think we this is directly coming out from what we discussed in Brisbane so I would be happy to learn if this is going in a direction that will help us and how we could probably improve this to a certain extent we can either do it now I think there's one more slide anyway Are you going to have more examples, right? in in the trust and security document there now, I think there's one more slide anyway.

So there was, I think, some critique by Pete, for instance, about this copy to clipboard thing, which was quite made a lot of sense So one idea was also probably at some point to add a section a best practice section at the end of the use cases document putting together some recommendations. But this hasn't been started yet yes and yeah there were some there were two people I think volunteering in Brazil to co-author and but we we didn't really do so much work on the document, as I said, also because it was not strictly necessary, but still, I mean, if there is somebody really interested in working on it this, I think any contribution, also review of the document would be quite nice And that's it for now, I think Other people who volunteer in this room?

So how do I, how is the structured email? should it look like and also what kind of behavior needs to be taken into account when sending structured email to somebody else replying to it and so on. I think in general, the aspect of how to put structure data into the email, we have some open issues here to decide in a way, but they are in general I think understood so the trade-offs are understood to a certain extent, and we will discuss about one or two of them in the future following and then there is I think some issues especially those which really to, you know, the interactive issues of structured issues like replying to it, updating it and so on which also in the draft, I think, are not perfectly described yet or well sought through. So I think it's especially for people reviewing or looking at this, I think these are also aspects where any kind of feedback and opinion would be super helpful Yeah, so in terms of updates, again, there were also some editorial fixes in here then there was I think so those of you in Brisbane remember there was this category of how this structured represents of the email relate to the human reader report"

So in cases where you have structured data, which is actually not at all related to the human readable part and actually the structured vacation notice which we will talk about later, might be that case if it's like this kind of preemptive structured vacation notice which is just attached to a regular email and this kind of non-representation case was now added in a more systematic way and yeah there are now two surveys started, and we will talk about them now in the next slide So the idea of these surveys is a little bit there is a problem because we cannot easily look what is already so there is some structured email already sent around because some ISPs are used supporting some kind of lightweight or reduce set of structured email features already but it's really hard to find out to which extent this is happening because obviously email is private, so there is no public thing we can crawl nevertheless we did some tests with own email accounts initially just to have get an initial idea like how many of those structured email exists there also what kind of senders are they are sending so is it widespread already which for the group would probably also be a topic because in terms of being downwards compatible, if a lot of people are already sending that or not and also which kind of formats are probably used.

So this means that probably this data is underestimating the current situation because some of the send might have not included it sending it to that account that was analyzed and yeah what we see here is I think the account was used since some 10 years or something like that, so it's, I think, quite a large account but what you I think what you can see I was personally actually surprised to see so many different um, yeah, categories and also vendors in each and every category already using that It has to be noted probably I think we had some internal discussion already about that, obviously not each and every mail of each of that provider will contain structured data. I mean, this is just a snapshot of the account analyzed. It might also be that only in a given certain amount of times that was used by whoever is listed here But nevertheless, yeah, I mean, one of the ideas was to see is that used already by people or is a data center around, and this obviously seems to be the case to a certain extent but of course it would be helpful to have more of that information and for more accounts, which is why we also want"

I would say, I think it was in roughly 60 or 70% of the cases but there were also a number of vendors particularly I think it was Google by itself for Google Docs and Google Drive emails using microdata for the structured data But yeah, as I said, this is a preliminary data here, but I think this is helpful in a certain way for the group, hopefully in order to drive further decisions.

We just know it happens sometime in those 10 years Next slide. Yeah, if so that initial scan. We just know it happened sometime in those 10 years. Next slide. Yeah, I'm a little bit lost because we, for my yeah. So then there is a second survey and so this is about the full representation case, which currently in the core specification is supposed to be a multipart alternative addition. So, you know, most emails will have multi-part plain text and text HTML in many cases nowadays in rare cases there is calendar invites also used as a multi-bart alternative and this is probably what mostly multi-but alternative is used in practice I've personally not seen anything else beyond that, but yeah, there might be other stuff for that And so I think one major question was here this full representation case is in a way new because the current implementation by those vendors I mentioned earlier doesn't really distinguish full or partial representation at all"

And we could still keep the structured data as impartial representation in the text HTML body embeds or as I just said before doing it as a dedicated multipart alternative However, one thing that popped up while doing some trial implementation, and so on is that actually a lot of libraries and toolings don't allow easily to add a custom multi-part alternative just to give you a particular example if you want to actually follow certain if you want to do a testing for g-mails AMP email, which is a really kind of related structured email mechanism, which use multipart alternative, you cannot actually do this with Google Apps Scripts console because in that API, there is just text HTML and plain text allowed for multipart and you have no means to manipulate the whole mind tree in a way. And if you look in more and more libraries and more tools, which you might want to extend, so we have been looking at Outlook, at Sunderbird extensions, these kind of things, you can mainly distinguish cases in which you might not be able at all to access the whole mind body in order to do something. And if then there is not an experience method for providing multi- alternative on text HTML, you don't have any chance, you wouldn't have any chance to build such an email which obviously is a little bit a blocker in adoption And you also have to distinguish here actually read and write So there might be a difference between building such emails versus parsing them then there is cases where you have a convenience able for text HTML and text plane.

I think many in the room have been spending painful evenings with these kind of things. Of course, one could try to convince library developers to improve on that and provide convenience methods on top of that But still, of course, I mean, there's a lot of programming languages around and so on. So one needs to think about if this is a something to happen soon again or not. And yes, then there might be libraries of course, which have a very clean and nice convenience method also for multipart alternative. And the idea was basically, to really look a little bit deeper into libraries of certain environments and try to find out if this is a concern or not And this survey has been started. You find the document linked there and feel also free to probably put in some notes from the, for the library or environment of your choice because I think many of you might have some experience in certain programming languages where there are certain libraries around and I think that would be helpful then for the discussion on how we want to do the full representation in the crossback As of now, the evidence is like, mixed. I think in the document now, there is like some 10 to 20 um libraries mentioned it's probably too early to discuss it here in front and I also didn't prepare a really nice summary of that But that should be a good starting point to put the decision forward okay comments Philip uh hi"

I just wonder is there another alternative that was discussed? which is to put the representation as a mime header on the the, probably the multi-part alternative? itself or maybe you know both of the or you know all of the the the alternative subparts Um, so some kind of like content description header So, I mean the mere fact if it's full or partial representative you could do by that but the main problem is where to put the actual annotation and that you wouldn't probably fit into a header, I guess right? I mean, I guess depending on the use cases some of them, it seems like it could, I guess maybe that would not be sufficient for all of the use cases but that might be, you know, one possibility to address some of them I mean, especially, I think later in the document, it also mentions you can have an ID that's a CID that references some other mind part so that it describes that specific mind part. So having it as a you know, mime header on that mine part seems like a more direct way to do that. So just to get your right, so what you're suggesting is that in some cases where there is not so much structured data, you could put that into a multi-line header field kind of thing, right? Right, exactly. So I think one of the use cases was for sending like one-time codes You know, that's a very short description So to your initial questions, and I think that particular proposal to my knowledge didn't come up yet. Maybe one of the reasons was that we initially started, of course, with the status quo, which is basically this weird you know, embedding it into the HTML email part and of course there is some glory to a certain extent in not"

But yeah, one also needs to think about not to confuse the users too far. I mean, yeah. Right probably too many options. Can I suggest? you probably also can i suggest at minimum either send the email to the main list just for record so we can have a discussion and maybe we'll create a ticket I forget to say there is there is GitHub tickets they're also linked in the document for most of these particular points especially also for that roni even though they are more meant to, because I think they cannot be used for official discussion because this is supposed to be on the mailing list, right? We can still, you know, track. We use GitHub Yeah, sure, but at least one should, I think, cross links and probably I commented here in the ticket or something I don't know actually how this is typically so solved. The idea of the tickets was basically to capture a little bit from the different discussion streams on the many ways So send email, I'll create a ticket then I'll do that. All right, feed resnick. So I saw Ben's comment in the chat room about, you know, well, maybe multi-part alternative isn't right, maybe multi-part related and which doesn't seem quite right to me But I also saw the comment in the draft about, well, if you're going to do, if you've got a full representation then you should do text playing and text HTML and you must do, I've heard got a full representation, then you should do text plain and text HTML and you must do, I forgot what you must do, but this starts to seem weird"

So plain versus HTML, if you've got a rich text engine, you can switch to HTML If you don't, you can use the plane, that'll come first This seems somehow different, and I'm not, I can't quite get my head around what the solution here is, but and especially if you've got engines where you can't see the rest of the mime structure right? If that's part of what's driving you to, you know, run into these problems maybe, I mean, in addition to being able to put a header in that just has the structured data and that's all you need, but if you've got more complicated structured data, maybe a hint header there was something that we used to have like a content dash something There was something for voice data. Yeah part of the voice stuff that pointed down into the message into the right place that let you know where the thing, if you were interested in looking for this, you don't have to parse the whole thing, go find it. Yeah, part of VPM, I think probably, yeah. And maybe it's worth looking at some mechanism to get around some of this So if I understood you correctly, those are two slightly different things"

So for the second point, about, you know, giving an intuition in the headers that there's structured data inside, I think there is something like that in the document at the later stage There is some header field or header information proposed just for the case also where you retrieve headers in a order to know which ones to further analyze but that what you proposed might be going even beyond that so you might want to have a look at that yeah i'll take a look And actually, so the rationale, what is currently there between text HML and text plain as a fallback was mainly based on the assumptions that this is like basically what is this is supposed to be also for calendaring and so on. One can, of course, relax that but I wonder if what will happen then if somebody receives that in a client that cannot do it with that see an empty mail I mean at least in the text HTML part, you see a in the text HTML part you see a goberish HTML me I guess I would just give it softer guidance. And maybe it's still a should, but should provide some other part where non-capable clients can use it and not be so specific. That's a fair point, yeah Hi, daniel petrie I think the separate mind part is very interesting for many cases where you just want to automatically parse it or the users not necessarily looking at it because you put it into the HTML, we sometimes see HTML emails where the HTML is 30 megabyte and if you have some small thing that just kind of we just quickly extract this, then you need to pass your way through 30 megabytes that is not always what you want to do so I think that's a very strong case, both for full representation, but also when it's not the full representation let's say you have a long email with a lot of stuff in it, but there is something in there that you want"

Can you give a, like, uh, level more of detail here? Because in my understanding, even for the multi-part alternative, you need to like, if the email is big, you still need to deal with like so 30 mega here? Because in my understanding, even for the multi-part alternative, you need to, like, if the email is big, you still need to deal with like 30 megabytes in order to pull out that multi-part alternative, right? Exactly, but you only need to scan through it, but with HD the multi-part alternative you need to like if the email is big you still need to deal with like so 30 megabytes in order to pull out that multi-part alternative right I don't know but you only need to scan through it but with HTML you actually have to decode the mind part into something that an HTML parcel can then read, and then you have to run the HTML parser and get to the parts that then have some JSON or whatever in it and then feed that to a JSON processor so you still have to do a lot of like allocate another 30 megabyte buffer that you then oh JSON or whatever in it and then feed that to a JSON parser. So you still have to do a lot of like allocate another 30 megabyte buffer that you then okay that's it's more this kind of thing if you can just scan through the data as is more or less because most of the structured data is going to be kilobytes maybe even just a few hundred bytes so being able to do that very efficiently is so certainly interesting okay because we already see similar issues with like on the Emikline side being able to show like a snippet where you're going to show the first sentence or whatever"

But I do want to add my plus one to Philip and Pete and Daniel where I think there should be a top level, maybe a structured header that can either contain the data itself as a small enough or it provides a content ID to the exact part that actually has that ID or has the data rather We did something like this for I'm up a while back Didn't get wide adoption, but in practice it worked quite well where rather than having to search through to find eye calendar data there was a top level header that actually said this is where to go find it.

So I just wanted to also push in the direction of the multi-part alternative approach or a structured header I don't think that actually I've been learning really about just how flexible you can be in terms of what you can stuff into the headers. It's remarkable how much stuff. And if we're really talking about a kilobyte of data, I think that actually fits But I don't like I share the reservations that other people have expressed about how having to have, well first having to parse an HTML part, but also just having to have an HTML part in order to parse that the the structured data seems like a potential mistake I don't necessarily want to send text to HTML if I don't need to, and maybe my message has other bits that I can do So it just strikes me as a better approach to avoid depending on text HTML And also, I wanted to mention that you're talking about easy, difficult, impossible here for the support. I think it would be good to try to characterize this as easy, difficult, possible for the generation. Yes, it's a send aside versus, yeah. Because it it's hard to generate, people will just switch to tools for generating their mail that can handle it if they want to generate it i'm not as worried about that if it's actually hard to consume, then it's a then the discussion gets a little bit different, right? actually I didn't mention that I mean in most cases where I looked at I think it was more or less, it didn't make such a big distinction because you know where it matters that you"

I think what I'm trying to say is not that it's a matter for specialized tools but that if your goal is to send, then you have the incentive to pick a tool that will let you do the sending. Whereas people don't understand that they might even be receiving this and they might not be willing to move their mail clients for the sake of receiving such a message I think the incentives are different on the, so it's worth splitting those perspectives. Okay that point, yeah Philip again, just to add a little bit more on the HTML bit, I think there's also some security considerations where, you know, when, when you're receiving in email but the mail client is not in the foreground, you may not want to parse the HTML And when you do it, you know, want to do it in a separate more tightly restricted process. So that adds, you know additional overhead as well so just throwing a bit more on the, against the HGN HGM HGN Thank you. Lyndon again. I would really like to see that we have the ability to specify this as its own standalone mine part"

There may be times when it does make sense to plop it into the message body, but for us, I think those would be fairly rare. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the security implications that go along with this, because what we would use this for is for the forms of submission service that we have that's typically used by healthcare offices where doctors will pre-screen pre-collect a whole bunch of information from their patients before they set up an appointment This is extremely private data and we have to be able to unambiguously flag this with a security policy that says, don't you dare send this outside the hush is extremely private data, and we have to be able to unambiguously flag this with a security policy that says, don't you dare send this outside the Hushmail ecosystem I think that's going to be easier if we split that off into a separate mine part But again, I really have to think about this. And I need to take it back and talk with our developers, too, and see what they say about that But, and I'm not sure the multi-partner termination would actually makes sense to me. I don't get it in my head how you do something like that but um seriously consider making us separate blob an option here that will make this same much more useful, I think, in the general case case All right Thank you closed, yeah, I think Yeah, so these are the points basically"

Yes. And yeah, this is why it's, of course addressed in a way already in the spec, but as I said, these points more or less need a little bit more discussion So I think that's, I'm not sure if it makes sense to talk through all of them again because we did that already in Brisbane. And but probably there is a call out to everybody also to have a look at the document here, read through this and I think there is also a lot of unknowns probably behind those those different aspects because just to make one example there is a difference once we deal now with structured data because imagine you have for instance an information about an email about a flight going on, right? And there is an update of the flight email. Right now, if it's a human readable message, the sender can very easily You know do a red text on top This is an up, your flight is updated. This is updated in information and the recipient clearly understands what's going on If you have structured, if you have structured data within that email, and we assume now the full representation case, so the email client will just, you know, show the structured data offset flight information. Of course, there needs to be a way for the email client to understand that that second email coming in with updated structured data override the first. And"

For myself, so there's no so that brings us to the last slide of this presentation So as I said, I think one of the main focus right now is to get more information and I think the discussion today was also very helpful on that more of a feeling of people really implementing these things, like what kind of solutions they would prefer in order to you know pass all these kind of things so I think that were very helpful input here We have set survey probably where we can also get another perspective on this. I think we will probably also look a little bit more into existence examples and provides this kind of tool for scanning. I will sense it around on the mailing list in the next couple of weeks probably And yeah, there was actually one additional cross-cutting aspect that was mentioned this week on the mailing list and I'm looking at trend probably if he wants to step in at that point shortly.

And I think differentiating between the author right, I created the message and I want to put, you know, like dragging an image into the mail, I want to put this structured data in versus the client that goes, wait a minute, hey, I'm going to do some artificial intelligence thought for you and I'm going to put the, you know, some sort of structured, structured content in here. But the author didn't know. And then similarly, you know, every step along the chain, whether it's, you know, the sending mail server, the, you know any mTA in the middle or you know you even the delivery agent could insert stuff, right? So I think that carrying along, who put it, in so that the receiver can make some sort of clever decisions would make sense So anyway, that was the thought, hopefully that is what you were trying to get out of me Hans-Yog Next. No. Yeah little bit different. Yeah so as I already vote on the list, I think what made that remind me of was, I think, a discussion we had maybe at the boff also, also, which was about that some ISPs are currently also you know, if there's no structure data in an email to automatic extraction of structured data and stores this also in a certain way and this might also be added then to the email and would be, in my opinion, a similar case like you mean here because the provenance would then also be like auto-generated"

I don't know if anybody has an opinion on that or input Like certainly there are I think headers added by MTAs and so on Is that an issue? Because usually there is I mean, okay, there's certain signatures sometimes which allow it to derive who edited it, but that's not always a case, right? I mean, sometimes I think there is, I mean, I'm obviously not an MTA guy, but I know, for instance, that sometimes also on incoming, there are certain headers cleared out to make sure these headers like, for instance, authorized keys headers or something like that that this is not spoofed by the external or something like that so it seems to me that there is also a lot of"

Speaking to that, you know, it seems to me that the best place to put the Providence information and then similarly the signature, if you want to put it there you know, for verification purposes, or, you know, or if it's encrypted, whatever would be as close to the data itself as possible And there's also going to be multiple, I can foresee and I'll write this all up in these cases, so thank you, Alexi, I will write it up But I think that the if different, MTAs are different parts of the pipeline modify different parts of that, or add different context to the message using this mechanism each of them is going to want to say, well, this is my part. I wrote this part. And then I wrote this part And then putting that up in a header somewhere, even if cry cross-referencing it, I think would be, eh, just be harder to put back together.

I think it does really work. It works if you process that data on the server but on the client that could very likely fail. And so there are lots of things like, do we need something else? where we just kind of sign just the structured data, which get us into a lot of trouble. But I think there is think there's there's a lot of subtle complexity there Okay, then sit down Let me I think that you're saying that we, that least the trust and consideration should should say something a lot the lines of Czech D Kim on the way in, um I'm not sure.

Kim and SBIF are only guaranteed to be back at delivery time, which may be entirely different from when the mail user agent receives them And there's additionally a privacy leak of doing D-KIM look-ups on any given message. It creates a sort of a web bug situation like a read receipt that you may not be intending to do So I think it would be a big mistake if this said that the client needs to do decim or SPF, A, because it wouldn't work, and B, because it's introduces new problems. I do think that we might want to think about how we talk about it with ARC, or I don't know that it different pieces well enough, but if you want to trust your mail transport agent to identify that, yes, this D-KIM signature was good, and they want to inject that into the message, and you want to verify that, that seems plausible, but the real thing that I think we would like to say is you should if you're not sure that this is coming from who it's coming from, you should be looking for end-to-end cryptographic signatures on the message and you know if your mail user agent breaks the message as it downloads it and you can't check that, then that's a problem with the mail user agent Yes, all of that, I think it might be worth putting into the document. I hope I didn't just volunteer myself to write it a couple of paragraphs. All right Are you talking? about a male client that doesn't touch? its survey really? This is daniel huang Gilmore. I'm always talking about mail clients that don't trust their servers I think mail servers are generally untrustworthy In fact, when we say how does Gmail do this, my partner recently received an email message and turned to me and said, I was looking at their calendar on Google Calendar and said, why do I have this flight from city X to city Y? I don't understand And that was because Gmail had in jail a forwarded message from my father that he had c-seed to both of us that included his travel itinerary.

Which? try again. So I guess the security and privacy concern of having structured data forward on to, like for example, if I send my location to somebody, and then they forward that email onto someone else you know, I'm concerned about that Some of that is captured but I have at least two new things that need capture from this week And there is either at least maybe ticket and there is definitely text on the base pack about this So this is still on the result issue, you know, what recommendation is it's a partially resolved issue i should say I would question that actually, but...

For example, if it's a trusted sender, I don't want to send a ping back I don't want to tell him when I read the message that I read the message And so I don't want to have external resources being loaded even if it's coming from a trusted senator because he might be putting images from, I don't know where, or I don't want him to track me, even though I trust this person so I think a more useful mechanism would be user interaction to require user interaction before any action happens and that would have solved this case with a flight from somebody else being put in your calendar. I think that's pretty crazy. I think exchange does that as well. I'm receiving an invitation It immediately ends up in my, in my calendar I'm surprised that no spammers have used that what I would expect as a user that I actually click on it before it's added to my calendar So that would probably stop most of the, or many of the problems or the trust, the security problems being mentioned here"

This is the other Daniel, daniel king Gilmore so you may want to point to a draft that is coming out from LAMPS soon, which is draft IETF E2E mail guidance that offers cryptographic guidance on how to do end-to-end cryptographic protections, either signatures or messages. We have done a terrible job for the last 30 years of doing that, but the only way to solve that is to try to actually solve it, and that's where that works is happening, and this draft does not need to solve that problem here You can point to that work. Please send me a link Oh, next Hold on, sorry, I'm trying to do multiple things. I'm doing it better Trent Yeah, just one thing. I think there's, and I might be confused this. This might be my problem, so I think there's a lot of talk about using decim for the authentication. And I think that's great D Kim is for authentication of the messages itself, right? The integrity of the message. And to some degree, the identification of the sending domain but i think that there's also a piece that might be being conflated here, and that is the integrity and verification and maybe even encryption of one data element or a set of data elements or the entire S encryption of one data element or a set of data elements or the entire SML package. And I think there's separate concepts I would be interested in at least allow if not enabling, the encryption and signing at a per element basis within the structure So hopefully, I'm not overly confusing things or maybe it's me being confused"

    "text": "Question. Do you regard a multi-part alternative that has a text? HTML and an equivalent text LDJ? No, not text something, application LDJ? do regard those as different in trust terms? I do personally because again this goes back to maybe this is my hobby horse I'm interested in the concept of multiple entities being able to decorate the message with SML structured data, right? So at some points someone's going to put different data in there, and I could foresee different data elements having different levels of security control wanting to be applied. As an example, one data element with a JSON LD representation might be perfectly fine and in fact might be a good idea for it to be in the clear But then a sub element or another element, you might want to encrypt that so that only one party or another that has the key, the private key or whatever can decrypt it So I can see that we wouldn't want to treat in my opinion, right? My opinion is I wouldn't want to treat all of the SML structured data as either being in the clear or encrypted. I'd rather see it you know, allow for if not enable, the encryption at the per element level. Hopefully that answers your question I suppose it does Jim. jim fenton"

    "text": "I get a little bit nervous when I see trust and decim kind of used in the same sentence because we were very careful in defining decim trying to make sure that people didn't say oh wow this is a, this is a great place for key story and we're just going to use it for all these encryption things as well DQM keys aren't required to be stored in DNSSEC signed zones and so forth And, you know, it's it's, it's really, it's just enough trust in order to kind of get you a good indication of the providence of a message And it kind of stops there. And I hope that you know, using D Kim in this, in this context we aren't trying to imply that it's any stronger than that that I see what you are saying I would ask my stronger than that. I see what you are saying. I would ask the same question again. Is there any difference between text HTML that says, this is your flight? and the structured data in a multi-part alternative structure that says the same thing thing it does you know there are new use cases, I mean, I think in that particular use case you know somebody gets an invitation we're used to getting, we're kind of used to that But in the structured mail case, I think we're looking at some additional use cases that might have stronger needs Right I myself said something about SIV actions earlier today, a difference in degree becoming a difference in kind Still, I would really like this document to just say that"

    "text": "a lot of servers a lot of mail receivers check DECIM on the way in and use that to decide whether to accept a message or not, but not really connect Dikim to an individual body part Right, but I mean, they don't even use it to decide whether to accept the message or not. They just use it along with a whole bunch of other factors to make a decision. Yep It's, use it to decide slippery. Use it to decide whether to, yeah. Okay, just to minutes left uh danio can go more again uh uh trend i just wanted to push back on your notion of part-wise cryptographic protections um what wide protection part what part wise meaning individual parts being signed or encrypted compared to the rest of the message. We've been thinking about this a lot over in LAMPS, and it's pretty scary and users don't know how to reason about it I've mentioned in the chat that we used to use HTTP for websites only for the credit card entry form or only for the login and we discovered very early on although it took us like 15 years to sort it out that that doesn't actually work, right? The users can't distinguish between these things you don't get the sorts of protections that you're looking for unless you encrypt at the scale that the user are capable of considering So please, I beg you, this draft, if you're gonna push for part wise cryptographic protections, do it somewhere else and don't do it in this draft because there are other folks who wanna do that I can see some advantages to it, but it needs to be thought out as a separate project, not as part of, that's the snuck into SML. Right You would like me to add an example of how part-wise protection can confuse people Yep"

This is an individual graph still It has to become a working group draft or else turn down So I might use the last few seconds to call for adoption as well working group drafts. Yes but we can oh okay shall I do a polls Do people want a polls Now, I'll send me on the list. Okay you lost the chance damn it damn it i want to play for the tool. It's the new shiny shiny shiny Oh. Well this is like different levels Yeah, you kind of mentioned it. Let's just say that we ran out of time and don't treat this today Okay all right, wow Well Okay. Do people feel that we have a bit more me? with a document that we can adopt by the working group? Because I think people agree that we need something in this space, but is this getting closer to what we can start working in the working group now? Some nods okay, well obviously, we still need to do an adoption call Sorry, I'm just doing what I wanted to do with the tool by just asking the question Okay, so, well, um,"

Thank you all. We well, I suppose we'll talk about vacation draft next time or maybe Hans York actually, you can send them email to the mailing list, summarizing recent changes and asking people for yeah for yeah okay all right did uh mary did you want 30 seconds on the mic uh yeah Just remind everybody, please keep chattering on the list. When I noticed the list has gone down between meetings, I get very nervous So none of this, it's chat, but no of this stuff, like the conversations are happening elsewhere like, no, no, no, do it so we can see it I don't know I have to deal with Roman Okay. Thank you all See you online Thanks for back to you know, to just just yeah"
