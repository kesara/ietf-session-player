So for people who aren't familiar with the P Quip working group, which I know, I I I see lots of unfamiliar faces. This is this working group is not meant Rowan wants me to speak closer. Thank you. I can do that. Thank you. Thank you. That her her voice carries much better than mine. This working group is not, in fact, is chartered not to make protocols.

We also are sort of the home of last resort, for, algorithms that need for protocols that need post quantum algorithms, and don't actually have a, a working group anymore. We aren't really working on that now. But in addition, we get to have other drafts. So what you see on the status here is, wow, that's That's very directional. We have 2 drafts that we've been working on actively on the mailing list. The first one, is called hybrid terminology. We'll have it presentation on that later. The reason for this that that draft came up is that lots of different working groups are looking at what's generally called hybrid use of post quantum. And they were using the words differently. So we said, okay. This is a good central place for us to do this. It is a working group item. We aren't quite done yet. People keep getting good ideas. That's a good thing. We're not in a rush. The second one is and I originated many years ago that people in CFRG thinks still exists there but it doesn't, that has come here, which is getting lots and lots activity on the mailing list This is It's a hard document to write because it's it's essentially know, post quantum for people who don't know post quantum. Or quantum for people who don't know quantum. So how low of a level, how high of a level we're getting great response on the mailing list We wanna keep that up. This document's gonna be super valuable. It's it's valuable now, but even at once it's published, It's the kind of thing that folks in this room, when someone asked them, oh, well, what's, you know, what is this quantum thing you can hand this off to them.

So at IETF115, a group of us got together because we well, with all this PQ stuff coming, we wanna make sure that we can work with each other implementations. So we started we thought let's get together and start testing some of these new algorithms and you know, see what comes from it. And so this product's actually grown quite a bit and it turns out, the the nest, migration to post credography project, the NCC OE. Actually looking at us, so they have different subgroups. There's an X 5091, and they actually are looking to us to provide them testing. So I'm just gonna go through a little bit about the project. Probably most of you know about it, and I'll give an update on what happened this week. Can go to the next slide. So for those of you don't know, so we have a github repository that was kind of place we started. It's it's actually in the high ETF hackathon. And the first thing we thought, okay. Well, how are we gonna do this? How am I gonna I wanna test something from from you know, another person and I have created it. How are we gonna do that? Well, let's let's create kind of an artifact format, a define a format that we're going to be able to use that I can download other people's format, and then I can run it against my code. So I have a description of that later, so we define an artifact repository we store that. And as you can see on the right hand side there, we right now, we have 11 different providers. So a provider is someone that creates this artifact of, PQ signatures, for instance, and others can then if if you have an implementation you're working on and you just wanna test it, can pull down one of those implementations and, you know, test it against your stuff. So that's one thing we have. We also have a prototype OID mapping table that's very important because as you know, lot of these algorithms won't they're new. They don't have points defined by this yet. Or just even defined. So we need to agree on what coins we're gonna use so that"

Yeah. So this is an example of our current artifact pository format is very simple. It's just a zip file. So, basically have a name, dashoid. Actually, the group probably needs to discuss that that beginning part. But, anyway, essentially, you have the OID value dot TA, which represents a trust anchor. So it's a self signed certificate. It's because with a self sign certificate, and when you do a verify, basically to check whether the signature is correct, whether it's not correct. And We also have the end entities for Kyber because obviously it can't be signed because it's a cam. It's signed by DialatheM too. So very simple format. We have documentation for it. We also support the hybrid formats. So there's an example that where you combine different OID values. We also have the catalyst and we have chameleon as well. So anyway, you can go to the next slide. I just wanna It's very simple. You can can take a look. So this is our OIN mapping table. So we recently just updated this when NIST came out on August 24th with their new, draft standards for FIFs 204, 205, and, 203. You can see on the left, that's the name that we call it. You notice there's a dash IPD against a lot of them. That's because we don't Warner. Do a final definition because, obviously, we know those always are gonna change. Falcon obviously hasn't changed because there isn't a a draft of that yet from this, a final Well, that's that's pre final draft specification. Then we have the oides that we're using, and that's the next column. And then the 3rd column tells you where they're coming from. So that's pretty self explanatory, and there's a link to that too. So you can take a look at that. We go to the next slide? So here's an example of some of the algorithms tested. So you just see a kind of a shorts"

If you go to the next slide, you'll see why because we've tested a lot of algorithms. Because some of these like, you might notice some of them are from NIST has had a number of rounds. Right? There's around 2. There's around 3. So the MLDSA 44 IPD are the current ones. The ones called dilithium, right, they were the round 3 ones. Right? So we've been doing this for a year now. So if they have changed, that's why have to have this oil mapping table art. We're gonna run into issues when we try to test this. Then you can see on the right hand side too, we've also tested different combinations of some of the the composites and hybrids. So anyway, so there's an and we're open to testing more things, Jay. I know there's a group that wants to test to end through. Right? And, of course, there's more algorithms coming. We know what possibly McLease or bike or HQC or, you know, even that whole whole new round that missed a salt forward with, like, the Mayo algorithm and those things. So anyway, we're open to testing those. It's just I mean, there's a lot of them. So next slide, And so this is an example of mltsa87. Some of the testing that actually happened. This is pretty hot off the press week, people were working on updating their their implementations and and recreating that that Zip format and then uploading them. And we have some scripts that that basically can create these things. So you can see there's 4 to 5 different implementations. So that's really good, right? So that's the ones that's compatible with the latest, missed, I think, 204. And, Yeah. So you can see some columns. People are still working it, and you can see the company I work for Entrust is didn't have anything yet, because I'm close to getting my added, but not quite quite quite But next week, I'll do that. Anyways, that's just an example of what that's just one. We have one for every single algorithm. Right?

So on September 30th, there was eight people that showed up. It was all virtual. It was on a Saturday, so people gave up their Saturday to come together. Like getting together. We have fun. And, yeah, so that was great. The other thing missed when they came on August 24th with their draft releases weigh. Like, okay, we need to update our our, OID repository, at the OID, sorry, at the OID mapping table. So we need to update that. So we did that. Then we decided, okay. What is the core we're doing? Because we had the zip format where everything was getting thrown into the zip file and we're like, well, what the core of this project is is testing the PQ algorithms, the simplest way to do that. I showed you the format, it's just to have the root, self sign roots, and then have the the the end entities with the Kyper, for instance, or other Kims. So that's the core. And then you'll see later we've actually even expanded to other default formats, but we'll get to that in a second. Let's see. Yes. I think I said that. Yeah, the owing mapping table is updated and all the other highlight too, and you just seen it in the previous slide, we actually have 4 unique algorithm implementations of MLDSA. So it's not just everybody using libopen quantum safe. I mean, a lot of people use that. But there's actually there's Bouncey Castle. There's a PQ shield and crypto Next, I think, as well. I think those are the 4 and live open qualms safe. So It's actually a true that we want that variety. Right? So If you have an implementation of these algorithms, please join us. We would love to interrupt with you. So, Next slide, please. Yeah. So the, yeah, so we also added a table describing the source the PQ algorithms, just like I said before, because before, we didn't have that some people might think everyone's having their own unique. So if when you go into that table, there's a link there. You can actually see okay, this, you know, the interest we use live open Guam safe for ours at the moment."

And, yeah, so something a new development, I guess, this past hackathon too. Alexander's been working on a CMP zip file format. Right? So test the CMP protocol. And he's looking forward to even even being able to use it as a a CMP interoperable test suite, which would be great for those of us that implement CMP. Obviously, we're hoping to do that for other protocols if people are interested, like, maybe CMC or other formats. But anyway, that's just a start and Yeah. So a couple other things that there's actually a few pages of slides. So the multi auth for certificate finding implementation. That's, draft and lamp. So that's being worked on. And There's also, it didn't happen yesterday, but there's a new discovery draft in lamps as well that didn't get to be presented, but there's actually some discussions going on in the group. How maybe that discovery and multi auth finally could work together. So this is this is what happens when a table know, people get together. We start to think about things that are out there and even some new doc ideas come up. So you can go to the next slide. Yeah. So the like this, this is our table. Actually, we actually, at one point, we had 3 tables on the So you can actually see that one table full, the secondary one is full, and then there's a little bit on the So I showed you a bit of the new updated compatibility matrix. So that's obviously every time someone puts new artifacts and we wanna get that updated, we had a good discussion. A little bit of a discussion on chameleon certificates Russ came by. So anyway, you can ask us about that after. First competency that Kim implementation was being developed. By one of the people at the table. That's great. The composite signatures implementation, some of them are being up dated to the new dash 10 version. And, Yeah. And we had a bunch of discussions too at the table about the the composite signatures and, non separability and those kinds of things. And that's, I mean, that's all good. That's all fruitful."

So it's great. So next slide, please. And, yeah, a little bit. I think testing PQC protocol updates. Yeah, so as I mentioned a bit earlier, it's it's recognized that, PQC is not just you know, for the algorithms themselves, every protocol and everything we're using today is gonna have to be updated. So there is quite a lot of interest in, some of these protocol ping updates. I mentioned CMP before. So there's been some up to work done on CMP with some cam additions. That's There's a draft on that. Some people have actually started to implement that. CMS updates. So the camera draft So I I have links to the drafts later on as well. And there's OCSP and there's others and I mean, so Again, the core of this is to test all the PQC stuff. Obviously, they're used in protocols. So next slide. The other thing that a lot of members of our group are very interested in is how how are we gonna migrate people from, you know, existing where we are today or their customers, how are we gonna migrate them to these new PQC algorithms? So Some people might think some of us are crazy, but we are exploring. You know, different ways of doing migration mechanisms. So there's the binding for multi off. And I have the drafts linked here. This certificate discovery, chameleon certificate's at signatures, comps at chem, external public keys, Actually, a new one that just came up in the last couple of days the Merkel Tree ladder stuff. Think there could be some really interesting use cases there as well. So there's some discussions going on about that as well. So it's kind of also, I guess you could say, do a lot of talking at the hackathons. Right? So in some ways, that's even more value. Right? There's a lot brainstorming going on And, Yeah. The other thing is, just at the last point, you'll you're gonna see Antonio's gonna present on the P Quip PQ use cases document. So if we come up, you know, as part of this process,"

So I guess we'd like to get together and have fun. So we we're gonna continue to progress on this. Next meeting we have. So we have meetings monthly, just for an hour and talk about where we are on the project. So the next one is Tuesday, December 5th. And, there's some discussions of possibly a new virtual interim hackathon if that happens probably towards the end of January. Kind of in between the next IETF. Doing compatibility matrix updates, and we have our GitHub page there. Then you can go to the last slide, where I say join us. So if you're doing PQC stuff and you wanna test things join us.

So the first working group document that we're talking about is, the hybrid schemes and flow. Hi, everyone. I'm Flo from the UK NTSC. I just wanna set expectations. This presentation has no pictures of really happy implementers. All the slides look like this. So you know, just that's where we're starting. There are there are there are no folks at all, to be honest. It's it's a big disappointment. Cool. So this is the terminology for post quantum traditional hybrid schemes. Yeah, next slide, please. So I think most people, have probably been to one of these meetings before, but if you haven't, idea here is that this is an informational draft to standardize a kind of glossary or a vocab list. For post quantum traditional hybrids, which admittedly does take quite a long time to say. It's terminology, so I should say all the words. The aim is to ensure that we've got consistent see across different protocols within the IETF and where possible across different standards and organizations, although, of course, know, there's limited the control we can have there. It we're also I'm also trying to make it clear what security properties, a particular hybrid construction claims, so that we can kind of assess appropriately a hybrid against the properties that it claims it has."

This was adopted by Pequip a couple of meetings ago, and the last meeting, we've had an update, which I'm gonna talk through today. Cool. So 01 version, just as a summary, the biggest change which I'll come onto in a bit more detail in a minute is adding some new definitions for properties of post quantum hybrid signature schemes. So this is mainly inspired by, Brita Hale and Nina Binder's paper and note on hyped signature schemes. So what I've tried to do is to transpose some of the language that was in there, and move it into Graphs that we can use in the IETF. I've also added some alternative language for the basic definition. So we've had some discussion before about, like, want to say post quantum or quantum resistant or quantum safe. I think at the last meeting, we sort of settled on the headline terms. But what I've done here is just added the you may also hear these terms underneath there to try and capture some of that discussion. Updating references, updating naming, and removing some editors' notes, which I'll also come on to in a minute. On the naming, so it's kind of talk been talked about through the week, like, Kyber is not the same as ml cam and Dilithium is not the same as MLDSA. But in the context of this draft, these are just they're kind of placeholders for this is an example of post quantum chem. So we do want to have the the terms that will be standardized by nest in the long term. Cool. Next slide, please. So I'm not gonna go into any detail on these new definitions because, I'm gonna leave that to Deidris talk later. But we've added these new definitions, for properties that hybrid schemes might have.

So I took all the editor's notes out. No. Seriously. So we're free Additives notes. One of those was this point about should we distinguish between source authentication and identity authentication. This was kind of trying to capture the idea of in a certificate chain, you are, you are attesting both to the identity of the user through the certificate chain and also to source through the signature on the message or the exchange. This kind of felt important to me when I started writing the draft but there's been no comments on it. It's not really something we pull apart anywhere else So I've decided that we can just remove it if people disagree. Well, please suggest some, definitions and I'll add them back in. Addison note 2, which was should we define more properties? We've done that. Again, if people think there are more properties we should define, happy to add them. And then the third one was about if we wanted a definition of more concept around, hybrid sig hybrid certificates, There were no comments I will read the editor's name. But since I removed the editors note, there have been a few suggestions that we add definitions for a mixed certificate chain. So a certificate chain that includes a mix of post quantum certificates, post quantum traditional hybrid certificates, and or traditional certificates, any of that, just kind of catch all.

So we don't specify RSA and if you have one, but we kinda hit strongly in that direction. Obviously using traditional or traditional cryptographic algorithm is a really broad term. But we don't I don't think we necessarily want to refer to the kind of every single algorithm ever here. So I think it'd be a useful discussion to have on the list because I don't know what the right outcome is, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Us. Take your father. Yeah. Okay. The second one is actually about the multi algorithm scheme. We need I don't know whether this good one or maybe we give another definition like, multi component skin. Because, multi, algorithms thing, yeah, since like, It is just a scheme. Consists of our multi algorithms"

So I you did you made some comments on the list about this, and I I tried to update the definitions, in response to your to your comments. So I think if you could, you know, if you take a look and sort of see whether we've got close enough, what more you'd like to change And then, again, do some of this. That would be great. Yeah. Thank you. Philip Hello. If you go back to the editors, notes, slide, Yeah. I think actually there is a utility in distinguishing between the two source authentication, identity, authentication in that if you have a lot of documents, You can do the identity authentication on the key wants, and then apply it to multiple individual documents. So that's one area where it's useful. But more generally, the signature on this particular document fails, Well, there's no recovery. If, however, I've got a signature on the document Well, I know that in the peaks world, you have the certificate chain, and that is the chain, and that's it. But that's not the only PKI will that we necessarily live in. And if we're going to think about things with things with clarity. I think that's in the we move into the PQ world, We're going to be looking at other ways of authenticating validating the key, and that will come in useful. For example, if you pick up an electric curve key, in a blockchain. Oh god. I said that word. Sorry. If you pickle it today, Well, you can be pretty sure that that signature That key was valid 20 years hence. If it was a dilithium key Of course, it was lifted. When you enroll"

Thank you.

That would be super helpful. Thank you. Hi, Roman Danilia. I came up to the mic to talk about just a little bit about process and or the process options given some of the some of what I heard. You know, a little bit I heard is let's work a group last call. Let's kind of publish the other I mean, I heard the other end of the continued living kind of document. I just wanna remind There may be an in between option, and this it's an option a little bit that we see when we have protocol document, and we wanna wait for field experience and implementation experience. So the pattern there is. We take the document. We work in group last call the document. We're we say given what we know now, we're very, very comfortable with the words but we wanna wait just in case. And so you could work in your glass call it you could then say let's park it for 6 months and kind of 1 year and then if we're if things are exactly how we we think we are or whatever that time duration can then go forward. And that might be a halfway point. So rum before you go, the question, Emma, and Mike had brought this up and I pointed at him he got it right. Other documents are referring to this one, and and and they will probably move forward. Tripps do you feel comfortable with a standard track algorithm or protocol document. That says I'm using the same terminology as this one, and this one is still a draft. Because I would imagine terminology should in fact be nailed. I mean, especially if they're calling out. This good terminology"

Especially for us chairs. Sure. I I can officially kind of answer if you have made the reference obviously as a normative reference because it's so crucial to what you've done protocol, the the protocol document is gonna sit and misrep, which is gonna make a lot of not happy, and that is likely not an outcome we want. And so if we are in that situation, we should publish and make a fist if it turns out we were wrong. So normative versus informative does matter. So, with with normative, it'll sit in misref. If it's informative, it'll publish the the the protocol, document will move forward. So then I would ask you and Paul Waddlers to look for that as you are processing other documents. If you're getting a feeling that we're supposed to push this forwards So we could do a working group last call at some point but then we need to get it to you. There's delay in such if you and Paul can be looking for that, since we're not looking at all the documents you're looking No. That's fair. And I'd also just as a process thing, it reminds me if there's no harm in working with last calling it kinda twice. So if we think we're kind of close, we can just work from call cut as well, and we could we could it again if we need So so the queue is closed. So take it to the list.

We have we made some small changes since the IETF, 117 meeting, we added in a section of authenticated key exchange, which we'll be talking about later. And, we added in some well, terminologies for the post quantum versus quantum ready resistant because there was a discussion in the working group, and there was some discussions about how to put these two terms in the context of post quantum cryptography, We added a small section of Iqv2 as well. And which she refers the RFC 9242 that actually Well, it helps fragment large public key sizes for post quantum key exchanges. Next one. We also added in a chem based AKE diagram as well.

So it should be simultaneously verifying. And next one being hybrid generality, it's nice if these things can be created without while relying on the same security notions of these you know, security proofs, so that we can compose them together without having to go back the blackboard and write a whole new security proof from scratch. So that's kind of general notion, and next, please. And now non separability. So these hybrid schemes are being constructed from multiple existing signature schemes of some sort. Usually tradit one traditional, like your, your ECDSA, and something that's post quantum, like dilithium or falcon. When you're shoving these two steams together, you can have a range of notions of can you separate them apart? If you have no non separability, they are fully separable. So if you just smushed 2 signature schemes together and didn't do anything else about them. You could, in theory, just strip one of them off, like your PQ 1, and then hand the message and signature and public key to, a verifier you would like and be like, verify the signature, please. And they will never have any indication that This was supposed to be hybrid. This will verify fines. There's no other indication or artifact that this was supposed to be part of a hybrid scheme.

So that's better than nothing. The next one is strong unseparability, artifacts existing in the signature scheme itself, which are basically The signature components will not verify. If they don't have this notion of the hybridness being in there. So, like, they will fail even if you try to to strip them. And then the next the the biggest one is strong non separability with simultaneous verification. So you get that strong non separability. And you get the 2 schemes must verify at the same time. It's not one than the other because if you have one than the other, you can just stop at the first one and Yay. You can just pawn off a classical algorithm when you're supposed to have a hybrid algorithm and things like that.

Which is starting to be many. They are more similar than they are different. So the differences are very technical and very subtle, and I hope that I can get them correct. I've done many revisions of these slides fixing nets. 4 of them this morning. So thank you to everyone who emailed me this morning and prompted those changes. Alright. Let's let's see. At least see if we can get this. So I'm gonna I'm gonna compare these 6 drafts, CFG chem combiners. That's mine. TLS hybrid design. That's, Stabila et al. CFR GPKP HPKE cyber? That's boss and Chris Wood. Lamb's composite cam. That's myself and my co author's openpgp. That's Aaron and Davros and Falco, I think. And then Jose hybrid encrypts. That's the Nokia guys. And I hope I get the details right. So I've tried to capture here the purpose of these drafts and the purpose column, there is an important distinction in that some of these are trying to achieve ephemeral key exchanges, and some of these are trying to achieve long lived encryption public keys. And I don't fully understand myself the extent to that matters for protocol design, but I think it is worth calling out whether it's meant to be single use or multi use public keys. The combiners look structurally different in a couple of cases, but as we go through the I'll go the, the actual constructions in detail, they actually are more similar then they look on this slide. But this is where they get this gets tricky because there's the footnotes have footnotes on on some of these things and their security property"

The bottom corner Josehybridincrip, that should be Kmac 250 that was a change made recently that get in these slides. Okay. Next. Next. Here's the other interesting one that I know Russ input as opinions about, is are the algorithm choices? Are the cipher suites aligned between working groups and Russ keeps making a point, which goes even a layer more subtleness, which is is there a are their APIs consistent? Have we done some dumb info string and the other one doesn't, that's gonna force the APIs to be different. And so my I'm pleasantly surprised this table is more aligned than I expected it was going to be when I putting these slides together. So generally speaking, the lamp stuff is a superset of the open PGP stuff, which is a superset of the TLS stuff, which is a superset of the the c the HPKE stuff. So it's mostly clean. Russ made a comment. He'd like this table to be smaller and fuller, but how to get consensus on that is an open question. One of the ones that's interesting here is the top line lapses the only group that considering RSA Based hybrids. And we think that's correct. We think that lamps is you know, CMS in particular S MIME I can this is public information. I can say that NTrust does not have a public eliptic curve based SMIME root. Because we've never been asked for it, no one has ever tried to buy that from us. And to me, that's a strong indication that the SMIME ecosystem isn't ready to to just say, you know, ECC is a thing we have. Now it's bolt PQ onto it."

And let's use that as our bridge. Then asking to implement ECC at the same time is is not accomplishing that, that goal of using a trusted code base. So Yeah. There are some differences in lapses I think is a superset probably for good reason because ex509 in general gets used very, very, very broadly. More broadly than anything else here. There's also a question that I've been asked a couple times, why not the 5.21 size elliptic curves. Fair question. So we've taken the 380 fours as the highest strength left the curve. I think that aligns with the CNSA. Document recommendations. So I, I think this is a defensible choice, I'm aware that there are potentially alignment, safer speed alignment discussions that are fully resolved yet. Or that will come up later because Paul doesn't know how to speak into the mic. Okay. Let's go I'll go through these 1 by 1. I don't know how much time I have you want me to go through the quickly. Okay. Let's go through these 1 by 1. Like that. So here's the oh, here's an aside. Yeah. Here's a quick aside. So let's talk about the NIST document SPA156 C rev 2. Which tells you how to do a KDF. How to go from key material to, to a symmetric key, and it's got this nice little sentence in it that says, this recommendation permit the use of a hybrid shared secret of the form zprime to z concatenated with t. Where Z gets you Fips security bit and tea gets you 0 of them, but you're allowed to put anything that's not considered security relevant in there, and that's okay. So this is great. This this allows us to say I've got a Fipps approved elliptic curve, which is my z at full bit strength, and I've got some other thing that I'm not claiming that security for, and we're gonna abuse that, and it's great."

And if, I think I think it's only for the hash construct you need to iterate and bump the counter each time. So we have taken this Exactly. Like, exactly into the the CFRgchem combiners draft. That if you implement c for existing providers directly, you are trivially compliant this nest back, your FIP certification should be trivially and easy. In fact, we even fixed the counter at 0.

It aims to be compatible with the NISTS back the cam PDF, it's seems to suitable for combining 2 or more. I think it's the only one that handles the case of or more.

And we are if the ciphertext or ciphertext and shared secrets are constant length, you can do it the first way. If they are not constant length I'm looking at you RSA, Kim. Then we want to have a right right length in coding, right encoded lengths thing just so you can't do length extension and type things. That was a trade off we made recently. We originally had an extra layer of hashing in here said, actually, we could do a length in coding instead of a hash and, like, it's just the same the instantiations provided are the K MAX and the Shaw Threes, but this draft does not provide concrete instantiations of the component. KEMs. So we're algorithm agnostic into which KEMs you're combining And I know there's discussion should there be a shot to instantiation. And currently, there is not. Daniel Gilmore, can you Yeah. Yeah. Does the fixed info contain an identifier for the particular combiner that's being used? I mean, are you committing to the algorithm that is in use here? EKG.

The construction is to just take the 2 things smush them together, feed it into HKDF extract. Sometime later, the whole transcript gets fed into HKDF attract including the ciphertext, which is an important bit of footnote. This also claims to be compatible with the KDF. This is very close to being an instantiation of CFG chem combiners. It includes the shared secrets and the CTs in cascading mode rather than in concatinies mode. It foregoes lengthencoding, And the argument there is because X2f509secp2 p256 and Kyber are all fixed licks. Okay. This is a great example of how we did the CFRG draft to be used. It's a it's It's like a checklist. It's an abstract sensation. It's a checklist. If you're gonna deviate from it, then you need to justify your deviations with a security argument. So this is I think this is, this is great. Scott. Just a quick, comment. The security of this depends very heavily on how did the that the full TLS, key derivation function and we'll certainly not be secure in in other contexts. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. The fact that this is an ephemeral key exchange is part of security justification here. I think that what was that your No. That is in femoral, but instead of how the, key driver of derivation stirs in, the various things that hashes the entire message. The transcript. Transcript. Yeah.

This one, I don't know if either boss or Chris would is here. Boss is not. Chris was here this week, not in the room. Okay. So this again is a really nice example of how to use the CFRG draft, they say we, you know, they explicitly acknowledge it and they see here are the ways we are different. The security consideration section explicitly lays out differences and explicitly justifies the differences. Maybe I'm gonna violate Paul's rules. I don't think that analysis is correct. You next slide, please? So this sentence in particular is the problematic one. So this statement was or is true. It is in fact a true statement. KIBER 768 draft 00, which is round 3, does mix in the cipher texts that is no longer true of ml him initial public draft. So if this is is bumped up to do the current FIP's draft standard, this sentence is no longer true. The other thing that gets really confusing is HPKE 9180 in its DH cam in caps commits the ciphertext. This draft defines a different caps that does not commit the cipher text. So you don't get it for free from the Peaky E layer, and you don't get it for free from mlchem. This is the sort of down in the weeds knit stuff that's, is different and really hard to align."

They have distinct authors groups. We've been working back closely together. So the instantiation is here as a subset of the lapsed 1. It behaves really quite similar. All the ways, I believe. Next, And then there's this Jose draft which again, is just a direct instantiation of CRFR GECOM Combiners with again, some subset of the algorithms. The I'm gonna put a footnote here that its authors probably don't want me to say, but I know there's some debate about whether Jose and Jose should should get hybrids through each HPKE or whether this do this draft, which finds them directly against CF regime. CFG chem Combiners. I'm gonna claim to not be an active participant of either of those working groups. I think you're presenting even later on this afternoon. So I expect that'll still come up at at the Jose Working Group But as far as alignment, I mean, it's you know, fully aligned was at my last slide. Have a summary slide? Yeah. Summary slide. Cool. The CPG chemical binary is intended to be an overkill construction. It's intended to be safe no matter how dumb your component chems are. Again, I'm looking at URSA. It we're intending that that's that protocols will instantiate it either take it directly or simplify it with, security consideration notes explaining why and how they've done so. And so all the ones we present so far, I think, are really good examples of doing that. The open question then becomes, if everyone is simplifying could we simplify the top level construction example, not you know, if we decide we don't need to for cyber text or we decide, you know, are there some could if all this everything that uses it simplifies Could you broken that up? And that's the discussion we could have."

So these are all actually far more closer aligned than I expected when I started doing these slides. Yeah. I don't think I've said this already.

Various working groups in the ICF to consider the fact that you have an installed base of SHOT 2. That exists today. Shot 3 is not deployed. Very many places.

In terms of, like, getting things approved. We would encourage the use of SHOT too. We feel that the security requirements when you did the development of both of these hashes.
