And and this is sort of hinting towards what you're gonna see on the last slide here. But In any case, the n common elements is essentially what I've used as the requirements they've got a rationale column them, but I... I've not put that in the idea here is essentially that you're likely to use this mapping document. In conjunction with one of the baseline requirements documents. So duplicating that kind of thing isn't really necessary the idea here is that the common element is essentially the key that you used to join those tables. The Iot reference examples column, of course is also not brought into that because it refers back two. You know, Ne had a bunch of other baseline requirements drafts. And So there's a a question. If we keep things as they are, this is likely to keep expanding. I would say that we'd probably go for adding in Etsy at the cybersecurity for consumer Iot devices, baseline requirements,"

Maybe we don't have quite the right structure here. I wonder if maybe what we should consider is producing a mapping draft. For each one of the mapping that we want to do. And essentially what I have in mind here is that. These drafts we were to do it that way, wouldn't have to be the living draft concept that we talked about previously because each one of these requirements draft. Or documents that we bring in externally. Seems to be pretty long lived. So in that in that sort of scenario, we'd need a mapping document. For each one of those drafts. Means a lot more draft that we'd be producing But at the same time, each of them would give an implement a guide to go from one set of requirements to the F and and related technologies that they need to be able to implement that. I think that that's a way to keep the complexity manageable because if we start trying to bring in, all these different technologies, it's going to band, it's gonna end up pretty big. So I'm a little bit nervous to start in on, you know, a thing that could easily end up being a hundred page draft as it grows over time. As opposed to several small drafts that"

Number comments on the in the adoption call about key in ad hoc, this is actually also true for C don't think it adds so much to add different table to that. The difference are quite small bigger impact would be bigger of the assumptions, the bigger impact is lifting up D details as in in several records flight two.

Score. So Do you think that there's gonna be difficulty in mapping all kinds of transport layers. That might add overhead to that are now being discussed, for example, all get and things like that. So the document doesn't really talk about any of the very little about the lower layers.

But it might be useful to have a table equal the table a column about when is not used with any security protocols, what what is the overhead? As well. So the reason I'm saying this is also because if you're using Tls, or any versions of The or any of the transport protocol that is based on Tcp. There is also a Dc ahead. As opposed to not using Tcp and just udp. Yeah. I think if you if you take this document this yes. The the current numbers in the document is the... If you add details or Tls or Os or ad hoc, on top of what you have, this is the number of extra bites you get So not sure it fits or how many bytes having the lower layers this might be trigger might depend on your network but But anyway, the Tcp connection establishment is part of the Security Association also.

So example corp dot com. And naturally have to protect your root certificate and private key. Support the rev verification and rei of certificates as needed. And you probably have a long duration, self signed route certificate or the C sign routes for certificate so that you don't have to worry about turn on the network every time you you you re key then the the whole network has to recover from that.

So You. You you have to kind of be comfortable with less than perfect security. And we talked a bit about, you know, whether or not browsers could somehow indicate when you're on the embedded web or interface that this is not a C science certificate But you know, the the research with with, you know, handling Evs certificates didn't turn up any anything useful from that kind of user experience.

So that's all I have aside from the draft there, which you're free to read and I guess we can go on to some questions."

That is going to be a a very big problem I think that we need a very concrete way to overcome it. I I actually think that it's... It might be simpler than it at first appears. I think that the the identity of the acne server is act actually the network identity. I think that's all there is to it. If the identity of the the acne server changes, you're on a different network. And maybe that's the way to to handle it. Network identity. Is ac server identity, and there's nothing else to it. Beyond that, If you make any other... If you take any other attack it looks to me like, there are some pretty big security issues need to be overcome. But but if you take that specific tag, it should be fine. Yeah. Have happy to... If you've got ideas on other ways to get around that, but I I think that's That's actually the you know, the best idea I've heard so far. So Okay. Yeah.

Without in local certificate game that installed and browser, you replace don't click that message with install some certificate your certificate which is intentionally made most scary than paid this much deal basis. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, catch twenty two I have I have some some interest expressed from the major Os vendors, but no no concrete promises And I think they're waiting for me to finish prototyping before they they go any further. So Yeah. That's that's kinda where it stands right now, there's interest but kind of cautious. And I think part of it goes back to do we deal with network identity and I like the idea of ac server identity? Fixes that. And and then some practical issues on on the on the back end, how do you flush out the trust route when you're not connected to that network. I'll I'll come back to to local local locality in the in the second question, but to me the important point here is you plan to go through the the operating systems and hope that the browsers would used the certificate store. That the operating Yes is lot. Oh, yes. So the second point for me is given that the topic of proving that we are currently in this local network and that we have same idea of the right ecm server is rather hard. I'd like raise the question whether it is actually useful. So what I'm talking to printer, I'm connecting to it via some identifier Is it so really useful to be sure that I'm talking to a printer that is"

To have to have vendor zones basically vendor domains in which a device to which your device can connect ideal in some cases online if internet connections are available that us. And get some name like print printer one two three four five six seven, but printers dot some vendor dot com. And that it could get signed with something that is already in the browser store. And that is completely accessible to the to the user. It also gives the green checkbox box. It doesn't say it's local, but then again, that green checkbox box as you outlined earlier, I will not make any different statement then we have green checkbox. So why will require that look locality at all it neither gives us added user experience, that contributes to the act the use available security. And if it makes things more complicated then, asking online. So two two issues, and we've we've had this discussion in the printer working group as well. My Ought be politically correct about this? The the level of expertise and and and some of these security technologies isn't necessarily what we would want it to be for individual vendors to implement that kind of a solution where they are issuing certificates and also responding to Dns request.

But I'm thinking about the cases of I'm setting up something that I don't want to use expertise with. And then I get running without having an enterprise setup. Yeah. I think my my concern and and and we've had had these discussions in the printer working group as well as is it's a big ask to get printer manufacturers and yeah. Yeah. More widely, any Iot device manufacturer to provide an acne service or something like it and a dynamic Dns service. In order for the printer to be discover and usable. And then on top of that, and generally speaking, unless you're in an enterprise, you're using multi cast Dns and and Dns service discovery to to find and use a printer in the home. And the goal there is you have a that local name and The only place you're gonna get a a resolution on that name is via s.

West Frederick isi and I can board, but speaking with no hands. So I I I I like the idea I wish this problem was simpler to solve. I was in best by the other day, and I was trying to hit a button on a refrigerator and it kept popping up this error saying certificate invalid on that stupid little display panel. Which is sort of a canon related I I think that there's a lot of security related things that are gonna pop up this make this harder and harder and just the few that I were, you know, thinking of, I understand the proposal, you know, is even privilege differences between devices in our local network may be trained to steal a certificate for another device or some like that or re brand under, you know, a different name. What's preventing me from coming into you know, a a household or whatever. And then for for claiming that I'm something that I know I wanna steal, you know, a password from somebody else and that that may work okay in a home network because you're only gonna trust your friends. I don't know how this will interestingly play with stuff on a public network and a coffee shop where I can spin up an ac server and and, you know, proclaimed to be the acne server for the network and let alone fight with another ac server.

Tom Eric this is something that should be sold as probably hard. Just the comment like these self science routes certificates the level of trust necessary reduce like basically, all the room so that get all ourselves sign. And don't also don't understand you mean with this. Like, the browse current browser situation where you have, like, thousands and thousands of different c that can... That's not really the the chemical of or of trust. It's quite... It's what they have is by the dad. Yeah. For example, we had, like, trust score a couple of months ago, what's realized they had, like the post address to see in some seven eleven or something. Basically, you see it didn't really existed towards owned by some nation state. And also, like, if you have if I have my network, I make self sign route see it and that's the only thing that's trusted. That's a much higher level of trust what you get in the browser. The difference is that you you get a warning in the browser. That's a problem, but it's not really indication of how much the level of trust you have. No not at all."

So there's a a question I wanna pose and I think we're not able to answer it. Then I don't know what we can do with this. And the question is if you had a device on your network that was intent on stealing your banking credentials. Would you be able to stop it? Now when I say intent, I mean, it is pretending to be your bank is showing you your bank's page your login page, and it's really just a pipe through. It's acting as a man in the middle. So... Sorry. An on path attacker. So you've got non path attacker on your network because one of your devices has been compromised you go to log in and Think about grammar. you know, don't don't think about you or me. Grandma was trying to connect to the printer, but Grandma is now looking at our bank login page. What happens next. If we don't have an answer for that, don't think we can really do much. So I I think that bears a lot of thinking about because in this scenario, that that attacker gets their little green check Mark, and everything's fine. So I I do think there's... You know, if if the local ac server has issued a certificate for something called printer dot local, and then another printer dot local comes out and says want a certificate and and And here's my information."

So I I totally appreciate that. I'm talking about the compromised printer. Not a a spur printer. A compromised one. Okay. So we compromise the credentials of the printer Not the credentials. Or the more private key and the certificate there. And and so we can imp the the the printer. Again, our attacker has code running on the printer And assuming no. all to be other things. Okay. So you just run up and run your own code on the printer. Okay. That's right. So we do that. And quite frankly, whether using Ac with a local server and self sign certificate or a C signed certificate the problem is the same. You've compromised the printer and now you're able to do things with it. And that isn't a problem that This draft can solve or any draft solve. It's it's a problem with the software and the protections of the printer. So maybe this solution. Maybe this is a problem that I'm thinking of. Yeah Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Right. Thank you, Michael. This was very interesting. Presentation. Thank you. Yeah. We'll will come back to you about design team and all of this work.

So power of attorney based authorization or based authorization is an authorization technique where the user can grant their or delegate their power to their trusted the device and so that the device can work on behalf of the user. So we were, like, are thinking like, how do we use this authorization technique to on onboard It devices. So in this proposed draft. We have, like, different parties like, Principle, and onboarding controller, the the device and the certificate authority. So the principals send a Po to the device so that the device can onboard to the to the local cloud. You via the onboarding controller. And so the main updates for at this time is that maybe slide Please Yeah. So with our discussions regarding like there the clarification of the features of the based authorization in the draft.

So we were actually doing everything in J format and and discussions that you are using constraint devices. This is for Iot devices so you need sea. Yes we agreed to that and we have considered sea and it's also clarified in the draft. Next slide, please. Yep. There were some comments in verification of the B, which is We have... We have some solutions we don't know if that's the optimal one.

And we were like talking about how to interpret the. How do the device or the onboarding controller can actually interpret or how it can be decode and validated at the other vendor the principal generation and send it to the device. So this can be done as similar to Pg. So you can download an image or a library in your local machine or yeah, at your entity, this client or I mean, out device or the onboarding download the library or image and can validate or by themselves.
