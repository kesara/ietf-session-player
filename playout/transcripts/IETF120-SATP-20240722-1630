So the way we always organize our meetings or the core documents always get first priority and then the stage zero is sort of some preliminary discussions about what's happening that really occurs before the protocol actually takes over and that's certainly one of the bounds for future work but it's not technically in our charter today, but we have plenty of time to discuss it and it has actually affected stuff our scope as I mentioned we have this notion of asset networks that have a network one on one side and network two on another We are not standardizing anything that has this notion of asset networks that have a network one on one side and network two on another. We are not standardizing anything that happens within the networks. We expect to gateway to sit on the edge, and we are really talking about the protocol between those two gateways wherever possible. Obviously, there's interactions that happen in networks that we have to consider, but we are not standardizing and there's different types of networks that may exist Our esteemed area director, worry, raise your hand he is the area director for the whole area that we are sitting in and he requested that we review our sat He is the area director for the whole area that we are sitting in, and he requested that we review our SAPP milestones because guess what? They're due today And we haven't succeeded in that. Don't worry. No IETF manages to ever get their milestones done on time But it is time to reevaluate and figure out, okay, if we're going to adjust the dates, what are we going to do? those to be? So in the beginning, we actually promised the use case document to finish first and actually that's received, you know, so many various bits of input and suggestions that it's trailing behind a little bit because everybody's been concentrating on the architecture and the asset protocol documents"

Yeah I think we have a good collection of use cases which cover all the scenarios that we wanted to showcase as compelling for the architecture that you've laid out in the architecture document and also many of those scenarios have the direct application of the SAPP core protocol. Some of the scenarios present examples which are, which need protocols that are not even covered by the SATP charter yet, but which we hopefully will cover it on future date because those are necessary for two networks to interoperate and share assets with each other. So I think we are in pretty good shape of the use cases. The only question is whether the community feels that we use cases are compelling and we whether we need use cases drawn from other fields besides the ones that are highlighted in the document. Maybe we can get into that when I'm present I'm actually having a hard time hearing you because the echoing in sitting in the chairroom the speakers are faced away from me, but what I didn't hear is what I don't think I heard was actually a time can you give"

That's very safe, yeah Corey, go ahead, our esteemed area direction is going to answer all questions I, orie steele, responsible at area director for SADP Usually the milestones are target the date at which you would deliver the document to me as responsible AD and then if assuming everything's going to well, I'll bring it forth to the IESG. So I would think about like finishing your document, you're working group activity should be completed by the date that you set in the Datatracker and I can do a early area director reviews if you want but usually I will like take a look at the document at that point That's it reviews if you want. But usually I will take a look at the document at that point when you set. Great, thank you very much. Yeah, so it's getting through working group last call, being done with it and saying, we're ready to deliver it and then it'll go through a lengthy idea wide last call where a bunch of people that had not ever read the document before will review it and then tell us we've worked to deliver it, and then it'll go through a lengthy IETF wide last call where a bunch of people that had not ever read the document before will review it and then tell us we're, of course, kidding But we get lots more feedback from the entire rest of the community as well as the IESG as they review it as well as a bunch of directorate reviews I did request a couple of early directorate reviews so you saw a review from the security directorate and the HTTP directorate actually gave us"

That being said we may beat that and that would be fantastic and then at some point we'll work with Forie on rechartering.

Let me share your slides Yeah, I can draw the slides.

And so if you look at what we have today basically actually can move at one slight probably nicer to see it Yeah So this is stage, stage one. So basically the first message is saying, look, we've had all this complex refifications in stage zero This is the set of parameters. This is the pointer to the asset ID, this is the set. So basically, message 1.1 is a essentially confirming. Here's what we agreed in stage 0, right? And so in message 1.2 gateway 2 can says can say you message 1.1 is essentially confirming here's what we agreed in stage zero right and so in message 1.2 gateway 2 can say yes perfect we've aligned perfectly on everything, and then, however, there's always an out so gateway 2 can say you know what for some reason that's, it's not on a board For some reason, I don't want to proceed. So there's always an opportunity in 1.2 for Gateway 2 to say no proceed, for policy reasons, whatever reason terminate gracefully there's this there's an opportunity in 1.2 for Gateway through to say no proceed from policy reasons whatever reason terminate gracefully it's not on a board right this is the important thing now if both sides decide to proceed, then this is when really the handshake starts Transfer commence and act commends And in 1.2, the transfer proposed receipt is actually a signature on all"

Keep on going, because this is just verbating what I just said. Okay, so next, next item, updating the figure. So a lot time ago, we actually had something like this where the application could talk to the DLT, the network as a client, you know, submitting some kind of a you know, anything from, you know, token, transaction whatever And then the other option is for the application to talk directly to the gateway itself, literally through an API. And that's, we're going to talk about the APIs in a little bit And so this is useful and thank you, Dennis, for pointing this out, bringing us back to the original figure. This provides us with interesting use cases such as this views so for those who don't have, don't expect people have read this views draft, but the idea in views is that an entity or the beneficiary in Network 2 is needing information about the state of the asset in Network 1, and it's a private close network. So there needs to be a cryptographic mechanism to do this. That's the views draft future work, but what happens there is really the benefit needs to ask Gateway 2 to ask it gateway one for the views right so it's a direct that the request is coming from"

The API that we're dealing with now is what we call API 2, but for this, for this direction between an application to the gateway, it is API 1, just for those who are interested Paul has a question question Paul paul hoffman I'm very concerned about the architecture changing now for something that is a draft that's not even adopted yet in the working group I, uh, so something that's adding the arrow, an extra arrow. Well, it's not just adding the arrow. It is, in fact, an addition API that hasn't been specified When I see this, when so to some extent, you're right, it is adding though when I see that a client now has two ways of talking to two very different objects, that seems to me to be significant architectural difference, and we don't know how that's going to happen later. So is that really an appropriate thing to do in the architecture now? Or to when the other document is adopted? to then change the architecture? So in the core document, which is the next presentation, it's actually there with an API 1 API 2 API 3 The discussion about APIs have been moved to the appendix. So we've been, this is why it was a correction. In fact, we've always looked at it this way. It just got, this diagram got dropped off for some reason it was Dennis who about two months ago said you know what we are We are doing this, but your architecture is not showing it"

No, I understand that but it sounded like from what you were saying, in fact, this was a change to the architecture. It's just a bringing the architecture in line with the core. That's right you. So one, if I may, one Claire, of some history of the working group is there was a lot of stuff that I think people have interest in working on here but the negotiation with the IESG to get this off the ground was we minimize our work into sort of the core protocol between the two gateways But there are requirements that the core protocol will impose upon implementation in, you know, within a network. So you know, one of the things discussed a lot was possibly the legal ramifications of what we expect these two networks to, you know, actually have some sort of legal agreement, you know, so that it falls back to the court system or something when transactions fail or things like that Or we require that a network have the ability for a gateway to lock an asset. We don't describe how right? We don't say, you know, you must use an HTTP-based, rest-based API we just say there should be some sort of, you know, some sort of API with these requirements in order for, you know, the security data be sort of backed up in between. So we're trying to slice it into different groups where right now we're only talking between the two networks but there are ramifications of how that ripples out into other parts of the architecture So it has made it very tricky how we stick with our with our charter requirements without stepping over those bounds and yet still impose some requirements in that in the IETF we often come back and maybe need to make some changes in the future. Hopefully we won't have to"

So, so, uh, long time, we've had context ID and session ID listed in the core spec without actually saying what context ID was. Session ID we said from the beginning, well, that's a session sort of numbering, you know, unique number, maybe it's a random number that is only shared between Gateway 1 and Gateway 2 and simplicity gateway one chooses it and this is the same way that, you know, if you look at all the older protocol I Ike, V1, Ike, 2, one site chooses a random number, and it's discarded, forget it after the session terminates. But there's this bigger question that in stage zero the thing that kickstarts Sati assumed to be a couple of applications. And so there are cases, as we've discussed in the group where there's this existing context ID thing that's floating even before Sat-P kicks in and somehow you need to bind this down to the to that instance so this is but the way, how context ideas drive, it's still out of scope but this is kind of a sort of a direct pointer to what's going to be in the future way, how context ideas drive, it's still out of scope, but this is kind of a sort of a direct pointer to what's going to be, you know, in the future. So I think I have a diagram thank you so so this is kind of people are like, why do wen lin the context study? Well, uh, those who are who are familiar with the European Union you know, myca regulation on the different assets, I've used that as example here.

But for us here, we need a content ID that persists across sessions and is independent of the session ID Can I restate that? and you tell me if I got it right? So there is a notion where the two entities need to know that these things are sort of part of the common set But the important thing is that in terms of our charter is right now if one succeeds in the other failures we can't do anything about it because that's out of scope of the current charter and we'll figure out how to bind them together later. That's right. Okay, thank you So just a bit of background. What's context ID? This is very high level. We're not saying how to compute it, how to derive it, how do you communicate it to the gateways I think next slide is a pointer to so, so, okay, it's in core If you look at one of our documents, there's already, Dennis you can you can put that on the chat there's only a link to some early thoughts about what this needs to be. And I think in some of a couple of the previous interim meetings, Dennis has had a diagram that all this stuff going from application one, application two to application one context ideas push down to the gateways and then Sati kicks in, right?

So once you finish this, this is essentially the two-face commit, actually two and a half phase commit so the three-phase but with one arrow removed, it's a three-phase commit protocol that gets guarantees you know that the assets are going to be the networks are going to be um uh consistent. Your second question, yeah, this is, this is why it was in the art area. I think originally we were trying, we went first to security area and the same almost verbatium.

No questions next move on, no question, the next draft, which is so let's stop here for one sec before we shift topics So from the working group requirements point of view what do you see is left that needs to be wrapped up before we turn it over to the age?

It's more like, explain it, but you know, why are you, you know, doing it? So expanding on a few descriptions right, okay, all right, that sounds good then you're ready to shift so we will do so So this is core, which is the actual protocol itself move on. So, so as before we have, you know, when we changed, when we decided, well, all the stage zero negotiations needed to be out before stage one same thing now in court In fact, I think we fixed score first and only realized that on, oh, we haven't updated the architecture, just move the entire subsection up, so that's actually next slide please So for those who are new to this and you're wondering, like what is the guys talking about stage zero stage so the yellow that you see here is out of scope for us. It's actually quite complex. So in fact, for example, identity managed this is a big issue now with the, so at the global financial level, there's this financial action task force headquartered in Vienna that basically regulates all the international wire transfers It does this, you know, anti-money laundering and so on and so on and they haven't figured out you know, particularly with blockchains coming out of the picture How do I verify, you know, so Hannah says he's he's got a public key on, you know, Ethereum How do I know that, right?

So I presume, you know, gateways are run by somebody It's not just an anonymous sort of thing And it could be that, you know, a bank could be gate gateway operator in the banking space.

And so how do I need that I want that network, not this other network? More interestingly, for those who want the gory detail when Ethereum, the creators of Ethereum, created Ethereum, they enumerated the Net, TestNet, and so on in a very trivial identifier structure And so after the fork, for those you know, the fork history, there was a case where when you do ryan cross network transfer into the Ethereum network, there could be a probability that probably not zero that your transaction ends up in the wrong fork Why?

I will say that we had not considered binding them, but they been progressing at the same time, and they're both nearly ready at the same time.

So I think what I will do Paul, is claire baldi I will work with Ori on what he thinks about that situation as well unless Orii wants to speak to it today I'm just thinking as someone who might be asked, like during IETF last call, can you please review? this one document? That would suck because I wouldn't know, not only are there in, you know, bindings between the two, they're not stated I just heard some of them this morning They're, you know, like, like they're verbal. They're not stated in the document like in core saying, you need to understand this thing about architecture where it's you know said to be out of scope.

That's the core document reference core document of the architecture document. That's the core document refers to the architecture, but it's not the other way around, right, Thomas? That's what I've been seeing also the an architecture document was written it was meant to have a broader scope there what is strictly needed for this app be core protocol so if you read the architecture document, it defines, a particular set of modules It defines a modular architecture that is used for interoperability between any two systems that are maintaining digital assets And you see there are some different kinds of interoperability modes that are talked about there and"

But there are also other modes that we have defined called asset exchange and data sharing. Asset exchange is of course asset transfer which is right at the top but there are also other modes that we have defined called asset exchange and data sharing. Asset exchange does not require an asset to actually move from one network to another but it still requires exchange of assets happening atomically into separate networks Data sharing is about communicating state in one network to another So if two networks are running business policies that are inter network to another. So if two networks are running business policies that are interlinked in the real world, they may need to know what's going on in the business process in a different network so at that point you need to know we need a protocol whereby one network can query another network and find out some information and then verify that the information is actually authentically sourced from the network they are requesting. The logic of this classification is indicated at the right that you see it's if you think of these systems as glorified data requesting the logic of this classification is indicated at the right that you see it's if you think of these systems as glorified databases the asset transfers and asset exchanges are involved atomic operations that is their bi-direction dependencies where there's some state changes happening in both networks that had to happen simultaneously for the integration of the transaction whereas the data sharing or the data transfer is where some you read shade from one network and that triggers some kind of change update in another network These are speaking in very generic terms. So the use cases draft what we're trying to do is we're trying to exemplify various combinations of these operations in practice scenarios so that we can we can show everybody that"

Yeah, sure So one of the early use cases that was heavily discussed and desired and declared out of scope and the beginning with the bill of lading that's that's your third example here, is that, am I reading it right? So the bill of leading example is it is not the the way the use cases draft talks about it is it refers to it as being either a you can either share a bill of lading using a data sharing which is out of scope but you can also think of the bill of lading as being a digital asset which needs to be moved from one network to another And if you do that, then you will need SAPIC code Okay, thank you you So the additions that have been made have been made since I IETF 117, that was exactly a year ago and there were new and compelling use cases that were suggested by Zayna and Victor Zau and Dr. Peter Liu, who I think is in the audience here And there were several discussions in the sat we made Peter Liu, who I think is in the audience here. And there were several discussions in the Satvi mailing list from in the latter part of last year until early this year So we ended up adding three new use cases Two of those use cases cover the existing interoperative modes that I talked about in the previous slide And they slot into broad application areas that we had already defined in the use cases draft prior to IETF on 17. And but we still added these use cases because they illustrate new scenarios that show that SATP"

So I'll mention that again two sides from now. Next slide, this slide is. So just covering the various sections. So each section from three up to six covers broadly a different field of application Section 3 covers the area of international trade and supply chains and for almost the past decade, there's been a lot of work going on that's happened in the field, in the real world in building networks that specialize in different parts of supply chains or different parts of international trade, such as one network just comprises of participants that have that are running a trade finance contract, there's a different network just manages supply chain logistics, a different network manages just K by C and so on So there are use cases there we've talked about which need SAPP and the SAPP core as well as other kinds of more SAPP modes in order to enable those networks to interoperate to be able to share data to be able to move assets across each other.

And there's been a lot of talk about interoperability because it's really a core requirement again as in the trade and supply chain's case you have here networks that specialize in something particular, like in the CBDC case, you have networks that just manage wholesale CBTC and other networks that just managed retail CBDC. So not going to go to the details, but if you look at the draft, you'll find some definitions and links And decentralized finance involves other networks which specialize purely in managing particular financial instruments like securities. So if you want for example, to be able to transfer securities from one network to another, or you want to be able to do a delivery versus payment of securities in one network in exchange for some central bank currency in another network, you will need a protocol either like Satpikor or something which is an option of that. And at the bottom left, you see there's an example of something that we actually implemented about three years ago This is part of an experiment conducted exploring the possibility for digital use and this is built by AASM in the IBM team for folks from IBM research developed proof of concept for the Bank of France and HSBC who each had a network managing digital assets One of them was running a ledger technology called Habelagia Fabric, another was running a legit technology called Corp and we used what was then called the Weaver Interoperability Tool, but which is now part of Hypoena Act-Type.

So that's the use case you added there. Next slide, please So in Section 5, the had, we were talking about gently speaking, decentralized commerce, that is commerce in, uh, various tokenized assets happening in a decentralized manner, and that of course, uses different networks, it relies on different networks running either blockchains or distributed ledge technologies of other kinds and the goal of such decentralized commerce, very broadly speaking is, you want to be able to sell and obtain payment for goods that are tokenized goods and services that are tokenized across these kinds of networks Some of these networks just manage content some other networks that manage the payment, potentially can think of designing a system if you're doing some scratch, which manage all of these things But in reality, what you've seen happening over the past decade is that you have several networks which do specialize in particular areas. And they specialize in managing particular kinds of digital assets They want to have a group of members. They don't necessarily want to have a group of members open like the Ethereum main network. And that's why we actually need these protocols like like Satp to any ensure that they can interoperate.

At the right you see we added a separate new section and this is referring to the the last use case that I related to a couple of slides ago where if you think about existing internet protocols, there may be ways to augment their levels of trust in the more decentralized internet that a lot of people think is emerging And what we can do as an example is think of the DNS protocol and it's associated EPP protocol, which allows, which any enables resource records to be moved from one registrar to another So if you have owners of particular resources, like second level domain names, potentially the second level domain names can be took tokenized or or monetized and they can be maintained in different distributed ledger networks These, what are these networks comprised of? These networks could be could have as their numbers, different registrars like Squarespace or GoDaddy as well as top level domain registries like Veri sign and they could be running smart contracts which which maintain the authentic copies of those resource records and the clients of those networks would be the registrants who actually end up owning the SLDs.

So this is in this example also kind of illustration the fact that stage zero, which Thomas talked about, earlier, which is out of scope of SAPPT protocol is really the place where you can fit in a lot of existing protocol which create a transaction context and once the transaction context is created, and the transaction context is really an intent to transfer once that is created the SAPP core protocol, which really covers stages one two three four or one to three that is really executing that particular intent.

That's probably the most common shared state in financial services And so I would just offer one bit of advice that within the use case documents, get more use cases, and I'm happy to obviously contribute to this more use cases which don't focus on the DLT blockchain layer, but look at this area where you have a lot of, you know the vast majority of cases go through Really, I'm really encouraged by the work that's been done.

And so you're 100% spot on and the problem is the newer ideas that everybody is talking about are distributed ledgers and other things, but it absolutely, if we could get some more examples in the document for traditional mechanisms that would be augmented, you know, by this would I would also shy away from them being called traditional or legacy, because in fact, huge amount of innovation going into cloud-based"

Obviously, a lot of them doing research there. They're moving from on-premise old-style ledgers to cloud-based ledgers.

So you cannot have a situation where you under up burning an acid in one system transfer so you cannot have a situation where you end up burning an acid in one in one system and it fails to get recreate another or you cannot have a situation where that asset gets replicated in both systems because it was unable to be deleted in the first system so that is really about the security challenge we are talking about for the lower security mechanisms, like when it comes to confidential communication between the gateways, we are relying on systems like or existing protocols like TLS but when it comes to ensuring that gate are available and there is a the failure, you know, which is you can existing protocols like TLS. But when it comes to ensuring that gateways are available and there is the failure, you can think of as a reliability issue really there are drafts there in the SAPP page if you can take a look so it sounds I think you're trying to see it So, so, so in fact we had a whole discussion about under the mailing list and interim meeting about threats to what happens so it's not about, you know, the communication security, maybe I misunderstood you, but things like, well, what happened? if gateway one is cheating? or Gateway 3 is cheating? Cheating here means that Gateway 1, you know, proceeds with all the trans- in it, that last sort of pre-commitments stage, which is I think Flow 3.4 it aborts, right? It boards the transaction and it basically goes silent. What that does it is can exhaust the resources at Gateway 2 because Gateway 2 is already doing some pre-commitment stage, right?

I will I'll preface that, you know, use case documents in the IETF do not necessarily these problems are solved exclusively with this technology, right? It's that the SATP are architecture and protocol can be used to solve the bigger problem that may need other competences.

Certain areas directors get very grumpy at 300-page documents yet Yeah, I mean that's actually a really good question So Thomas asked about, you know, succinctness and we don't like to be overly verbose We tend to prefer short and concise documents without going into great limits.

So I think when you develop your use cases documents, you want each use case to cover a interesting area where the protocol is relevant It's maybe not the only way to solve that problem space, but each use case that you describe should be concisely described and distinct and you want to avoid many use cases that are essentially saying the same thing.

There is a URL. I don't know where I can show I can share screen I can So I sent you the URL It was a private message before So basically it's stage zero"

So just to connect with what we discussed before in SATPi, core, we deal dealing with the strict interoperability or interchange between Gateway 1 and Gateway 2 So there is a yeah, that's the only diagram that I would like to discuss a bit here However, I mean, if we see the architecture, and the overall approach of SATP, there are six entities that need somehow to coordinate It's the application one with energy network one and gateway one and on the other side this application two with gateway two and network two So the whole discussion about how do we prepare SATP to run is about how do we establish what we said before as the transfer context between this six and entities, basically. So although stage zero is outside the scope of SATP, the idea here is to cover what should happen before the three phase of the SAPP protocol So as we see here, the intent of stage zero it's first of all, and I will go through the diagrams. As you see after, number 9, there is the sad peak and I will go through the diagrams. As you see after number nine, there is the SATP core execution, so where it's the SATP core comes into play. But before what, stage zero? is about is to first of all, from the application side, the intent is to transfer, for example, an asset from Alice to Bob in application two So the idea here is to from the application to go to the gateway"

Therefore, the network should have a notion of what is the transfer context that is requesting the transfer of these assets So there is this binding, number one, and there is the request of the transfer excuse me the transfer context from application to get gateway one, and then there is the binding of the assets in Network 1 One. And then there is the application to application communication communication which is the propagation of this transfer context from application 1 to application 2 two. From that moment on the application two knows about the transfer, and there is the same thing about binding the transfer context to the specific network to assets, and then propagate the transfer context in Gateway 2 and then there is the binding between Gateway 2, again Gateway 1, which is around number 8 there from that moment on all the 6 six entities have established the relevant connections so then SATP can trigger and that's number nine and then we have the execution of SATP and at the end we can have whatever is, you know, the completion is, roll back or commit and we can actually fetch the result in from 10 to you know the completion is roll back or commit and we can actually fetch the the result in from from 10 to number 13 so as we see here one of the the core elements of this whole transfer is the context"

So that's, you know, in a nutshell I don't want to say more, I mean, I'd prefer to answer two questions, but just to relate to what we discuss stage zero is something that, you know, establish this context of information about all the six entities that are participating in SADP. And in the transfer context, it a data structure, a complex data structure with a unique immutable ID that points to the different things that are necessary for this six entities to operate All right Thanks for the good description. That makes a clear sense to me Does anybody have questions or comments? for Dennis? David? hayes I was just running on the flow diagram on step four. How does that? message get from app one to app two? So this is typically something that is between applications so if alice wants to transfer to bob there should be some some way of you know reaching Bob and saying here's the intent to transfer something assets from me to you or Bob request"

Thank you we're going to leave that undefined Well, there should be the application level, you know, communications there could vary, could be, you know, from any sort of communication between applications. The only thing that actually we are somehow defining here is the kind of data should flow from application one to application two Now the protocol and the way that this is thing happens, it's something that it's still outside the scope of stage zero Okay From a working group perspective we are trying to charter P pieces that then can be you know, used as the core training and other things can be agreed upon you know, out of time or earlier or through whether they're an interoperability matter mechanisms or not, as long as they've come to the agreement protocol can actually make use in execute that transfer And it may be in the future we want to standardize a common way to do it but it's not actually required to be interoperable is that fair dennis yes absolutely All right Yeah, just a couple of comments Firstly, I think this context is really important, and I know that you've been told we shouldn't do things which are out of scope but when we don't have to look too far ahead to see that certain transactions are going"

I think Dennis has done a great job in sort of putting forward some drafts of what it might look like and then the second point is typically the parties, so app one and app two will get to know about transactions through something which is out of bounds so in in say finance, where I'm working, you might have an extra two, will get to know about transactions through something which is out of bounds. So in, say, finance, where I'm working, you might have an exchange, which basically says, okay, party A and party B have both agreed to, you know, sell the token or this share for this amount of money That is then communicated debts separately to app on and out and apt two by the exchange so that when you go to the settlement process of saying, okay, let's now execute this transaction those two apps will already know about that through having it being communicated from a agreed transaction on an exchange That's all that might be useful to mention that and there's maybe one thing that we should another one that we should put in the picture is the fact that besides the semantics of what we are transferring there is also some technical challenges that we have to address Typically, if we have a locking of us assets for one SATP transfer instance, that might be like, a pessimistic blocking databases. I mean, we take a hard lock on the, and if this transfer fails, I mean, we have to"

But there might be other like, more optimistic ways of approaching so you can have many concurrent gateway claims to transfer assets in the same assets in the network. So by having this transfer con- of approaching. So you can have many concurrent gateway claims to transfer assets in the same assets in the network. So by having this transfer context, we can mention and point to the different transfers So if one succeeds, the other would fail and the network should know about that. And which gateways are in concurrency for the transfer of specific assets Maybe it's too early to discuss about that, but the fact that we have a transfer context might allow us to, you know, more easily address this kind of challenges All right. Thank you, Ned ned smith, Intel. I wonder if you can give me some interesting about what it means to bind assets to a network I think I understand if I can get my arms around the idea of binding an application to an end point. A single in endpoint. What does it mean to bind to? Yeah. Typically, there is some sort of state that they should be, you know, in the life cycle of assets like a reserved for specific transfer So if the network knows about the transfer context, you can, you know, set somehow the list eventually of transfers that actually are concurrent accessing, concurrently accessing the specific assets in the network. So there is sort of a life cycle of the asset inside the network somehow implicit to all of these. So somebody requested to transfer the asset. There is one of the gate that succeed to transfer it, and then eventually the asset is moved. So if it is a DLT behind, then we can, we have to burn or extinguish the asset somehow, or even in the database then we should point on pointer on the asset transfer to the remote network. So this"

    "text": "notion of binding is the fact that inside a transfer, the specific asset is related to the specific transfer context So we can trace what happened even later on when the completion of the protocol is performed so if it is rolled back or committed so we can trace eventually the assets Can I jump in also, Ned? So there's this problem. We say bind, maybe it's an the non-traditional use of bind, but when you have a bunch of assets that's all lined up to be part of a context, there must be a way somehow for the network to know, don't allow anything else to happen to this. And we've been saying wrong so far without saying how to actually do the lock. So application can't do a lock because the lock is kind of a network function so we've been using the word bind we might end up finding some other word but I know what you mean. Typically, we say application bind to the end point yeah so if I'm yeah, if I might follow up what what Thomas said. I mean, if we go back to the traditional database, it's a lock intention here, the binding i think that term network is throwing me off a bit I think the network as, you know, like a, you know, IP as a network Yeah. Or, but you sort of off a bit. I think of a network as, you know, like a, you know, IP as a network. Yeah. Or, but certainly a collection of nodes or in a, you know can be a network. It seems like it's a little bit you know, higher level obstruction. Yeah Chair hat on here. One thing that we agreed to over a year ago was to try and call it an asset network because it's not, and you know, unfortunately we're in the IETA, and anytime somebody hears the word network and we saw that in some of the reviews that we got from the security director and stuff that they were confused as you're not alone there and that's our fault.

Thank you All right, that brings us actually to the end of the agenda, and we actually went over the hour and a half so I'm glad we got the two-hour limit, even though we only went over by six minutes. There is a slot for any other business, so if anybody else has things you want to bring up or discuss now is the time Otherwise, we will wrap up It's been a good discussion today I will Claire I just wanted to second that and say it's really good to see a meeting so involved and with so many people willing to share their thoughts and opinions. So I wanted to thank everyone for taking part Yeah. One other comment it's sort of rare that IETI working groups get into news articles and this working group has gotten into multiple news articles.

Lori? Steele. I just want to say, you know, thank you to the chairs for running a successful session. Thank you to all the working group participants who've engaged on the list and are a remote and we're here in room Remember to follow your charter as you work on your documents. The sooner the more precisely you follow your charter and you complete these documents without creating connections to other stuff that will help progress the document and that'll make the opportunity for considering a rechartering more likely in the future So staying within charter is the key to having a next charter and I look forward to helping you work on these documents. Thank you again to Wes and Claire and all the authors for your hard work. It's excellent to see the project if you made. Thank you Following on, this group is unique in that many other participants are not seasoned ATF experts and you've all figured out how to wade through this process, and I recognize that it's not trivial. So I you know, thank you for figuring out how this whole system works. It's a learning experience All right with that, I don't see anything else so thank you claire for hanging in and thank you everybody, remote. And thank you to all the participants in the room and we will see you in Dublin, hopefully for those that can make it there. And actually, one other thought we two typically hold interim meetings this group is very active in between My guest is claire baldi I will work through it but my guesses will probably do an interim in a month or so That's been our typical frequency. And we'll get back to you and post an announcement to that on the list after getting approval from Ori for doing that. Okay. Thank you"
