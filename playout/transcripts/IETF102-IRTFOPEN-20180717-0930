Lackey and Panos puppeteer Matos and I\u0027ll introduce them when we get there but I have a few comments about a few more things about IRT F so this is the list of all of our groups most of them are meeting and I\u0027m the ones in red I have a some comment about the you can see we have a wide range of topics they get chartered they update their charters they meet they they have interim meetings there\u0027s lots of interesting activity the quantum internet group is a proposed RG we have a an approach where once you have a new idea it\u0027s pretty easy to get a proposed Sergi you get three meetings and then after the three meetings we decide if you\u0027re going to be chartered as a full-fledged RG or not and quantum internet hasn\u0027t actually had a meeting yet we also have a research group that\u0027s in planning it\u0027s not yet having a real meeting it\u0027s having a side meeting so we have a lot of things I have a couple comments on news so this privacy enhancements and assessments research pair or pair G is having a planning meeting this evening there\u0027s a mailing list for it pair G at IRT org I\u0027d love for you to get involved in that I have another slide about it we\u0027ve been looking in open searches to replace some co-chairs who stepped down in HR PC the human rights group and protocol considerations and network management research group HR PC we will be appointing the second chair this week NMR G we\u0027re looking at a reach harder and so we\u0027re going to rethink a little bit and take a little bit longer to think about the people but we thank them before but will thank again people who\u0027ve been chairs there and we will be looking for a third co-chair for the crypto forum research group also known as cypher G so just there\u0027s some news on that this is a little bit about perigee I hope for it to work in a parallel fashion to cypher G there\u0027s many there\u0027s there\u0027s much much much great research on cryptographic privacy technology that is "
