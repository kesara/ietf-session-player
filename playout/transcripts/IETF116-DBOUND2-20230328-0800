Is that a better way to sort of make some headway? And starting with some of the sort of straightforward ones. State management cookies and the cert, especially the wild card cert, those seem be used cases that We understand really well, or at least we understand how we wanna get to some solution on those.

So my use case is actually Tim used the word supplement here, but he actually on a couple slides earlier I think a better word, which is complement the Ps. No replacement of the Ps that is anyone who wants to replace the Ps l can, but my use case is taking the current data of the Ps and allowing additional people who have control over the the the contents of their own zone to put in records, which will add to the Ps. So let it... And again, all know the problem of data of trying to merge two databases. You either say great. All the records in database b are not in a, so we can add them cleanly That never happens or it happens for five minutes until we let somebody else in. Or A bunch of records from database b new and therefore they can be added in. And then there are some problematic ones where a record in a and b both exist and they may be disagree on the metadata. That for me is out of scope because the person who's using this merged data can decide for themselves what, you know, how to deal with those problems. That's not a protocol issue. That's something that users can do. So the the the use case is simply to say the Ps l collects data in a certain way it has for a long time. It has certain users already.

Would allow somebody who says I want more than the Ps And I... The only people I want are people who control a zone to do that. And so it's quite easy. You set up something like a protocol like we have examples of and then somebody collects both of them. You know, you you grab the P cell, and you have a way of not automatically discovering, but being able to catch all the zones that have done it, and that's you know, that's not in scope for the use case.

And a smaller set of use cases might be expected as to we've mentioned, you know, I wanna beat the dead horse, but D mark took their, took their toys in went to a different sandbox. you know, Which is totally fine. Next slide please. So part of what I mentioned on the emailing was that we're looking for something more decentralized and distributed versus what is currently with the Ps l. So how do we admit something that is Ps l like, in details. But for the most part, something that is more decentralized. Next slide. So a little bit about kind of how services are at aws. We have a lot of different sort teams, many, many, many service teams. And they are the owners of all facets of their service that includes operational excellence. Security and all kinds of other things. Specialist teams advise them. Such as security teams like myself, and others but for the most part, we're, you know, we we wanna try and enable these service teams to be self sufficient. And be able to know operate by themselves. Something with, you know, kind of decent decentralized this that would include moving away from a centralized model where there's a single list or single registry and letting people maintain their own records for this type of technology. Looks like So there is some top discussion in the Zoo What's the terminology topic stream channel? I don't know. Some discussion ones we look about single points of failure being an issue here.

So talking about distribution, this is kind of the major issue that we have distributed nature. Excuse me. Next slide. In our case, and we feel that this is applicable of many other cloud providers, not just it best, but other providers as well. For the most part, our resources. all explained on the mailing list This is well if anyone wants to go and take a peek. We have Dns records per service per per region. So as we see more services launch into more regions, That's a significant number of Dns records and a significant number of things would have emitted to something similar to the P. Whether that's an internal team with the aws or an internal team or a team somewhere else that's a lot of impact to put on anyone or one team. With our case, you know, that's, you know, multiple times a year, we have multiple services in multiple regions. It's it's just a a significant amount of scale. You can think of as just a really large multi tenant environment with got go. And that's optional something that we wouldn't want to put on too. Any one piece of technology whether that's salad or something similar. Next slide. So it comes down to like, how do we wanna publish this? The current mechanism of the Ps l, requires some little aggregation. We've worked with Ps to kind of have a process that where that we're using right now. But with any single point of failure whether that's internal to a company or just relying on an external team. It's it's difficult to scale. If we move towards a more decentralized model, that lets, you know, service teams different company different cloud providers, etcetera, do this self service."

Next slide, please. Some other use cases that the Ps currently supports that we agree with. I mean, we're large dns writer, which I know if we're looking at going the Dns route for? That would be something to be interested in. We also currently use Ps kind of as a wide impact truck. I know that it's very... Well, I shouldn't say very easy, but it... There there's not a whole lot of like it you can get you can get onto the Ps psi as an individual or as a bad actor or something, but we do use it in a number of fashions for kind of like a, you know, are you sure type of check?

Like a lot more, like tourism ninety three more. So the the example that we had, I'm I'm trying very... Very hard to remember that the the stats I pulled before this meeting. There's something like, I think two hundred something services that we have just as an example right as a as a large cloud operator. Something like two hundred services, and I wanna say, like, three ish regions, and both of those numbers grow on a regular basis. Right? So if we presume that there is at least one entry per region per region per service. And that's going to grow significantly. With one cloud provider we would take up six six thousand? Six...

In the responsibility has been handed to some else. Now it is actually I'm unclear enough, if you say, you know, c o dot k, that is not know, it it is a public suffix. It is not somebody owing this. But then you have dot Ibm. No That is not know it's not the Tl sense that other people are gonna register inside. What is still in the public suffix list? So after we have a contradiction there. It is it was practical from the purpose in which you know, the public of created that brand hill would be just regard public suffix even though they're event evidently not public. They're supposed to be specific to the realm of of that of that organization. If you extend that, it is just that we have type of responsibility that are described and is not just one type response So seen the restriction. You just wanna talk talk about one thing pretty the wrong way about maybe the best way about it is to say, we want to describe give a language to describe where some responsibility starts with other responsibilities and it defined one hundred that is. So do you feel that's a clearly defined use case for a different solution or only defined problem. The drops. I I think it is a defined use case case. The dns industry owes it to the public to be clear about what things are. And right now, it is impossible. For somebody who doesn't happen to know."

Thank you. Anyone else? Often. If I can restate this more in engineering terms. I think what Ver is asking for is metadata beyond straight, you know, I'm above I'm below. And that would be a use case. I I assure you working at I can, we ain't doing that very well right now. I'm not sure that someone would do it better, but In my use case, I stayed away from what kind of metadata and I think what ver settings he has a use case for specific metadata. On abilities. To to be either registered or whatever. But still in the hierarchical sense, not in the not in the sibling sense. Okay. Thanks. This is Daniel. So I I just wanted to push back a little bit on the idea that the public suffix this is actually about public registrations. I don't know that it ever was. And this is maybe settlement nit point. Think the idea was that the public list was a list of domains where you could not guarantee the same administrative to control under that cut. Immediately at that card. So it doesn't mean that anybody in the whole world who is public could register there. It just means don't treat these as"

I think point, I think there's just simply a technical issue that when when the Ps was invented, it never occurred to any code to them, that there would be single user vanity Tl b's. So it simply has no way to represent them. But I'm hearing people talk past each other. I mean, I hear like, why people would like to publish lots of names at you know I understand why Aws wants to publish thousands of names. I also having talk to something like the growth, and I also understand why the people who maintain the Ps absolutely do not want it to be self service. They want to be able to be because they they believe they see malicious malicious submissions that they would not accept. Which, of course, you couldn't fix with with self service. And I mean, I also hear Andrew's point where the Ps currently currently verifies that entries are at least plausible by requiring you to put a tag record in your zone to show that you have some control over the name that you're asking asking they add to it. But And and and finally there's yeah. With respect... At ec point. It's like he's right. We had... If we had a, Mean, technically, you could, like, self publish it have something that collected all collected all the names every day and you'd have one megabyte file and people look good to could downloaded it they want.

Beyond that, it's all kinda of software that we can fix. Okay. I'm gonna close the queue behind to find because we do still need to get to the questions for Murray. Like go ahead. Yeah, Andrew sullivan again. And I I still work for somebody far as I know, but I still not speak for them. So I disagree pretty strongly with what John just said. And because... Well, sort of two things. First of all, the the Ps l doesn't have anything to do with own cuts because there's lots of stuff in there that, like, is in side the same zone and that that's been another problem that's that that's that's been part of the issue. But But more importantly, this isn't like just like a question of like, how do we distribute this in all the that it really boils down to a question of which problem are we trying to solve. And I think This is the place at which we founded the last time. And if there's any hope in this boss it's it's because we seem to have cut off one of the things. So last time, There were two kinds of questions. One about like, do I wanna be able to assert things about things that are below me or do I wanna be able to not assert things about things that are below me. That is I've got agreement across this across this boundary, whatever it is. Or one of these people can asserted about the other one. And a positive assertion about the other one. So that was the sort of d mark case. And it sounds like we've cut that one off. So another question is only you know, do I... Is this an inclusive model an exclusive model that is do I have to have agreement across these things? Or do I"

If it is, you have to have a agreement across the two across the two sides of whatever the boundary is supposed to be. That actually the question of whether it's across the tree or up and down the tree or any of those things all goes away because it's all the same problem. Which is you've got two sides of of a boundary of of some kind of a domain boundary And whether these are names that are strictly speaking related to one another in the tree or not is irrelevant because they both have to assert something. Is it only one side that needs to assert something? I think if you could get that question on the table and make a decision about which way you wanna go then that would tell you whether you've got a new problem here or the same problem that we just didn't solve the last time. Partly because we couldn't decide about whether we were assert downwards or not. So that maybe give you gives you, you know, a path through here. Yeah. Philip is next. Thank you. Yep. Oops sorry Not quite. Philip Sap, So I agree that the idea of this share amount of data in the P l. Could be published, but If I look at use cases in public cloud scenarios or extensions and errors and find customers going below a certain Tl. Or a certain special domain and then cutting the individual trust models across. These customers becomes very complicated. Doing statically bad in the slow process is very complicated. Doing this with Dns seems feasible. And so I see the use cases especially for"

Or be aware below this dns level, the domains can contain customer managed data or custom tension programs that aren't entrusted anymore. I think the search point is interesting, but it's too complicated. So I would also say the first to use cases apply for us. I think also being able to remove entries from list will be interesting on the long way because cloud workloads are much more volatile than this original idea of hosting in the Ps. Thank you. Stefan? Stephen Ba. Regarding the case of that Ibm which was mentioned by Werner. So problem is not that it is a publicly accessible by eighty anyone because we are for a long time Tl with registration we cannot not open to the public dot Gov is a typical example. It's not open to the public, but there is little depth at c dot gov on hours dot gov are two different domains and and two different administrations. So so we problem is not whether or not it's accessible to the public, but whether or not the supplements our in different organization or not. So in that case, yes, clearly, having think that Ibm in the Public list seems clearly a mystic mistake to me. But that is behind it, there is another mistake is that who should decide if Ibm is as to fix our registration suffix or not. Clearly, it could be the name older the Ibm company in that case and that's the biggest problem with"

But this is the right time to say yes, We're ready to charter. It seemed... First of all, we don't have a new charter to look at, which usually that's unnecessary piece of above but we're lying on the history that this was once a charter working group. So anybody wanna make an argument that this ready to charter, I don't think so. Right? So But it sounds like we have some problem a a problem statement than may be trying to gel. My my impression is that this should go back to the list. Develop this a little bit more and then we can try this again, or and in person or a virtual at some point, between now and the next meeting, does that... There's anybody think that's a bad idea. That that path is better than Is there another option paul? So Paul Hoffman. I'm not disagreeing you as A would you prefer instead of us starting over that we take a previous charter and hone it or would you prefer that we started from scratch? I don't think I have a strong preference I think raw materials are great to start with, but this... If we're based working on half of the original problem then I think probably starting from scratch with context better than trying to hack on the old charter. Anybody... Let me ask a couple of sort of simple questions. Though does anybody believe this should not be done here. Think that we're okay. We're generally okay thinking this is the right venue for the right venue for this work. Right? Okay. Sometimes the answer that no and, I thought I would ask the question anyway."

Would what I wonder, and I think where things went Arrived last time was is there going to be any agreement on a technical solution that, you know, could be an adopt draft. So a really successful buff, of which they're probably are none, you know, has a charter. It has, you know, a defined scope and problem statement. And ideally, you know, some draft that there's at least the beginning of risk consensus behind. And so everything that we talked about today is really problem space, which is great. But I I haven't heard off a whole lot of clarification in terms of Is there a success story after the problem space. Right. I agree. So some of those basic building blocks for a successful bot, maybe we should say Please go off and work on those, and let's try again in July. Send... Yeah. Send drafts, please who... Well, actually, there's there's a couple of questions we can ask here. Compared to the audience that we had the participants that we had last time, this room is pretty full. That was also true for the original Deepgram ba and by the by the time we actually finished that working group. It was to the two chairs and two people in a room trying to figure out if there's anything we can salvage. So let me ask this question is who would who you willing to work on documents or review documents? One, two, three, one five, six, Okay. So I've seeing, like eight or nine. And tim yeah.

One of the things we didn't do the pre last time was to mention the Ps. Mh. I heard a lot of stuff here about either like, my suggestion of of adding to or whatever. You okay with a charter that actually talks about the Ps as well? Like, explains why it's not adequate or whatever the use case is for. Yeah. So yeah. That actually yeah comes in and and names it. Sure. Okay. I don't don't. I I didn't wanna assume. No. No. I I I don't all that we explicitly left it out last time because we were afraid herding feelings or anything like that. I remember during the, the People came and talked to us about these are the decisions we've made. This is why it's managed this way and so forth. So No. I no.
