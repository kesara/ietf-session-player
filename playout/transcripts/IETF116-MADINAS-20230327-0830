Where we concluded that we should make a few changes which are further new fairly light. One of them about in the section six there was a list of requirements that we've been carrying for for little while. And you'll we we concluded that these requirements were for the group, not documents, so they were not be belonging to the documents. So there was a request remove the detection which we did. There were a few clarifications also that you need to be done. And I think you I topic that we'll probably want to discuss today. Is that there is a section seven which we say writing as series of possible solutions to the Rc. That section in fact we complete to right. Also not really belong to this document because the documents was a use case and framework doc not the Bc. So there was the request that we should probably remove these this section from the document. But once we have, of course, a Bc study, So with all the internal changes there be that you can documents and and the other editorial, but we kept the last section section seven which is no the series of recommendation.

So so you said the document is stable, but there's still the the the intention to take that section with the recommendations out of the document. Right? And then and produce a Bc? Absolutely. Yes. That's I think our are the next final with document I'll remove section seven entirely. And at that time, I think that reach stability is.

Is the state of a affairs regarding randomized and changing mac addresses. And what we've seen on the field about current implementations? The third one is a Bc assuming that there's some suggested ways on how to address the specific use cases and the requirements of each one of these use cases, we want to provide this current practice.

You know this is a call for more input. We have a lot of in scenarios where we have a lot of protocols at the that were defined. That may be affecting By rc.

Thank you very much, Jerome Michael. Hi. Thanks. Because I can turn on the video if you like. So I I put up to two use cases. I think there's probably that that we had can write a recommendation of what to do instead. And how to do things. I think that I've heard that there's some Wifi alliance proposal, I've heard some I stuff about putting identifier somewhere. I don't have details very concerned that they will be poor hacks to try to maintain a status quo of really poor encryption and really poor privacy.

And what I what I don't know and I, you know, we read in some of the the use case and other stuff is that you know, Mac addresses are used in other places. And I don't have a big enough and better enough understanding the details. My knowledge is essentially at Wifi home coffee shop scenario. So I think that there's gonna be some push back and getting some more details really clearly articulated to what's going on things. So I mean, talking to l two Vpn, systems, something else like that. There's there's there's gotta be a bunch of stuff like that that happens. I know I have some switch equipment that I mer just removed from production where It has unusually low number of Mac addresses in its tk cam. And It just falls over when we start doing a randomized addresses on Wi and you know, so there's there's stuff like that where there's something happening in a core network with Mac addresses and once you start multiplying them the network falls over. And the answer is, don't do whatever you're doing, but I don't know what they're doing and what a problem. So I think we have a lot of details that we need to get back out from some of those providers from those other protocol people. To figure out what to suggest. K. Thank you very much, Michael.

And so if the Mac address changes thirty times a a minute that's that's perfectly fine. And so the question is where does this document live? Who pushes it forward? It try.

Sand blah protected blood that use here dense terminology which is an identifier for that session. And then on the next association or upon to a next access point the station can, if he chooses us to do so, re express that blob that identity back to the access point. So as to maintain its identity as it moves or as a disconnects and connects back. So that scheme as a great advantage of being the control of the of the station, so it's very very efficient because you know, the station is in control privacy. It's nice because the do the blood itself is not something which is called constraint yet by e b h. Which means it can be very flexible. Now the group is looking at other scheme and in fact there's a lot of debate going on about pre association recognition. That's a theme that's been going only in B for for while now. Where some folks are saying there are some scenarios where you need to recognize the station before it associates to the network This is debated heavily because in to eleven there is no much of that notion that the station should be known somehow before it asks for service from the infrastructure.

What the the Ap gonna do is take my identity pat it and encrypted it with a symmetric key. And basically turn it into randomized garbage and give that back to me. And that's what I use the next time I try and associate to different access point in in the network. I'm gonna give this blob for lack a better word.

So as you can see that from all phones point, So yeah Seen a secure private roaming is. Basically in the concept of providing users with secure access to public Wi f network, without having to register or log in. So what does that mean? It pretty much means that the users can connect to a public Wifi network. And access internet we're not having to enter any personal information or passwords and go through that Tedious captive portal process that we all pretty much. Hate."

    "text": "See, the technology works by allowing users to connect to, like a a secure server that is managed by the sales provider. And then securely connected them a public Wifi network. So the secure connection allows you allows users to access the internet without any personal data being compromised, and then in addition to that users can also benefit from additional security features such as encryption identification, which, of course help to protect data from being access to stolen. So if we go to the next slide, Okay. Excellent. So as you can see here, pretty much put it in a once and four format. So in terms of open grooming. So the identity federation architecture, a legal framework that caters to these different business models. But it's all it all falls under the same umbrella. So if we now take a look at the diagram on the hand side, we can see it's a pretty basic architecture and then it's very simple and in some of how it works. So we have the running identity federation. And then to the right of that, we have the identity providers in the cloud. So the identity provider is the profile which goes onto the device. Is gonna allow you on to on the right hand side, the wifi network acts the Wifi access network any third party Id can be downloaded onto another onto the device as long as that profile that has being done onto devices broadcasting a set of Running consortium Codes. So the all goes onto the device and the also being broadcasted on the controller. And that is how you were gonna seamlessly connect to that network. As you can see there in the middle so the authentication and accounting. So the radius account radius. That is all done directly on the controller you can either proxy to... Let's say, cloud connect or you can do it through the Cisco... You can it through your Dna spaces to your Your Cisco dashboard, if you will. In terms of point three year something I policy at the edge enables real time and I all"

So, yeah, that's pretty much how it works. It is pretty straightforward in terms of how it works. Yeah, I know now Hong and and Who have done a demo hours a succession a hopefully few many people to sort of experience this first. Can we go to the next slide? Okay. So, yeah. In terms of mac randomization, so yeah, many wifi find networks. Have relied on the original sort of device mac addresses to facilitate access. To management of the network. So we're got a new way it's to pretty much identify devices or Wifi f network networks the networks will pretty much seize to be as manageable or as functional as they were. So this will basically have customer experience impacts as well as financial. So the introduction of per ssid daily and mat to Wifi networks. Is pretty much designed to improve the privacy of the user. But it can cause course problems for the provisioning of services that will need to unique identify the device is, all the users in in the case in those cases, which is then used for a proxy for the of the user. Yeah, we're going the w now. There there has been ways to identify randomized mac addresses is an impact on deployments for Wifi networks And has also been in contact with the standard organizations to address the issues surrounding my randomization. As you can see here, so, yeah, on the network for visibility on the visitor onboarding because it's identity entities and analytics, across application that rely on Mac addresses. And then on the right hand side, in terms of the users on Of course, it's used for privacy and having a persistent identify that allowance for tracking even if you have no indicators standard network. Yeah. That that's pretty straightforward. So if we go to the next slide,"

    "text": "Okay. So yeah. This this reverts back pretty much to the slides for I was just going over. So step one, with authentication is of course private. So Id goes onto device, and that is that. In terms of step two, user and devices are identified in contacts on on the right now, you can see the string of text followed my and at w d alliance dot com, all user Id would could be your name which is gonna be your name and then W dot com. So that could be anything so it could be joiner at cisco dot com or blah blah blah. So that's pretty pretty clear. In terms of step three, So identity providers shared agencies on behalf of the users. So As I mentioned, Id goes on to device that's gonna connect you seamlessly to the Wifi network. So yeah, the Id manager identity and the privacy of the user. And then in terms of step four, privacy you would user consent. So users know control privacy, identifies all persistence So, yeah, it can be random your text to sort of protect your user or you can have your email visible and out. So... Yeah. They're all different... Avenues to discuss and there's different situations to to to deploy. Yeah. If we go to the next slide, Okay. So this is now the slide on on the demo that was done on Sunday. Yeah, perhaps I can hand over to C, and I think he can go through this slide. Sweetie. Can do yep Maybe here. Yeah. You don't mind. Just Oh, maybe you could have to tune it on Yep. No. Yes. So I'm so I I I don't explain you yesterday what I get. Before that the how people show this panel yesterday?"

A bit too loud or Okay. Okay. Thanks. Please say select okay? Okay. So Yeah. what I did? Yes. So Yeah. So possible all, you need to install that credential in on your file or a Pc, So so if you if you have the if you bent under your car, so you have and under the Samsung or pixel of Google. You only need to you don't you don't do there any application. It because it's already natively support the running. But if you if you use the order for example iphone, you need some application So we prepare the application threes or the credential. So if you if you find if you start the of running in app store, you can see application. And then the after you installed your credential, your over your Id"

So you device automatically add another one Ssid it's seamlessly in the security. That is an open running the technology by hotspot mechanism. That is what I So yesterday. Thank you very much s. So Just so that people are aware. So we've been discussing with the Wpa about this technology and we want people to to understand and and and try it. So we had this the intention, we've been discussing for for a couple of meetings to to set it up as an experiment in the in the Of network. So right now, the plan would be to to enable it so that people can can see it and and play with it. The next meeting. There there's a process to get an experiment in the. So that's why it couldn't be done for this time. But but with the collaboration with Wpa, the plan is to set it up at the next meetings so that people can play with it."

We hear Hello? Yes. Jon, do you wanna take that? I guess he can't hear us. No. John? I think you've lost all. ...There's a button on the well, he can't here as tell us if there's a button to reconnect. Anyway. Okay. Okay. Well, maybe someone will be able to relay that to and he can post it on the list. Are these slides gonna get posted? These lights are posted. They're posted already. Okay? They were not earlier. Thanks. Look I'm excited to hear about this is more else what's going on? Thanks. So Jon, can you hear us now? Jon can you hear us? Okay. Okay. So we have an issue.

So as I said right now, Is proposing to coordinate it with this group to to run an experiment at the coming Meeting. And of course, we're planning to meet at one seventeen in some cisco. But besides that, I guess with discussions on the Bc, we would proposed having an interim meeting. It's been discussed before and and probably it's a good idea to have one in some three four week's time. If that's okay, maybe we will calling me with key stakeholders and participants and and and, of course, the the authors, I think that's that's to happen. But the idea would be to to host or request a an meeting in some four weeks time. If that's okay. And for the for in the meantime, Of course, if if anyone has questions, please send them to to the list, I think it be important to advance the discussion and the questions about the technology and and proposals about the next steps that we want to take. Okay. So he I see it Michael interested in having the the interim meeting and will look, Like guess for for the right time to do so. And for now, well if there are no any other points I think this would be the end of the meeting. Alright. Thanks everyone. And"
