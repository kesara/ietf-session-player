So Here are a set of use cases that I'd like to just go over very quickly. The first is privacy and customer data protection. And This is... These use cases here came out of work that I've been doing recently for my company, we are in a supply chain of customer contact, in the automotive market And I I see these use cases every day all the day. The time. The first is one company set my customer recording to another for analysis. This is something which happens in my company car guru ford Chrysler Da, all the time has leads that they generate from their corporate office either through customer conversations, email, whatever real time thing it was and they send it down to my company to make the first customer contact.

But someone at some point says, you know, do you collect personal data. And I'm know I know it's actually a very very fluffy term if they say that. But my first time always jumps to be, well, I'm not sure we can define it as the same thing at the same place for lack of a definition we Don't know what we're talking about If you gave me a conversation, And then I can make assertion about what's side of it and third party tools can make assertion this but what's inside of it. Next, what machine learning models is my data used for training or testing? So this is very timely. When we started this last year, we can take it be time quick, but I guess it is. Now pecans have the ability to inside them to capture and record interactions with analysis like artificial intelligence, sentiment analysis, transcriptions red, this this allows us to save with inside this this on the pieces of software that have touched this data, even as it crosses down through a a chain of custody. And then of finally, I wanna talk a bit about switching carriers and being able to take the data that you generated from on communication system as you turn to another and to export it, and then to it into your new new phone or your new platform.

The ability to to to take the conversations across a number of vendors then to consolidate it in the one place allows me to have a governance option. I couldn't get that otherwise. So any questions about this before I kick off to the next one, I have twenty minutes. I wanna make sure have enough time for both posts types of questions. Just keep going. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Next. I'll use case two. Integration of conversations and analysis services This is probably on on the other side. The first part was know what you got. Know what happened to it and has some authority around us integrity. And its contents. The second is this allows us to to integrate this into conversations analysis services. Again, Ai whatever, you know, whatever you want wanna call it. So... And this is getting more into the application side as we said before, the Standard is really intended to allow low level systems to feed other high level systems and they tend not to be together by the same companies, so they tend to cross networks they hit across across companies. So the ease of integration of these services is something the con enables. It's a it's an in format Json format which is native to the web needed to application developers. Easily secured it easily encrypted. It defines a a standard by which I can modify the conversation. And then provide the modified conversation with an audit trail back to where the original was.

They are full of information, which is yet to be glean So there's a lot more we can learn from these conversations even though we haven't really analyzed them yet. And the ability to express what we know of in conversation is is critical. To to be able to say, I know it's this conversation. I and then another thing which happens a lot is the the the number of different modes. We we tend to have a very siloed communications working ten the modes that we use.

And so the ability to to have a single interchange format at for the applications that covers all of the different sorts of communications modes is also very very valuable. One one one inch use case here which is related to this. When we did the white paper, we found out there's a lot of people in the in the market during transcription services. That are in countries that have very few speakers on like Spanish or English or Chinese. There's a very very small set of speakers. Pecans allow the ability to have training sets to be able to have organizations that put together you know, ways of testing, text speech algorithms that that joining exist today.

And to that, one of the things that we we also don't have is...

I think we're we're using existing It know, technology to to specify how to provide integrity how to provide encryption. The other thing that I think is should be in scope and that may be more controversial is identifying media types that may be missing. Not defining them, but to identify media types that are may be missing to enable us to to appropriately, you know, construct a a econ. Let me give you an example. So, you know, one one of the... I think your, things that we label or have been calling analysis is a transcript Right? So if we look at at, you know, here and you know, we're video conference now right through Mid echo, and it's being transcribed. Almost real time here. But you know, that in in some conversations, there may be a Pii person identifying both information in there. That I want to label and red because I can then take that a a form of it. To maybe give to a broader audience and and still, you know, have that be useful.

One is I were to build as a vendor, if I were to build my system inside my box, it be cool if I had like, all my recordings and stuff stored one place so that, like, I wanted to delete it because someone has been deleted, I just go to that one place and deleted it. That's great. But because it's inside the box of a single vendor, it it doesn't really need it dia sterilization. Right. I think we're here. To think about exchange of information between vendors. Correct. And so and the... I find the document mix some of that up. So for example, one of the things you talked about for For privacy is like, oh, I can keep track of or no, like, what models are you used to train my data? Okay?

On October twenty fifth, it was sent to Google on October twenty six, it was sent to open Ai in October twenty eighth. It was red by Bob, you know, in in the process of a customer support ticket. So that an auditing system third party vendor could use my Api and get out that information and export it from my system. That's one notion of privacy that's not protecting privacy. This is I think sort of management. It's just it's just logging what it is. Now there's a totally different thing, which is what I I don't think that's what your doc is doing, because it doesn't actually unless I missed have such audit log in, the alternative definition privacy is like, oh, well, yes, we're changing recordings and I wanna keep that confidential and thus encrypted it. And so I use privacy by encrypting the exchange of recordings between vendor systems by making the format itself encrypted. Those are totally different requirements and things you'd put in a spec. Which of these things are we doing? In this for one we talk about privacy. That was long. Yeah. Yeah. So I I I think the answer maybe we may be doing but well It means definitely the latter and... Yes. And and And possibly, the... Did I miss it it's not in the draft. Right? Yeah. Can I get to that one? So... So there is the section of the con called internet. Called an analysis, which is meant to capture the interactions that external systems have had with that piece of software, which can be used for auditing which can be used for the for for that work. But including like an audit log is not same is including, like the transcript of the summary gender by a third party system. Right? That's correct. And and the the analysis section of the icon is fairly opaque."

We don't work with any maybe others do, but let's say there was such a thing called an audit vendor. And it received audit logs. That's the problem which trying us solve.

One of them is quality management. So if you call the con center and you hear, Your call is being recorded for training purposes. Right? What that means is someone sends the three weeks and the recording to other vendor systems that, like, allow someone to listen to the recording and rate the call. And right now, there understanding for that under interchange. It is vendor. We exchange with multiple different vendors Is that a use case in scope absolutely? Okay. The current spec does not contain nearly enough information to facilitate that use case. I know what that is. Yeah. Okay. Great. Love that use case. Is that relevant whether this I'm trying to understand what's the scope of the work. Like, if I come up and I say, oh my gosh, you're missing field x because without that, I can't connect between my contact center on w o wanna to understand that the chair say it's out of scope or it's in scope because we're trying to solve that use case. With this format. That's why it's it's a charter question. That's in. Okay. Alright. It gets more complicated. I mean, you... That's what why I'm trying to ask how much these parameters you wanna swallow. These all add additional parameters. For example, quality management case, we need a lot more information about the agent. For it to facilitate this process like, there's agent groups like they award for the same supervisor. Yes. So that structure information is not currently present. We need to be added. Yes. That's right. Okay. So the next use case is is this in scope.

There like when I look at what is inside our call detail record that we put in our database our Apis currently export. There's, like, tenants more information in those than is currently in the draft. Call variables being one example. Every econ center has variables. That's information that's collected during the Iv r during the call. Their key value pairs, they're type, their strings or, whatever. Their name, they have Ids, there there can be hundreds or even thousands of them in call.

And I think that's the right sort of design and I think it's very important that we'd be able to encrypt some of them with different keys than others. So if we had a list that I search to have certain Pii, maybe they would be encrypted in a way that one vendor could read this, but another vendor couldn't... You. Different. I think see you guys not So my question is, We didn't really manage to get that over into the charter at all. So how do we get into the charter, some language that basically says, These icons are going to consist of a bunch of objects. Those objects are going to be encrypt with different keys. And that that is really the fundamental pulls of the the fundamental mechanism that we're going to use for dealing with the privacy on a lot of these and me... Maybe that's not even cracked. Like, correct me, if I got this wrong, but I mean, I think diving a little bit into the the designer implementation in say these objects are are encrypted. I... There's different ways.

It related to that, the insistence in the Internet draft that there's one human involved seems like, how could you accomplish that at the protocol level And to what extent are... Is that short sighted given how many chat bots etcetera are happening. The Sorry Got indeed. Yeah. Yeah. So Like, if you do have one human involved, you do definitely imp all the legal stuff around... Consider maybe data protection, as a broader, but in some ways more precise term than privacy. In that it... Mh. It seems like where the Eu laws already gone, the federal bill and congress down on the Adp has the data protection in the name, it might be spreading. In that case, questions about, like, consent of participants for purposes of the data use would be a really great thing to include. Mh. Like consider, like, a an online conversation with a chat representative where you've already signed off and your consent to the information before engaging in the conversation. Like that be a good thing to record and I think what you know, lower a lot of sort of anxieties. And then the last one, I'm thinking about just a use case. Say there's, like, this microphone in this room and the footage gets taken there's an extraction of the conversation from it. There's sort of a providence step terms, like, the the boundaries of the conversation, the same raw footage just gonna have multiple sort of conversational outputs, and I'm was gonna wondering how you're imagining that."

That that was I'm sure emotions and emotional opinions coming through the draft, which is identifying that the interchange is the problem and our data protection is is the goal. So that is that's that's basically why those words were used and I I The other thing about conversation versus that is I feel like the econ is a way of of defining the conversation It's kinda like a word document. It it's it's not something you can derive or something you have to define. This is what I mean by the conversation. This is what I mean mean by it. So that's that's why I was using the word conversation I could used the word it but that was the the intent of it. Secondly, very much so in terms of consent and being able to track the problem of who said What one of the ideas of of the Econ is there's attachments? Which are pieces of media, digital assets, which are in relation or context to the conversation. For instance, I think consent is a really good example. In my company, we we stick the lead. In the attachment so that when we look at the conversation, we know what they're talking about. Right? So and then I think data protection is a fantastic term. Love that. That that makes a junk kind of sense to me. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Sebastian, that was an excellent question for a first time atf attendee d? Keep keep up the good work. Hi. I'm Jo.

It's just every vendor has their own solution. Right? Mean that... And that's that's kinda where we came in. Right? That's that's the that was the initial stimulus is is to try to improve the ease of integration. So since Vendors seem to into operates and anyway, so I understand that.

So That one I'm calling thirty Yes Eight. No. If I'm if I'm reading that right. So Okay. This is getting easier now is I'm looking at it. It turns out that it's easier to start at the second. Hold and it is to to start the first. So I'm going to be asking does this problem"

I just find it odd that the this problem needs solving has more votes than the problem as well under to Just commenting. And so let me let me let me end this here.

I can just repeat what said before. It's about related work. Oh sorry? The couple I mentioned before, like, I failed to understand what's already saying how it relates to that. That's Well that makes me difficult to understand what's mixed makes it not well understood for me. Okay. Yeah. You're you're basically just saying you wanna look at charter text. Actual actual text rather than work in Right. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Okay... Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. It's yes. Perfect. Yes. So I and actually, let me say one other thing. Because because this was a above and I started helping fairly late The charter text has not changed since the buffer approved.

The F is the it didn't sound like there many of the people who are involved in transmitting this data present here. So my question would be how we're gonna create something that that's going to be used. If we don't have anyone involved in actually doing it here, and that that really wasn't addressed in the answers the questions when the where's the related work question came up. There was no we know the people who are involved in this. So there's no point Yes. This one. Yes. So so so so we should be recording this and the notes says hi, Fire from Jonathan to what Branch said. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. I I I I was not that off. The Cushion spencer along the lines of how many... I mean, we use this immensely. I mean we send all kinds of stuff to voice recognition systems m ml systems, otherwise. Right? So we we're a huge use of this type of technology. I maybe we just ask the boss questions of like, you know, how many people You know, other people who would be build it, use at those types of things seems to... I that's heart of what you're getting at there is there people who understand the requirements are needed. Yeah. And seeing that we are still adding you still adding significant use cases to what we're talking about then that's still going to have a impact it seems like to me, that's gonna have an impact on our ability to say, are the right people in the room I I have I have more questions.

So the question is, I understood there's certain domain specific part of it. Even though we have quite some people you around, which are that area the question is, is there probably people in in the industries that are not aware of the Or know, is there a a Liaison institution for particular domain, which probably needs to be involved at a certain stage. I think that could probably be a useful question to us. Okay. Marian At. And mine was as it patient around in the early part of the slides, there a statement made that this work was also being presented in other standards bodies. That was set a couple of times, but I didn't hear any further el on that. I tried to see if it was in any of the w three c lists that I'm on. I couldn't find it, or least it's not very visible. So I guess, It's more... Okay. The question is also what other parts of this work might be happening in the Elsewhere. What parts are going to be happening in other, What are those Seo And what is the mapping of issues in various places. So I don't even think we've had that conversation, but it was alluded that maybe should. That was the only reason I didn't raise my hand. We're having a quick shuffle to see who's actually gonna stand it up at a bite. Okay. Somebody cracked. Good. So We we have heard from representative from other organizations that"

I'm going to be asking is the proposed charter as amended headed in the right direction. I'm sorry? No. This they we were still talking about the problem space and things like that. So this is actually... Think... You know, looking at the charter that we looked at and thinking about the discussion we've had is this headed in the right direction. Pete is your question a question that would be good to ask now or... Yeah. I was just going to respond with regard to this part of the the reason I put my do not raise hand there, I think the reason you're getting somewhat weaker response is because it can't be known at this point.

Because it seems to have stabilized at sixteen and six, And So what Can jump across the the thing and and tell me that this is not what's happening. But what I think is happening is that the off proponents are taking the feedback that they've gotten. And proposed a new charter text on the Mailing list. For people to look at. So I don't think that they're asking for a blank check on that question But basically, just a when they look at the meeting minutes and the feedback that they've gotten, what should the charter text now say? Does that make sense? Great. Have you thoughts? Do they do the proponents feel like they have that feedback in hand or do they need to ask the list for more details? I mean, I think I feel like we've got some, you know, concrete actionable things to edits to to make to the to the charter at this point, I Might feel comfortable. You know, would I like more input from people, absolutely. Yeah. It it's not. Right? So, you know, anything more that you can contribute to the you know, you know,"

That's That could that could be coming out very soon. Okay. Like disturbing l soon. I want... I... But I have one more And I think it is really important to talk about this one as I mean, they got by being discussed in the in the room. Are the proposed deliverables as close enough to be useful. I think what I've heard is that we really need a Good use case document. At least at least for the working group to use, you know, rather than trying to continue to collect these use cases in the charter. So adding a deliverable for the for the use cases would be one of the amendments that I think I've heard. As far as deliverables go.

I'm involved in the drone remote identification protocol working group.

So I'm very supportive of you know, this for for that reason. And this is the common combination Mean way earlier in the conversation but I couldn't keep up. Also, if anybody said anything in the chat, eventually fell off the bus and didn't capture everything from the chat into the minutes. I know the chat is being separately recorded.
