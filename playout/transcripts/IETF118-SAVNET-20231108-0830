A second ago is inbound traffic validation It means border routers should block in legitimate package coming from other ESEs which forge internal source HSEs So in this figure, route to 1, route to 2, and route to 5, should perform afterbound staff and route to 3 and route 4 should perform inbound staff.

And in use cases section, the latest version uses the two use cases proposed in the draft intro dominant problem statement, to illustrate that infradome that can achieve more accurate staff and support automatically updates. Finally, it has a new section to describe how intradomentsfnet can meet the 5 requirements. The key idea of intradominant soundnetstructure is to exchange SAV specific information among intra domain routers automatically and then to generate several in routers based on both self specific information, the routers receive and their local routing information in their figs or ribs.

So to communicate sub specific information among adapters a new mechanism, namely theft, specific information, communication mechanism, is needed This communication mechanism is used for building the communication channel and propagating self specific information from source intake to validation It can be a new protocol or an extension to an existing call Although, the architecture draft doesn't talk about the design of solution.

Edgerofters generate several and perform after bonus app. So they should obtain the complete source prefixes of each connected 7 it.

Using RER data and, and, a lot of other things We do it automatically. We have automated this, and it's not the manual updates, that's the problem. The problem is that the rer data is invalidate not cryptographically signed. That's the only issue that we have it, the, the, the, the manual updates, I know that a lot of operators still update prefix list manually. But it's not necessary. You can automate this. The second thing, and I think it, I don't know if it was this slide or the previous slide, What I failed to see is how you can have trust. From your downstream a s. Authorized by that downstream AS. It's somebody else that needs to do that needs to give you to permission to route something. Now that is information you can store and and cash, a layer up in the topology. And once you have that cash, you know, everything downstream can change its routing or you know, do asymmetric routing. So not announcing anything but still send you packets.

That is our And for the second question, so we are talking about the intradermis Okay. So security, to say that intra domain routers can be trusted, but we also make some security considerations and ethr, ether, ether, Saverio. Introduce our security considerations Okay? So the 2 use cases show that introdominant 7et can achieve more equitable meditation and supports automatic updates. Compared with USPS based to staff, The introduction subnet can generate several of us based on both local routing information and self specific information. So it can generate more accurate stimulus in asymmetric route team scenarios. And compared with this air based graph, it can generate severance and exchange save specific information automatically.

So You know, even the sender, sending the loan information or invented the information we sort of find, identity that your information Yes. That's a good question. I think it's about a security. So, in there, I think in the architecture, we should do some requirements for the for, for, for guarantee the security of the self specific information. So, maybe give us some validation of their answer, AS, which will stay with us of specific information of build or build do some authentication for the self specific information channel. Yep. Okay.

This topic is about we want to introduce some kind of new capability from the data plan perspective So according to some feedback or suggestion we've got based on the previous revision that we need to carefully to, you know, choose our expression to void that, get detailed about the data plan solution design and then you put them later implementation. So this Here's here we go. This is the new rubation, also, we changed the type of title to general source address validation capability rather than the SAB table make make which one may be cause some anchorage. So here's the some background. As we all know that the current tours we have in the wild is bay basically, more based on u rpf. And ACR as, sub sub supplementary. Right? And the ERPF that in the close connect interface scenarios that we better use Stripe speak mode, but the ERPF can all do the asymmetric routing scenarios. This is one, significant scenarios limitation, of ERPF. And for ACO, actually, this is kind of basically, it's gonna react give way, tours.

The other thing is that We don't have many tours to do some more, you know, policy application based on the validation without. That a current common practice actually we we all know that the ERPF are just signed and dropped the smoothed back case, we don't know what happened. And who is the victims and who can be, benefit by this kind of validation. So take clear is that all this limitation, I think, is based on because country, we don't have the dedicated SAV tours for example, a fib is derived from your your API is the right firm fee. And the SEO is for, you know, more widely wider, you know, scenarios. It's not dedicated for SaaS featuring. So a more modes for, Saf, what it soft associate grants and validation.

So module 2 is kind of interface based based based based based based based based source perfect block list. So which means we, in some case, Yep. The best idea is that for open connected interface, we don't have capability to collect all you know, source prefix So what we should do so right now, we have One he chose is that We know what kind of a region sales reps by by our own.

So in this way, we can know that, the network where the DNS proxy is located allows to send the packets with 4th source IP address. This this, this, solution is proposed in using using security 14. And, actually, there are 2 cases, And as the first of all, he's is about DNS query and, assume there is, DNS proxy in the technical work. And, we send, the as proxy. And, when the data proxy receives a packet, it will forward forwards to carry, but, it will not change the source IP So if the if the, the s query can be for already this successfully, we can know that there is no advanced cell is deployed, in the tech network And, in the second case, is about, test response.

If if the DS requests are sealed, we can know that a tech network allows to receive packets with 4th, source IP address okay. This is a example, there is a DNS resolver in the tech net in the technical network. Who's a happy prefix is, triple 6 and, slash 24. We we have control the scanner whose IP is called 8 and we will send, a dense query to the, dense dense reservoir, by the way, we we support the source IP as, code 6 And, if the DNS resolver receives the, the spoof of the package, we know that, we know that, and it will for this, dense credit to to the assertive DNS server which we control. So if we receive the DNS query, we know that the DNS resolver or a the network where the answers are located, have no inbound style, this solution is, is a proposed in PAM 20 And the the this for the search solution, I is, SMP V Six base, measurement is to send the SMP V Six packets with 4 to source address to the tech network And, use a written mechanism of, SNPv6 as an observer to check whether the spoof of the packets are received. If for fewer SMP V Six response, is received. The tech network allows to, receive packets with the forged, source API price.

Several will respond to us with the 10, S and P equal replies but, if written anything is performed, we in the 100 of the SMP requested to the server, due to the return meeting. Server may respond to us, only with 23 SMP Echo replies So if the support of the package, reached the server, it will consume the talking bucket of the server. So we can use it, as an observer to check whether, whether the spoof package have been has been received by the as this work is proposed, in and the access is 23 there is also a baseline solution, it's client based environment. And, its carrier is deployed to client in the tech network and, the same package, we'll forward the source of dry between the client and the controller server. We have implemented the, several, software, which named the, an either cam it supports the Windows Linux and macOS. It can be accessed by scan you this QR code.

In summary, Saf op provides an open platform to implement and email the different sub mechanisms. And this is our hope. And, let's let's go into the current progress of some mechanisms. The act architecture of the software is is simple. We basically have a agent. We have an underlying routing instance, and we use IP tables to to implement the soft tables. And, to today, we have implemented a 9 sub mechanisms, including 5 you are PF based solutions, as well as, passport is a a dynamic solution, which, embeds a cryptographic signature in each of the packets, the headers, and, routers in the past will examine the header to perform stuff.

Basically, doing, neighborhood discovery as well as establishing the data transfer communication channels, between the south agents.

And, lastly is that we build a a neighborhood discovery mechanism in partial deployment scenarios so that, the, AS the the AS is, soft agents can discover discover each other and establish communication channels. So, let's go to the performances of different mechanisms.

We can see that, both, these are actually, decreases the control plane performance, BGP routing systems, performance. With the increase of, self messages.

And, here, and we vary the, deployment ratios of different sub mechanisms. We can see that the passport is, more than 500 times worse than ESAP or the, dsoft or edisoft. And this is because of this, per packet crypto operations that need to be done by, by passport. And we also find that, controlling forwarding performance of of the sound mechanism naturally, decreases with the increase of, a deployment ratio. And we believe that this because of the enlargement of the size of the, soft table. And we hope that the vendors can take this into account and a table management or memory management, mechanisms for the data plan of net finally, we look at the scalability of server here, we vary the number of, a assets and measure the, if sermon com completion time. The completion time is defined as the as all the AS having a blank soft table, to all to all the AS to the time that all the AS have their soft table field and those tables have been converged the key figures here is that, with our current implementation, a server with 256 gigabytes of memory can run about, 200 containers running south of and each container actually contains an AS.

The first one is a about what's the scope of the source prefix in the generated by your solution. And it's a focus on the So it's prefix of some device or the source prefix of the customer or the service. And the the second question is about if the routing of the service is distributed by the another process of the same IP type and or another type of ITP protocol or even the BGP. But it it works a lot. And how it works. And the third question is that about is this according for the of the SPT, works in a situation of PBR. That's all. Yeah. Regarding to your first question, about the range of our prefix we cover or to be validated and then we propose 3 options. So first of all, everything is that it will cover every prefix we can we can get in the in in the domain So the second option is that we'll only cover the prefix attach it to ASPR, an ABR the third option is that So we can cover whatever you want you've got customer configured on any note So is that answer your question?
