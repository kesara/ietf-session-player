    "text": "you can validate the sort of the server to know that that\u0027s not there so if someone comes in they\u0027ll be off paths in a separate TLS session and that\u0027s it questions Michael Richardson so the whole extra PSK smells like I could be one group PSK stuff with ex off and so I\u0027m kind of feel unhappy about that so I guess you\u0027re in a scenario where you are able to provision these PS KS easily to clients because you\u0027ve provision something else which makes me wonder why you wouldn\u0027t just provision for all public keys or something and I would be happier if the thing that you provisioned at both ends was a raw public key rather than a PSK maybe the quantum guys would disagree with me but for that the second thing I want to I want to ask is since in the cases that you\u0027re in a TLS connection that you\u0027ve actually validated the cert of the server okay it seems that you already have a public key that the server can sign with to prove that it\u0027s really who says it was and so or in fact that\u0027s not even issue because the the connection is already or you\u0027ve already done that right so it they want to do that yeah but the point is I\u0027m trying to say seems you\u0027ve already got something in some cases from the other side so anyway I just I\u0027m not I\u0027m not happy about more PS case anywhere in the protocol and I think that raw public keys are as good as PS Ches every time oh so one of the things I was considering for this is instead of having it like specified as an HVAC we should have we could have it as something more generic kind of like the way the off me load is defined today of you use any of these options and we open it up to anything that can be used for off that would be okay to me so given it I have someone go right back there\u0027s one problem here is that - that one the problem theory is that when the responder is verifying the first one let\u0027s say I have a million customers I have my learn by I indicator sector and only way to verify this is to go through all of them which allows very easy denial of service attacks this was the problem with the first quantum you know so that\u0027s one of these no yes that\u0027s actually the group P that that\u0027s that thought so actually this isn\u0027t that insane in this case because this is just for privacy remember yes but anyway so so if I am but anyway there there\u0027s two two problems here and I agree the first one the one that if the IRB tell the identity I think that\u0027s more important one and I think we should solve that in different ways because one of the leaders whether they actually discussed in in the quantum discussion we were having the OB two children rooms "
