    "text": "really minimalistic approach you because this trust does not have that much work to do so it makes sense to have a small relatively dedicated by the same token I\u0027m I\u0027m not as worried about as Bryan is about people being able to do this for five years because it\u0027s it\u0027s not that much important things that it\u0027s done so yeah I think the structured approach here is fine I think you probably go down to fewer trustees I would be comfortable going to queue if other people were inclined in that direction Thanks yeah I think I might look and respected that\u0027s not nice to do for boards you know dude stuff I think in this case minimal number seems to be three nice you have a container ship Royal Thai so I think it seems like a straightforward job thanks said it\u0027s already just just to go to the point that Brian Ren was making I\u0027m happy to look at any wedding suggestions you have but there is actually a mechanism here that allows us to maintain continuity and that\u0027s simply that should the stores don\u0027t line up to get this done at the same time as the IOC dissolution we simply ask the is genie to appoint the existing trustees for a period of time until this comes into effect and the advantage of that is simply that by not changing who the trustees are we avoid having to go through the USPTO filings that are required every time we change them so it\u0027s preferable just from a paperwork and simplicity perspective to avoid that but there are ways of avoiding and even if we can make that timing line up perfectly in publication that\u0027s it as far as the ex officio is concerned I think if you if you do want to consider including say one person from the ex officio on the trust because the IAB has more responsibility for the RFC series for which the trustee this is another sölden and I am also a trustee but I do not speak for them I the the danger in adding any ex officio thing here is the is that community consultation group because since we\u0027re changing the makeup of this by just saying we\u0027re just appointing people then there\u0027s an argument to be made that look we don\u0027t have representativity and so on "

    "text": "but one of the affected communities here is very big on representative appointments to things and so if we start doing ex officio things I think we will get pressure to have a lot of other ex officio appointments to it so I would I would I like that feature quite a lot that\u0027s a good point document author and also a trustee but in speaking primarily just as an individual at the moment and I think one of the things that we we have in mind here is that serving as a trustee should not disqualify you from service in other roles typically we say we don\u0027t want you to be on di ASG and there may be at the same time or the ice hat board and the IEP at the same time because you\u0027re in each other\u0027s Appeals chain this is truly a minimal amount of work and if it happened to be the case that an IAB chair or a former IV chair how doesn\u0027t I wanted to serve as a trustee I don\u0027t think it would cause them to be ineligible for any other role so I think that\u0027s another way around making sure we get that perspective without making it Exeter\u0027s here you could also twist the argument around but you know signing up for this keeps you an opportunity to claim but I can\u0027t deal with this other thing because for this for this document it doesn\u0027t have the pressure the same pressure which is a good thing but that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that we should you know not fake things forward this is I think a relatively simple thing and we didn\u0027t know how people in this discussion here seems the people are relatively well aligned so this could probably go forward well if you soon but obviously taking the RFC through approval will take some time and I don\u0027t think we can ask her this RFC until we actually accrued it so I think just to wrap up we have next week I think that couple of drafts that we mentioned we don\u0027t really need to discuss because they\u0027re gonna need to be updated but "
