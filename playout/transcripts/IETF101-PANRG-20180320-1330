    "text": "thanks Spencer Dawkins this week or today as a IR s G member so I you\u0027re kind of like what are the next steps and I\u0027m thinking next steps kinds of things might be to encourage people to especially people from the IETF to take a look at I guess it\u0027s RFC 74 74 18 which is basically you know the here\u0027s if you\u0027re an IETF person here\u0027s what here\u0027s what\u0027s different in the IRT F and here are the advantages of being in the IRT F here are the tools that you have in the IRT app that you don\u0027t have in the IETF because the is G is supposed to keep you from using them I can say that I wrote that document but the the so you know for example building community you know building you know increasing the connection with this community with people outside the current research is you know that\u0027s a thing you know so I don\u0027t know if there are is the a is a right place for this research group to meet that\u0027s not co-located with an IETF but but you can do that if there is so like I said I\u0027d like you to encourage people to kind of think think big about that if Allison if you and Alison and Jenna decided that this was to this point suggesting that the IAB sponsor a workshop to also bring in other people that might not be at at a research conference that\u0027s also a tool that you\u0027ve got so I would encourage people in here to think big and not think about how to do a tree Tran but this time we\u0027re gonna get it told us so yeah I mean from what really ER said I think it would be good to have you know for for all the drafts some kind of self classification where they think they fit into the spectrum right in terms of you know this is a cool idea which we haven\u0027t even figured out really kind of you know base research type of thing in one of the other aspects and maybe on the other side of the spectrum where you know a lot of us coming from development side and being frustrated with okay we think this is a cool technology they will work it should be in the IDF but yep business or politics don\u0027t work out yet so how far can we still drive it can we you know I have you know the research aspects of what\u0027s on the business side what\u0027s on the politics side in the research group help us to drive it over to the idea and that\u0027s just you know to our ends of the spectrum I can imagine but the clearer we you know try to self classify the work we\u0027re doing here I think the easier it is for people looking at all the work to figure out where they fit Matt Mathis there\u0027s a lot of really cool ideas in this space there are a lot of really simple straightforward valuable ideas that had never been deployed for a "
