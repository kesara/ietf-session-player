    "text": "it\u0027s not really sure how you gonna do that exactly but writing yank module is it takes two parts one is the syntax which is in the management theory and that is done the other is the subject area and that needs to be done clearly in those working groups which deal with the protocols that\u0027s how it worked with routing all all of the routing related modules are produced in the relevant routing working groups oh I see I don\u0027t get the impressions like a neat amount of enthusiasm for the security protocol designers to taeyang modules for the protocols ok alright so this this could probably discussed further but one thing that I would like to ask from the whole security community is that management people also need help and explain or at least guide how the security related aspects need to be addressed in in the modeling so Christmas you know sack I\u0027m sure there\u0027s people developing yang models as part Sakon for what it means to to be able to do monitoring insecurity on on network switches etc within the architecture okay what it matters and it\u0027s not a hundred percent clear that\u0027s the tightest fit for working group but we\u0027re allowing the work to progress at this point all right thank you all right thank you don\u0027t think really time for a mic so yeah yeah no one known as running oh yeah you open more minute and a half and I have exactly a 20 second question which is for Stuart\u0027s presentation in the discussion about TCPA oh and set that\u0027s error where is that discussion to happen da Deborah\u0027s come to save us I\u0027m writing area just talking in the hallway right now it\u0027s in the routing area right the impulse and Powell school but I think this the 80s among ops and security are going to discuss this and possibly we\u0027ll even have a design team to help to work on it that we get this document and in more documents jointly among all three or four areas there should be one more blue sheet pulling around in the back please bring that up if you have not signed the blue sheets come up to the front to sign them "
