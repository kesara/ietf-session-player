Good evening, everybody at San Francisco. So I have my quarter with me, Praveen. and he can go through a quick introduction to the problem, and then I can explain the rest. Okay. Thank Hi, folks. This is Praveen Ramadenu from AT And T. And this proposal is for BGP's secondary label and a couple of use cases that can benefit from better convergence with the use of this label. you blow please go to the next slide, please? So as we have various label modes, for BGP Labels it can be per prefix per VRf or per CE or in the case of in the case of the default work, we can have per next stop receive label. And the benefit of the per next top received label is it can help save the label scale. on a given PE device or ASPR. So in our topology, we prefer to use this third option, which is the per next top receive label. And when this mode is used, it does save the label space, but in conjunction with this, we would like to achieve better convergence. So we use BGP Peak. prefix independent convergence. in the combination of these 2 features, can result in some label churn issues, and that what we would like to explain in the subsequent slides."

So as you see on this slide, We have a group of 4 devices. and B1andb2 of the provider edge devices, and we have the route reflector devices in the middle, So these devices are acting as a route deflector. to receive the routes from PE 1 and advertise them to PE 2. And between RR 1 and 2, they advertise the routes to each other as well. And in this topology, the initial state VPN prefix from PE 1 is advertised. to both RR 1 and RR 2 with a label of 100 and RR1 assigns a local label of 200. and r r 2 assigns the local level 300 as you see here. And these routes are advertised to the p 2, as seen here. with labeled 203100. until here, there is no issue. but the issue surfaces when rr1 advertises, it routes to RR2. and vice versa. So once the study is done, the topple for this particular or the context for this particular label is next hop. and the received label. So in the case of RR 1, The next stop is going to be rr2 and the receivable of 300. So once this happens, subsequent label assignment occurs. for our on RR 1 and RR 2. which is shown in the next slide. Can you please go to the next slide? Yep. Thank you. So here, as you see, the local label changed from 200 to 201 onr1"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:18:01",
    "text": "And correspondingly, on RR 2, it changed from 300 to 301. And this change is because as we mentioned previously, the context is the next hop and receive label. So in this case, on RR 1, it will see p 1 with the label 100. and r r 2 with the label 300 And on RR 2, it will the p one as the primary part and other one as the secondary part. but then there will be continuous churn because rr1 will sign yet another local label So the 201 becomes 2 or 2, and so on. So it results in a continuous label churn. And this label churn can exhaust label scale on a given router. And the solution is to ruend this label churn, and at the same time, improve the convergence. So Satya will explain how this is how this can be resolved, with the secondary level concept. Thank you. Thanks, Praveen. Thank you. next slide please. Yeah. So if we condense what Praveen just describe, the local level allocation on a p or RR is dependent on the receivable that it received from the other and vice versa. is a mutual dependency. This is misleading to the level gen. Right? So to solve this, we tried videos approaches, like, trying to give a timer based approach in which will keep the labels invariant. and expect that all prefixes with the change in receipt labels within the arrive within the time but we quickly kind of found out that that's not the optimal thing. So it would go on multiple iterations before that would converge. So the idea here is what we are trying to do is we have a secondary label, which is based only on the primary path. In this case, the path from p 1. I will explain with reference to parts because it's easier for me to add that back to the net."

So since the so what will happen is since the label context or the context for local level allocation Now it depends on the 2nd renewal instead of the receipt label, if the second label exists in the update, Then you can see straight away that it really doesn't matter. what is the local local at the other lane? north, North, North, Right. Right. that's why this Lufil, sees to exist after 1 or 2 iterations. So here, I will not go through the solution walk through of 1 to 3 that is shown here that was shown in slide previously, but this is the initial state. Let me go to the next slide, please. So you can see that we started with So the label coming from p 1 is invariant. That is at 100. And the initial label local level in the previous slide was 200. Okay? on p 1. as rather on p0, And similarly on p 3, it was 300. Now because p0andp3received the update from each other. Now they are labeled context is based on the pupil, which is the primary path and the backup path. and the backup path for ARR 2 is the label 200. And Sorry. The it was initially 200. and then he sends the secondary label, right, which is the which is the same label what was before. because that depends only on the primary path. Right? So they will"

So this is another problem. Kind of not related, but concept. So here, We have shown a topology in which The same route is being injected from c 1andc2. And the idea is to always deferred the the c 1 as an exit point so long as it has connectivity to at least 1 of the p is p 1 and p 2. Right?

If that link is also broken from p to toc1, then only it was toc2. So Can we go to the next slide, please? So here, the so to accomplish this, we will allocate a primary label, which is our usual thing what we do in the BGP external Right? So we have So there is little bit typo here. I'll explain. I I wrote a mail to a jive, but I didn't want to pestering because I already wrote another mail before.

I'll take one minute. too. Thanks for that. So So if traffic comes with label 100 from the left side. it goes to c 1 so long as nothing breaks. If that link is break broken, then the traffic is diverted to p 2. And the label that is imposed on that traffic, traffic, going from p 1 is p 2 is actually the secondary label. and that 400 has primary path as c 1andbackupasc2. So traffic will come to p 2. And if there is no failure, it will go to c 1. Now if that fails, then p to static will be diverted to c 2, which is what we want. So next slide, please. So to do this, We conceptualized that we needed a new optional transitive activity. And the propagation of all that can be do like, done by notes that we have not shown here. And for this, we'll need an an assignment for the other code. And with useful to put the type field. It's saying because reliable thing can be used in many context. So just to know under which context it can be used. So we put a type 1 field and then the corresponding label. Right. concludes our talk.

And I can send some suggestions on IDR mailing list for that. But, ideally, if you can avoid the new optional at transitive attribute that you have defined is or trying to define would be great. The second thing is and it's a question for you is that this problem that you see particularly manifesting on RR is because you are trying to exist RR on a forwarding router with the next top self, and percresiliency label that you want to bind particularly. So my question is if you change the label allocation mode that's problems still happen or go away. So it's a good question. So this will happen with this particular level allocation mode.

The problem we have is that Sometimes these attributes get out into parts of the network that do not understand them and, you know, enforcement mechanism to filter them based on the feature. not able to be done because it touches routers that don't know what to do with them. calling this attribute escape, and this is not so much like a prison break know this is more along the lines of studies that their dog off their lead. and it's wandered away from you and, you know, it's doing something bad to the neighbor's flowers. So am I writing this document? Yeah. We have multiple audiences for this in the operational community. This is to bring attention to this as an operational problem and the things that it can do badly. here for IDR. This is a reminder that, you know, protocols very clear about how these features can actually work, but the consequence of the following the procedures is not always been clear, so we're trying to actually have at least a place to talk about the problem and then decide what to do about this in terms of solutions we want to apply in the protocol. we're very good about talking about individual path attributes and what they're expected to do. Generally, where they're expected to be done. We talk about filtering. have become much more restrictive over the last several years in both IVR and best about talking about does this attribute get away? And if so, what are the negative consequences? we're looking for a way to start having that conversation more rigorous fashion. atatat these things are all because, you know, BHP attributes are propagating according to actual transitive exactly as we'd like. So this is a happy thing and occasionally non transitive to to bugs. minimally, we wanna document what this condition is and then talk the mitigations and then decide what we want to change in terms of procedure."

You know, this gets out of the network, you know, eventually leaks into another network, gets associated with labeled data cast route, And now we're actually they're forwarding stuff based on prefix SIT procedures. not intended as the provider would like to have it done. Tunnel and caps is another example. Maybe a route squeaks out with tunnel and caps some point due to some SD WAN feature and get into somebody else's network that knows how to understand things, and then they try the Jira tunnel or traffic over to somebody, you know, 3 AS is over. This is probably not what they're intending. And some you know, signaling information like our extended communities, and this is especially a problem in best no, no some of these communities get out of control, pop into weird context, and know maybe at back into a VPN networking causes, you know, improper WERF imports or something like x, x, x, x, x, x, x, The place that's most scary for us in terms of IDR and, you know, hard to articulate to the general B2B consumers is when it impacts route selection you can end up with inconsistent route selection scenarios that cause black holes as the routes point to each other in unexpected ways. We also have the general problem of actual transitive nonsense. when we had the motivation to write the update to the HP Air handling procedures at RFC 7606. This was because of the address set, you know, attribute 128 that got out. we had 2 different flavors of the no protocol field. No. It was literally a 2 byteas versus 4 byteas as that transitional period. and they would treat each other as bad updates. and knock over the adjacency sessions rather than know, this you know, obviously, it's not attached to furway.

And Why didn't we know that? know, recent examples that we have in the operational community, the entry level stuff is we've been going through IDR has been interesting problematic. We specified that in 60 790, and that feature had no tagging it at the prevent, no escape or to detect that it happened. The authors, you know, Creedy and John very quickly realized this was a problem and very quickly put out 7440 77447 said, do not do that. And Well, they didn't stop our own company from screwing up and having an implementation that was in flight. No sticking version 2 of the feature on the same code point. Yeah. We screwed up. shouldn't do that. John has put out basically an apology Internet draft that explains the scenario. but that didn't stop somebody.

Number 1, this impacts route selection. You can end up with some routers in your IVGP domain, selecting the path one way. Some of them a different way. You have route loops. And even if you don't have route loops, this feature is intended to deep preference routes that are actually being passed around means that if you are the owner of a very large network that has interconnect that's using this feature. escapes into the Internet. and you have a comparable route from somebody else that doesn't touch the DCI, Your route is the worst possible route ever you have intentionally lost money because you're not attracting traffic anymore. And, clearly, people think that's a business problem. what this really is about, and we've had multiple conversations over the years about this classic problems. This is about scoping. tried to do, you know, this in different situations. Minally, what we wanna discuss is those common scoping criteria. build up a taxonomy, what we're looking to do, and then talk about the mitigations for them in the protocol. what we should recommend in our documents AS scoping is the number one scoping that we use across most of the BGP. intraas as a scope is a thing. important thing for this group to be mindful of is we just had a presentation about this one administrative domain feature, know, session yesterday, which is intended to break the rules, but what is an AS. We're gonna have to think about these things in a more broad context. Some of the things are really scoped on next top. you know, for next top change, you expect things to go away. know, the next top capability has this is part of our procedures. We've talked about this for other features as well. The situation dealing with consistent route selection is a really hard one."

    "text": "know, it really implies in most cases A flag day in some portion of your IVGP domain so that all the routers that are passing around this set of information, can consistently converge. This is a tricky thing. we don't have clean mitigations for this. we don't have a good problem description of it, And this is really critical because especially for a lot of these best related features their operational assumptions are usually for a flatter network or less hierarchy and the rep reflectors, They're impacted by this and they don't seem to be aware of it. And the the stuff is settled. Part of the reason is we want to write this down so people know to watch for these problems. Even for boring things like communities, Now we have the old school in 1997 communities. We've added large communities. cleanup of these things as a problem. Randy Bush's head excellent note papers on this over the years. You know, thank you, Randy. We have RFC 7454 that discusses how to go about doing this stuff clean up at the operation level, terms of protocol implementers, technically, the protocol has said all it needs to. This is more about vendors putting in, you know, good models to allow for better cleanup And this is where as protocol designers, we should be listening to people about doing these things. When we start interacting with the e v extended community features, our use for VPNs, We care about this one step more because cleanup is very tricky. So building profiles where features actually are scoped to in terms of the families, providing easy modes for cleanup. are all things we can do as implementors, but we all set to discuss the operational considerations of these things getting out Other reason they had this conversation is sometimes it's not oops. Anything here that can cause a session to fall over due crashes, inappropriate scoping, session resets if you're not falling full so many So 6 procedures for whatever reason."

So so this is a very important conversation from a security perspective. This will be part of the conversation we to the nogs is expanding this work, hopefully. Terms of mitigations of things we can do in the protocol, have an interesting conundrum here. explicit filtering of path attributes is one way to proceed with this stuff. trouble is we know that BGP is successful because you can incrementally deploy new features without necessarily having flag dates across the various providers. If we have people start taking security postures, filter everything except for that, which is permitted, we have cut off new features. An example I gave Rudiger between sessions was we're to do the large BGP feature using an aggressive security stance, that feature would not have actually gotten deployed. that's a very boring feature of the grand scheme of things, much less any of these more subtle things. so so this is a conversation. Sometimes attribute filtering is safe for certain provider classes. If you're a stub AS, You know exactly what you're allowed to have. If you're some form of no transit provider, You may want to filter, you know, for protective measures but You're also potentially losing yourself, Muddy, or customers because your routes being filtering something important, may break a feature of customers depending on in a transit fashion. is gonna be a long conversation in terms of what we wanted to do in the protocol. this Ben Addison offered a excellent suggestion in terms of, you know, thinking about things of maybe an example. We take our path attribute space, split it somewhere internally and say, Some of these features have implicit scoping, older implementations may not understand that. that's fine. eventually, it'll get to a range of places where this might actually be enforceable. Maybe it's a generic of mitigation. This is part of the conversation we're looking to have. In particular, we're looking for smarter filtering technologies to be built"

    "text": "to implementations, especially as part of profiles of features. know, we want easy modes to scrub things and make it safe on devices that are participating in the protocol mechanism, or devices that understand the protocol mechanism, but are non participants, as an example, ASPR that understands the VPN knows how to scrub it even if it's not gonna participate in the VPN itself. So part of the discussion about what these profiles may look like from operational standpoint and also what we put in our documents. of course, if we get around to doing PHP 5 or something like that, you know, this is a chance reexamine the conversation. Sounds a little bit silly, but we've talked about, you know, a attribute enhancement that put scoping in there. It's an adopted work item. not a single person has done it. So in terms of next steps, This is about socializing the ideas and making sure we actually can talk about things. at desk needs to get a flavor of this presentation. We will talk to them the next ATF. I'll probably go on roadshow at some point to discuss this in the operational community. What we're looking at is how to take this work forward even if it's not necessarily my document. let's talk about what the problem is, build a good problem statement, and let's actually start building mitigations, operational procedures, and potentially Is there something of the documents we should be doing normally We have security considerations. We have operational considerations. For BGP, maybe we need the considerations about attribute scoping. And once we actually figure out that that that's probably, you know, work that IDRO to decide the take up. We're we're about out of time. So I think I'll happily discuss and take questions on this after the session. Thank you. Then are you going to go ahead and present? If so, please go ahead. Okay. Thanks, Sue. Hello?
