Which is also a joint session with the chic working group. Please make sure that you are in the right room My name is Carlos Gomez. I'm acting as delegate today. The chairs and the usual delegate attending remotely? And they will continue. The shares will continue presenting the introduction in a few slides. So before that, this is the note well. This is a reminder of Policies which are in effect on several important topics, such as patents or code of conduct. So please make sure that you have read also, like, in the last few It meetings, there are also some meeting tips for this one. So for in person participants, please make sure that you sign into the session by using the by using My, usually, it should be the client. Which you can find from the data tracker agenda? And recall that you need to use My to join the queue. This is single unified q, which is managed your. And if you're not using the on outside version of My, please keep the audio video off and recall that we need to wear a masks unless we actively speaking the microphone. For remote participants"

To Is interesting also the community folk Maybe we go to slide and shell them again. Don't know it. Okay. Okay. So there we go. So we we have the package and therefore today, but I guess we we can make it. So we'll start with the usual agenda matching and it go through the process that has happened and introduced the new working rook. Will be discussing the practice of the transition between One and ship. Then we'll have sergio you for two presentations told twenty five minutes. So Sergio will talk us about the new work is try"

And we'll talk about with that now, about the discussions that around this is. And then we'll have Le laurent on the seat location new work to to allocate locate said on the chic access control. And with this that's that should basically cover the whatever the hats that we have but code. So status cellular documents, you can see the... Notes it's small because we have a lot of documents now. But we have three three important things basically that that we want to discuss today. Three documents where the Is there was a lot of work lot of changes. On the mailing list, the bottom of nine years One of the document which is an Iot is on the see Hands. So this is the the fundamental between the to complete this document. So we're very, very close to us forty eight. Then the two sig five documents, the basic folks in the cup, they're already in the queue as well.

Well one of them is the chic architecture, which used to be the One architecture does now be renamed as chic picture.

The goal is to take all the personal submissions that you want to continue. So there are seven of them. And move them to shit. And the way it would happen then that's the discussion for today, is pretty much the proposal on the table is this. So documents that received complete will ship as.

And now since we are moving to chic, do we consider this or do we rephrase things and if you have a constraint device you are this this, or we keep it in lp one. I'd like to take actually have. Do we work to maintain a one active and make it the chicken one meeting till, That document is complete, how do we move it. So the responsibility for Lp one, As far as I know, the Oem part is already part of the chic charter. So you could move it there. It it was the point. And to reply to the last bullet there, even if it's not get, mentioned by Pascal. Chic charter includes maintaining all lp one documents, So I don't think an adoption code for shi for the architecture. Easily really required. So jumped directly it if somebody complains I will address it. Would be easier. So consider do I update and submitted like this. Now when we write a document, we don't consider that the device is constrained. Oh the network is. Sorry. No. Going. I was missing that point law. Indeed somehow, Right? So you're right.

And that that's what I in mind as well. That's what They would have so so if you have a a use case for Lp one networks. Just writing your document and this is a use case doing network. And that's it. We cover one's a part of. Yes that's kind of the wait the charter is written. So that's why I I was thinking that all documents could move to to shake and then we would basically smoothly shut down. And then Same goes for the architecture because that's and on that. So I we we won't make another adoption I mean, the group has been following and adopting the document drivers. I agree with a rake. We don't need an another introduction call. Was just mentioning it because wanted to make sure that we have an agreement. Charter So please read the charter. We don't have much much time, so I won't spend too much time on the first page. This is basically introduction that's saying that check is taking of a one all the subjects.

There are specifications that that's are written. Certification tools, we have the test vectors So you can actually submit a device that is running shape.

Some examples, of these applications or use cases are you sending sensor measurements, for example, from weather station or you are doing location coordinates are sending location coordinates from analysis tracker. Also, you can have our continuous stream of of compressed and un fragmented check packets in this case. The motivation that we found is that Current chick fermentation modes, are not optimized for streams of data the acts are required on a per bucket basis so if you are sending a continuous stream of cheap packets, you will be having an bread packet. If you are doing on transmission, you will be having exactly when I very fragment. Actually, other methods are been used to to do some kind of a streaming mode over cheek. In this case, using rule like ids, And we see that the new technologies using have large empty sizes and requires reliability but not necessarily fragmentation. The streaming mode is based on. And it supports will variable empty size. And to some extent the out of order delivered And to do this, we use we define to transfer cycles the window cycle and the doc cycle I will explain them now.

And below we have how the cycles are managed. In this case, a window cycle is when you send fragments from all windows, and you continue changing the number rising the number. Until you get to the last number that you can use In this case, we have a window number of one bit, for example, So we have available values of zero and one. So once we use zero and one value, we will be modifying the detect number the value adding one so that we can move for example to the next window cycle until we get to the to that the tax cycle that is when the tag number will changed back to its original values playing a bit better now. So a window cycle will lend once Fragment, the last fragment from the last window, this case with the highest possible value is sent and the... And at the end of the cycle, the window number reset and it increases that value. In this case, the cycle finish once the type value reaches its maximum possible value. And we we propose a successful chic act to close the current detect cycles and the cycle and open a new one. I will explain why A been later. Here is well, the ag behavior that we we found is the Yes pascal?

The idea of having this Opposed to having two different information. window and the detect is so that you can send ax regarding the windows and you have the detect that is a larger value that will be cycling around these windows and you can send expert tax cycles. So since the compound you well you can send mac that is with the value, the window. And all the windows that are notified. So at the end with the detect value, are able to to to cycle the windows and you're are able to to to stars like that the... Like, the new cycle. And count cycle you're in. And actually if you're sending Well actually, yes if you don't have the value, you probably will have less possibilities of of out of order delivery because you will be repeating the numbers sooner. Oh, but if if the windows your example heels the window was two bits. Right? You you would When the signal would be mostly just same Anything thing that that looks different is on the bottom right you can see the d type cycle as a single window.

I wanted you to actually talk about that that the thing because that's a thing that left between, but Oh, if you if you always do deduct zero windows zero one, zero windows zero one And and you do it like at the end of the t tag My question was, how is that different from having on the windows, of two bits and arc at the end of the window. Yeah. Actually it can be a similar a similar case. Yes. You're right. We can have larger windows, and we will be having a similar behavior if we want. Without the defect cycle. In use case this more I larger larger like a stream option what's the idea? Just one question actually, which is actually... I mean it's it's a follow of to pascal silly question. The way I understand is you're using the to limit I mean, at least I was thinking that you use the detector to limit the different packets. So one moment tank. Yeah. We will have to define that I really because in this example that we're talking about where talking about no fragmentation. So we would be having a packet better.

If we don't use the sheet compound tag, then you don't need this. If you don't use the trick compound, you will be needing one hyper window. It doesn't matter if we are using the d detect or not because the to identify the window cycle, let's say, from which the Windows tanks. Okay. Okay. So I mean, so then the the reason you're using the tech is because the compound that as a optimization. Yes. I would I would show here. Here... Yeah. We have the the component with the value that will reference a specific window cycle. Yeah. We we can we can see if the cycles are really that necessary or if we can do it with just the the window cycles. I will I have here an an example.

Well, you wanna finish your phrase and then maybe I can I can jump in search Yeah? Well, I was saying that the compound at the end of this window cycle is optional.

Right, which is something that is right now in the specification. The the moment we have this extra bit we are decoupling that the the sending of that very last back. And that can be a synchronous. Yeah. So that's that would let... That would let you keep going with the streaming Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Exactly. Depending on the size is the the amount of time that you can actually continue sending before going back and recover old fragments. Or even repeat all numbers. So let's say that the time the lifetime of the tags it's the determined by the tax cycle. For example here, in this case, we have the first window cycle here that is acknowledged with an act. In the next slide, I have the following transmission to with the the cycle And in this case, the window cycle is with the third one. And at the end of this cycle, we can actually send both that that Doctor was sent before for the previous window cycle and the act for this window cycle. And it's cycle is identified by the detect. Right, Which you couldn't do if you didn't have that. Exactly. We will be needing to actually move really straight of in sets of of cycles or from the windows. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks."

In this case, we can have other windows if we want to recover faster but still we are able to cycle. Around the the different window cycles with the detector. Oh, that's so so you're saying that's the capability to have intermediate acts at the end of each window within the detect. That's that's the difference. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That... That's what I meant by asynchronous. Like, you you know, have to wait until the the specific moment to do the act, you can a previous mean, a previous tag. Let's say, interesting to say you can guess asynchronously if I you like, you can add what you got. stuff detect because the deduct seems to be... Well, Here now the the detection seems to be an artificial way to say the at the end of each windows If you said yuck, if you... With to want is nursing zach, Then just to know with that's stack. But don't have those to two things Why would that be at the border of each window? Why couldn't that be anywhere inside this speak. List. The the thing is that the numbers will repeat itself to... Depending on the window size. So we will be having the same windows that we lose utilization and travel number, So we will not be able to recover.

Because I agree with with with what you're saying, Like, how do... What is what is the fundamental difference between having a bigger window or having the detect. You know, and and there is some... Like but with... Maybe we need to write this down. Anything that And and and I just like to add that to the comparison, we also need to check the bit map.

So so thank you. Thank you very much carlos and sergio. So okay. Lori, you had the a point to twelfth briefly for implementation point of view the the tag is a way to not reproduce the rule several time in the set of rules. And so you can view the the tag like, an extension of the room road Id. And here we put it in the same probes and so I think it's a very big change in the way we have to implement check. Okay. Yeah. Actually the amount is not augmentation mode and it's not compression mode. So it's like a different thing also. I will continue a bit fast to to. And and and just want one point maybe to consider what happens if you lose? So that's person... So I mean. What's the what happens if you move the entire our window? You can know because the detailed value of the next window cycle will be different So you lose me see that I if if she was two windows."

Because the the thing is that I would go to next slide. The you cannot recover fragments after you change the cycle because all the numbers will repeat, all the number combinations will repeat. So the idea having this detector is to actually have this this larger that the numbers will repeat they you will have more numbers available before they repeat themselves. So the out of order delivery is actually supported in the detox cycle basis because after that, we not able to to actually recover fragments. From previous tax cycles. That proposal here is to close communication in the all one message. That will be the one that you can send in any moment and you will be closing communication from the sender. And you can send our receiver aboard, for example from the see to to avoid communication. And well in this proposal, we I it was more focused on on fragmented cheek packets. Our future proposals can also handle fragmented fermented packets, for example, that are it's two or n fragments, so which and fragments, you know you have a a bucket that you need to to res Yes.

We also identify another option in this case, we found that in aqua, the first fragment has always the same number In this case, we can use this fragment. We can modify, let's say that this fragment for for to contain the rule.

And when we can also have our messages like rule of the message that's I will go really quick to that. In this case, we can have a simple message. That is just two exchange rules between devices. So the idea is that we can use the c encode rules to to scenes rules for for instances that have been done or to update rules or exchange rules. So Thank you very much any comment question. Yes. That's an interesting idea. But it means that you send the rule each time you initiate the session or Yep. That's an idea that can be or you can make change rule when in a session where when you need to to have a new rule. Would the It's an idea. You can exchange actually rules for session. Yeah.

As I do in the Ppp draft. I mean, basically, it both like cells, So like to see that what we do in Q p compressed way or a shortcut way of generic thing that you're proposing. Okay. Just like with run on for instance is even more compressed because less and the rest is implicit. Right?

And of course, things happens is then, and I had idea about starting from at twenty four as a building block for some potential working course, I had a new reading to the other with fresh.

Again, I hope is the outer compression. Even any, of course, as pascal pointed out. So if you really want to take that step by step, the client will start with an and in compression with rules shared and twenty with the original server, that produces a a compressed oscar plane text basically. You have the encryption And what follows is the outer compression using the rules shared between the client and the proxy.

You can just treat all of the c op option fields. As just fields and you compression on them in this way, you don't get the issue of rewriting the the Rf every time that there is a new option. So for example, you can just say, okay. There's a club header. I in the pe, you have a delta. Feel you have an option mansfield.

But it takes more you send more information because you have to res resent the the rule instead of modifying it. But regarding the excess control is the same. Anyway, just detail. And so the Very is also for fragmentation. So for moment, I don't make something feel very sophisticated. In fact, here is just a possibility to change the timer and not everything else.

So we have to ask is described in the architecture. We have to identify the session. So be the over end. And so when once it is notify, we can get to the set of rules. From the set of rule, we get the permissions And so we allow our not the the command, and then we apply it to the set of route if it is accepted. Eric you wanted to talk or it's Oh, okay. Okay. Go? I jens and then the with the end. Just to say that modifying the time is and stuff like that. This is like a very large door for attacks. Right? You change your timer now? Get into some kind of interaction between the layer two and and what what goes on top of it. And you create crazy crazy stuff.

It's just we need to careful So that's the proposal we made with and then uneven. So the question was is it enough to to be two for working adoption? Luis just me, we need to talk more about all the security implications of modifying stuff. Because we we ended up with points like, it's just for, she can get some better compression by being more speak and and if you do that, then it's also, we need to resolve and same for the timer and for the empty documents. So do we want to modify to rules. And in which circumstances, etcetera mh. And once we agree on that than Yes. We can we can go into details. To different I adopt, but So once scenario, I see it's not the generic generic one where you you change everything. So in my view, the most reasonable one is just to change target value in in a rural.
