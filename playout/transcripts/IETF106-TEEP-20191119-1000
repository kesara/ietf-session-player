    "text": "number four and making me the problem the other doc okay we may need to okay do your other issues tomorrow okay but I can finish the right section yeah all right this is the rats profile point that Lauren brought up there is no issue in github yeah this is the only slide that I have that no github issue was filed yet and there\u0027s none that\u0027s filed yet because it wasn\u0027t obvious before and that\u0027s part of the question here is is there any change as what document would you file it against or is it just in an in a new document so here the question is whether and to what extent the architecture document should talk about this concept okay so to you that if you are new to the rat\u0027s discussion here in order to use rats work you need a list of what claims that a tam is expecting to come in now if you look in the OT R P protocol spec where it does add that station itself you\u0027ll find a bunch of specific elements that\u0027s in there that could be used to help generate that list that\u0027s in a protocol spec not an architecture document right so currently no official list exists but you could derive one from that and so the question is should the architecture doc have anything is it just in the tea protocol spec or is it in some new teep document that\u0027s the rats pro the claims profile okay because there\u0027s no issue the presumed answer is anything other than number one but if you think it needs to be number one or that or that the architecture document should at least mention the existence of this then there would be something to say even if it\u0027s by reference to other doc okay thank you this feels like something that would pretty naturally fit into the T profile of the rats work correct is set a new doc or is it in the protocol spec there\u0027s only difference between two and three my preference would be three okay so unless do you want to get an object number three then the list goes in here and then the bullet underneath three that\u0027s implied is should the architecture document then mention its existence or should the architecture document continue to remain silent on this topic the latter is less work for us but the other thing main is on your on me yeah yeah yeah well actually my points are shit omission it even separate document we need to make it right understand that then options three you put releasing a new tip document that are specifies us profiles but I click told me she\u0027d point it because agitation is a part of it and she\u0027d point to that so we have a teep milestone which we may not need but the the tip milestone says we wanted this one of the architecture document to go to last call in in December and there\u0027s not a document to reference yet is the only problem number three if we wanted a reference it okay you could say left for future work and "
