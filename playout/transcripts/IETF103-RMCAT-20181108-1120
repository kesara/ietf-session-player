    "text": "working group John yeah I think the one thing we that came up at ABT core where we felt like we needed more feedback from people actually employing congestion control algorithms is how should the feedback mechanism handle duplicated packets because the feedback is indexed by sequence number so obviously if it packet is duplicated you can only report on that once and the question is what would be the most useful report in that case it\u0027s report on the first arrival time the most recent arrival time should we I don\u0027t know maybe add some additional flag which would be a format change saying this you know packet got duplicated something strange happened or what I mean so I feel like we need you know what is going to call you know be the most useful for the congestion algorithms to get the information so if people who\u0027ve done suppression algorithms could get feedback and I would be helpful do I kneel you can kneel if you\u0027d prefer that looks better Glennis and I don\u0027t know if another congestion control feedback mechanism that reports duplicates at all okay I mean so so maybe we don\u0027t have to go to that complication of actually bothering with we need to specify something yeah we report on exactly like it\u0027s maybe maybe duplicated yeah you should choose one is what I\u0027m saying yeah Kulemin so arrival time I think you should choose the first one because that\u0027s when you actually process a packet and then you just throw away the duplicate right so that doesn\u0027t matter for you also have easy and feedback in there right you might want to like I mean it can also happen that you get the packet you send a report back and then you get the duplicate right then it\u0027s already too late but if you actually happen to receive the duplicates before you send out the report and one of them had a congestion marking I should think you should report on it because it\u0027s still a signal from the network okay so the suggestion world was reports the time of the first one and if you get multiple ones and one is ecn marks then report them up here okay we\u0027ll bring that abt core but I have no objection to that in principle and unless anybody else has any comments the other reason why this is an issue is not just the network duplicating packets but because certain implementations hem Firefox don\u0027t support the RT X payload format so use packet duplication for handling package you know retransmissions sure yeah okay "

    "text": "it for the update for this draft okay thank you touching it to see some implementation experience I you guys flown one quick question can you make this code available somehow or is it not done yet it\u0027s it\u0027s half done maybe we will be happy to share a half-baked in the sense that feature wise right it\u0027s not the complete implementation but yeah I think if we clean it up a little bit we\u0027ll be happy to share that portion thank you yeah okay great thank you very much touching happy thank you hey Julius thank you everybody who doesn\u0027t know me I\u0027m jealous floor I\u0027m a PhD student from the University of Duisburg Essen next slide please and as you might be aware we\u0027ve done an implementation of the anodic congestion control algorithm in the omnibus plus ion of discrete ventilation framework and we finally managed to update it to the latest version of the draft and so this talk is supposed to be a short independent validation of the ns3 model you already have up on github next slide please and since since the last version of the draft has had a focus on thatís competitiveness with lost base flows this I\u0027m focusing here on test case 5.6 where we\u0027re comparing how Natha behaves with long-lived TCP flows but in in this scenario we\u0027ve used SCTP instead of TCP because I don\u0027t know the TCP model in omlette very well and I know that the SDP model is quite good because she has lots of code with the FreeBSD kernel and CTP in this case also used in the arena congestion control there\u0027s only one thing I\u0027m not quite sure because so I don\u0027t know whether the extra energy the SCTP model uses is the same as TCP and no.3 because as you will see in in the following graphs the the frequency of the delay spikes you see induced by the loss based congestion control is higher for my plots I don\u0027t know where those come from I guess this is has something to do with TCP in na 3 I can just tell you that setp X on every other packet so in this test case we have a bottleneck with one megabit 16 milliseconds of propagation delay and the maximum cumulative 3 milliseconds this test case also specifies I think 30 milliseconds of jitter that we don\u0027t edit that to to our model and also we\u0027ve been using the perfect video encoder which means all its immediately always generates the perfect desired sending rate and also please "

    "text": "and so I would be expecting that RTP in this case or the flows in this case would get 1 point 5 mega bit each but as you can you see the second flow is somewhere around half of that next slide please so one one way to fix this would be to employ an approach as similar as what you see in the passive se where you compute a total left over rate so basically a difference between what your flow can with your traffic sauce can generate max and what you wanted to get and then just add it to the next flow in the same flow group next slide please yes so this is like the same scenario again with that fix and as you can see both lungs no get the maximum amount of they correct possible next slide please so yeah question is this an issue we should address questions how do we get this our max into the flow state exchange maybe in the register message but also we have two distinct cases where we are not limited by what our congestion control could deliver but maybe what and immediate source deliver so imagine we have a very old webcam which only does like 640 by 480 or sir yes how should we proceed there microwaves first of all thanks a lot for playing with this I mean quite nice to see second so the reason we didn\u0027t have two left over eight in this version is just I mean I was now looking back at the history of the old presentations you know we had it in the passive version and we ended up simplifying it and making it active and then the whole simplification process we removed that just to address the feedback from the group not be very happy to have that back in so I think it is an issue that we should address I think there is a small a small issue with the our group but that could be fixed and is probably not not a big thing actually if you could go back a few slides right now I\u0027m not 100% sure what\u0027s what\u0027s wrong here but something seems wrong because it seems that if there is a leftover rate to be added to the FAC our calculation of the very first flow the very flush flow is always gonna get zero right so something here seems to be in the wrong place oh yeah it might be sorry yeah yeah so this is a it seems like a minor thing I mean it\u0027s definitely doing the right the right thing yeah you\u0027re right just adding that up it may be that the plaster yellow has to go below if block or something like it\u0027s just a minor detail and we can "
