    "text": "haha I would like to share my opinion on the data sets I agree that the desert important thing when were training machine learning algorithm but I also agree with Diego they are an asset so although that in any idea world people will share them maybe this is not going to happen because I will be my algorithms will be as good as my data so why share it and have my competitors take advantage of that and I\u0027m from the Academy so I don\u0027t know but I\u0027m I don\u0027t have too much hopes on that but in any case if you take a look to other areas like computer vision public datasets typically are not used for training that\u0027s not true they are used for benchmark sorry for testing for benchmark so I train my computer vision algorithm with my own private data and then there are some public datasets where everybody goes and benchmarks they are going so it\u0027s like a public benchmark I am as good as I don\u0027t know I have a 92% accuracy with that public benchmark but this is just to for comparison from competition which isn\u0027t a bad thing maybe we can do that and it\u0027s a way for people to understand how good is algorithm that by vendor is selling me but public datasets for training I don\u0027t see it happening I just want to say I agree with his point commercial data production data no way that does for sure I mean that\u0027s something that sharing sharing sharing day timing data that has a real commercial values and value is something that we won\u0027t see happening but I was claiming is precisely for the way of validating the results and reproducing them which is benchmarking if you if you like and we one might make a reflection about on separate base unsupervised methods I\u0027m a little bit concerned that again deploying unsupervised methods in a running Network is something that I I don\u0027t see I mean frankly I cannot imagine telling my operations guys these will take control of the network and we\u0027ll learn by reinforcement another likable complicate that\u0027s really I mean on the in the lab you can do you can do this kind of experiments unless you can to some extent prove that the thing is going to behave I think when I talk about and supervise the other thing it just small for a particular problem in our domain that a is very you know this "
