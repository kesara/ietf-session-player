For in all of the different working groups, the leadership, you know, where you are with a particular document, all of that can be found in the data tracker. So if you start at the data tracker, and this is an example of the DNS ops 1, you can see that the blood the tabs across the top, which is about documents meeting history. Photos, etcetera, etcetera. So That's basically the landing page. The about page is the landing page for this working group. And from here, you can see you know, who are the chairs, who's the area director? What's the address of the mailing list? You can also look back on previous meetings. If you go to the document tab, you could see all of the published documents, all of the documents that are in draft state. And if you have any, questions or whatever, you can reach out to the chair. So this is where you start with any working group So then A most common question that people ask. As a new participant is, how does work? How does new work get started in the IITF? And There's, We we have a presentation on this that, the more each time I do this, I think we really need to revise that presentation and but we have, basically it's contribution driven.

Does that problem fit into the general scope of the IETF? So it's something that aligns with the kind of work that the IUTF does. So then is the scope well defined and understood? You know, so it's not a research topic. The research is basically complete. And we're ready to do the engineering work to actually define it. And then you can get agreement on timetables and milestones. And people that are willing to do the work. And if you have that list of things, Then Excuse me. Then you can start and proceed it with work through the IETF. The the down here is the link to the presentation I mentioned on the previous slide. Which talks in a lot more detail about various mechanisms for bringing into it. So the previous slide is sort of is a vision of how work happens. But the actual process steps for it. You know, this is the next step. How do you do it? The first thing you really need is to try and find some, collaborators with similar interests One way to do that is the the hot RFCs that are done later this evening. That that is but as often people that have a little idea and they want to see if anybody else has similar ideas. Similar ideas. Yes. Now, but can you go to the microphone? So he talked about the idea. What he will, come up with a new idea is like a problem, and we already have some kind of a proposal for solution, or we can simply come up with a problem statement which we'd like to propose and discuss in the Both are welcome or only proposal, some problem statement with some, idea proposal to solve.

Does anybody else this is a problem. And does anybody have any ideas on how to solve this problem? It's also, open. It just might be a little bit more conversation. Okay. Arms, The more you can narrow you know, The more you can narrow your scope down so that you can identify what working groups might be in interested in and the problem that always helps. Because the key here is is finding a set of collaborators that you can work with. That, you know, will help you get the kind of traction you need. And if it if you have it written down, then people like the area directors of the working group chairs can also say, well, know, I've read this and This is interesting, and I think you should talk to this set of people over there. So the, So you've you've identified some collaborators. That's great. You might write some initial Internet drafts or you might have some informal meetings a Barboff is basically an informal meeting. You can do that through the side meeting Wiki, which we'll talk about a little bit later, or you can just do that by collecting a group of people together. Maybe you'll talk to the area directors. One of the things as a new participant Historically, a number of areas have had individual dispatch sessions, But this time, we're doing an experiment where the Monday morning session is a dispatch for all of the IETF. And so this is another way as opposed to going through, abaugh. So you you come to the dispatch group and you say, here's my Here's my idea. And then there's a short, you know, a short presentation. Here's the idea. And then there's a discussion about Not the merits of the idea or any of those kinds of things or but it's what should we do with this idea? What should we do with this solution?

If it's something that there's already an existing working group for, then you can say, well, you know, this is a really interesting idea. And we think it's within the existing charter of the working group over there. Take it to that working group. Or the third thing would be This is a a problem that we really need a working group for. Let's let's think about the process for setting up a working group and begin that process, or we really think this is outside the scope of the IETF. So that's what dispatch is. If you just think of it in bringing something in and then patching it to where it needs to go. Yes, sir. Hi, Manny with Hashmesh. I figured out the hot RXC stuff, is was there a way to apply for dispatch session, or what's the process for that? Did I miss it? I guess I may I did it. You well, at this stage, you've you've probably missed it there. There were there are individual dispatch working groups. And so often you would, like the security area has a security dispatch 1. And so you would send an email to the chairs of that and say, this is a document that I would like to be considered in this agenda. For this particular meeting, the email would have gone to whoever's chairing that experiment. Got it. So it's a little bit fuzzier this time because of this experiment But as, you know, as we determine whether this experiment is successful or not, then there'll be we can update this information to say, you know, you need to send email to this So so so I guess for 120, then there will be emails ahead of time, or I should you know, send an email to the septic dispatch, for instance, and then Got it. Thank you. Yeah. The prior to this one, basically, the the dispatch meeting this time is going to be a joint meeting of all of the various dispatch working group. And so you would find the dispatch working group for the area that you think your work falls into."

Some of the working groups that have been around for a long time, sometimes you walk into the working and, you know, they're deep in the details of the protocol, and sometimes it can be hard to get a little bit traction when they're already You know, if somebody if a document is 4 years down the road, you know, they're probably going to be a little bit resistant to a comment that comes in and says, I have this new idea places, everything you've done for the last 4 years.

The IETF, as Karen said, does its work. The unit of work is working group. It's a collection of people working on the same sets of things. The IETF has I think it's a 127 right now working groups.

Meaning, they're gonna go back and post a note saying At the last working group, we agreed TCP meant I don't know. Trustful trusting compute trusting computer programs. Anybody disagree, speak up now. So the the the mailing list is the official place where decisions and census was made. All of the sessions are recorded using a a tool we sponsored called Midico.

For example, global access to the internet is 1 research. What does it mean if we're gonna have the entire globe hooked up to the internet. How do we handle that? There's a post quantum research group What is it? How do we do quantum key exchange? How do we handle how do we make things safe when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.

Welcome. I have been going to IETF Meetings since about 2000. So, been doing different roles throughout the years, but, I currently am working for the Secretariat. As Rich mentioned, we help organize the meetings and hopefully make everything work so that, you all have a great experience. During the week, if you need anything Please come to me. If I don't know the answer, I'm pretty determined to try to get you an answer. So, I'm just gonna do a quick overview of what's hap name during the week as far as, sessions and events go. Yep. And we go. There we go."

    "text": "So here at IETF 119, this is the over for you. Tutorial. That first one listed there. And as Karen mentioned earlier, we're going to have kind of an experimental session right after this. To explore, Mead echo that tool is used every So it's something you definitely wanna be familiar with. We did have 2 sessions last week. To review Mereco remotely. But if you haven't logged on, tried it, used the buttons, practice getting into the queue, this is a nice safe space where we can make mistakes and you can test your audio and video and all that. And we'll make sure that it's working for you. Tonight, or, technically this afternoon, there's a session called quick connections. You did need to sign up for that ahead of time just because we've got, in the room, that it's being held that we can't go over. So you, if you signed up for that, we'll see you later. That's a session where we match up experienced IT efforts. They're it's kind of like speed dating, but for IETF information, It's a room. There's tables. Experienced IT Effers are at each of the tables, and then the new participants kind of move around and and switch It gives you an opportunity to talk to Working group chairs, area directors, some IAB members, And so if you have very specific questions, what session should I go to? Or is there somebody here at the IETF that I should talking to about X. They have such a a wide breadth of knowledge that, they might be able to think of who to direct you tours or which working group to direct you to. So it's just a great, opportunity to meet a lot of people quickly."

    "text": "Monday night, we are having a new participant dinner. It's off-site. It's currently sold out. Again, we just have only so much space. If anything changes, as far as capacity for connections, I will email the new participants group So you can always keep an eye out for that. And then on, Thursday, we have a social hour and it's pretty much to just chat about your week. Some of the leadership shows up so you can talk to them. What went well. What did you have problem with? Can we do anything better? You could talk about the next IETF meeting coming up. Or just relax and can you unwind and, give one more day day to go after that on Friday. Everything's on the new participant page, you can always go there and check it out. You can always go back to the mailing list archives and all the messages that I've sent out for 119 are there. So if you think you might have missed something just go back and, check that list. Additional events happening here this week. So tonight. At 5 o'clock, we're going to have the welcome to country ceremony. This is not something we do at every IETF. This is very unique to coming to Australia. This is my first time in Australia, so I'm very much looking forward that. We've got the welcome reception. There'll be food and there. It is a cash bar, just FYI. We've got harsh, hot ROC tonight. Mr. Karen talked about that earlier. Again, if you just wanna see how does it work? What do people talk about? It's a great place to go and and see what people do as far as, presenting ideas we talked about sister's networking, Rich covered the plenary, and then there's a sister's lunch"

    "text": "on Thursday. If you have any questions about the sisters group, also I can answer questions afterwards. For sure. Still not sure where to start. There is a blog post listed up there where our director of communications worked with the, working groups, what's new, good topics for new participants. If you, take a look at that. Maybe it'll give you some ideas of which working groups to go to. This is all on the agenda. She can just browse the agenda and see going on. On the agenda, also, area direct the different areas transport security, all of them. Not every IETF meeting, do they offer the office hours, but at least a couple different groups. Will, offer offer the office hours at an IETF meeting. So if you're really, really interested in security, and you just wanna go chat with the area directors, you know, really about anything. That's a great opportunity for you to go in and, ask some questions. And that's all listed on the agenda. Connecting with other new participants. Of course, in person. We will have a sign, that's a meetup spot for new participants. And this is helpful especially if you're here on your own, you don't really know anybody. You can you know, send a message to the new participant mailing list and say, hey, anybody wanna go to lunch, anybody wanna go to dinner on any particular night meet at the new participant a meeting spot. And, I've seen it in action. Strangers come together. You may have new connections and you're talking about technical or government or various different types of things all night long. So I'll be sending a message to the mailing list to let you know where that sign is going to be."

    "text": "As you may have seen this base is really huge. And so I'm still trying to figure out where a good spot is for that. So I'll, I'll send a message to the mailing list You can chat via Zulip mailing lists, and anytime you want. Stopped by the registration desk. You can chat with us. We're happy to guide you in any way. Help any way we can Rich went over the registration desk. There's a technical help desk RC editor and I, Anne, I have desks. You know, you can just go up there and say hello and ask what they do. They'll be happy to explain if you need a little more information. Again, anything you're having problems with please send a message to support at ietf.org. And above, I I know this session, it's condensed. We threw a lot of information at you as far as how the IETF works. It's hard to do that in just an hour with an organization that's been around for so long and has changed morphed over time. But above, just enjoy yourself, meet people, we really hope you enjoy the experience and we're here to help you if you have any questions. Right. So if you can, if you have any questions, feel free to get in the queue. I do have two things I wanted to mention the first one is if you have any feedback on this particular presentation, please be sure to to us. I know it's a lot of information. You can send an email to EODER mailing list, or you can talk to any of us or do whatever. But, We're always looking at ways to improve the presentations. We'll be happy for that. Second thing I wanted to mention is are doing something this week that we haven't done in in a few years, and that's where having a couple technical tutorials. So one today at 3 o'clock is basically an introduction to BGP. So it's a you know, to the technology in general, and then there'll be a follow-up session on Thursday evening"

    "text": "Unfortunately, it it partially collides with the new participant social hour But it's, a deeper dive into BGP if you're looking, you know, what do you need to know about BGP if you are designing protocols. And so I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think both of those sessions if it if you have any interest in it, it should be really good. So I encourage you to add those to your calendar, if you have time and inclination. So, I still don't see anybody in the queue feel free to test out the queue to to raising hand if you want or Otherwise, Yeah. We're gonna just turn this room over real quick, and we're gonna enter a new meet echo room. So if you do wanna test out your meet echo and learn some of the fun buttons stick around. Otherwise, this session's over. So have a great week. Thank you."
