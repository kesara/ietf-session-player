I am one of your working group chairs West Hart and with me, as Joyce Salazar who is the other working group. The mailing list link is there. And we will move forward with our agenda for the day. It should be light, but we've added a few other things since and it was originally published, is last minute request. I'm sure all of you have seen the note well a bunch of times in your life. If not a bunch of times this week, As a reminder, you are should probably consult your lawyer because I'm not your lawyer and you should talk to them about what this means. But generally, it means that anything you say can be used in the future. For page two, we have the fact that the the H is controlled by a bunch of Bc, they're to whole how the standardization process works. These are probably all the ones that most should be familiar with about how the F functions, including copyright rates and anti harassment procedures and patents and everything like that. We have a code of conduct guidelines as a reminder you should treat everybody with respect. Speak slowly and limit the use of slang. Just rip dispute ideas using region arguments, not"

Conclusion. Thank you. This is the dance working group information page. That you have a data tracker, of course, we have a mailing list, and we have three drafts that we are currently considering and we'll talk more about those in a minute. The session is being recorded please, everybody do scan the Qr code we get a size of a room depending on how many people scan the Qr code. So if you think that this room is about right, then everybody should scan it. If you wanna be packed into a really small room in the future then don't scan it. So today's agenda, this was the working group here introduction. Thank you, Corey and Michael for being willing to take notes Michael actually not the room he's attending in another room. We greatly need note takers. So anybody that wants to help out the not taking link as in the agenda. It is a multi use tool so everybody can help contribute. I'm sure Corey would like more help. The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go to sort of the last call results for the two dance documents that were recently went through working group last call. We'll do some updates on the dance architecture with Ali and Michael. And then there's an open mic section and this is actually there's a couple of things that we're gonna bring up and discuss. Because a a couple of people have come forward with some last minute items, and we have plenty of time today so there's some extended use cases that will go over."

So thank you everybody that was involved in that took some time too. Give some notes and pointers and suggested text and questions. So a brief summary of of the things that we got. Thank you. For the client Id draft, there was a request that issued say what type of our content it expects that but of course, there you can read bullet points. Right? So I'm just gonna talk a little bit about the background and and contact that I remember for it. But, like, those are, like this summarized. Bids. So then there were also some requests for, like a reference check for extensions that are involved like clarify if if it's gonna be Rf c six six six versus our eighty four forty six also do a reference check for the support at Tls version. Right? And they architecture document. Like, if it's gonna be referenced in the current Id, draft or not? I forgot to take off my mask No wonder Was it was getting hard to breathe. Sorry about that. So Yeah. So check if the architecture document is going to be a reference or not? And then also there was a request for clarity on the client named limit definition, like, how it was defined if I remember correctly, Also people wanna like a use case for mixed environments in the terms of the certificate authorities this was quite a a lengthy conversation. Then let let's see."

And and the way that it was defined. Right? And then there was also a suggestion for more stiff requirements to improve the interoperability and reduce code complexity. So does anybody have any comments questions? Complaints about client Id. Draft. If now. Then let's go to the next one. Alright. So for the client off draft. One thing that was required was to to to add main examples. Also for a day in the use of wild cards, dane Pa. Let me see. There was some discussion about the the potential need to encode the transport level label. This was highlighted by Michael Richardson. There was also a request for clarity on the security considerations. From those that there. As well on the exception that allows for this should. In keyword when using the x five zero nine certificate. And whether it should be changed to a must. There there were some smaller warning suggestions work suggestions and and it's And... Yeah, Like, the conclusion is similar for both. Right? That an update is needed. And and we're waiting for that, but they're both ready to go. And on that note, the next slide, please?"

Anybody have comments about the last call, otherwise, we will push that forward as soon as the officers ready and we'll send it to I thus call and all the next steps to go along with it. After remember, which buttons to push in the data tracker because it keeps changing on us. After that, we are gonna talk about updates to the dance architecture. We hadn't an enter interim meeting in January? January or February. Anyway, where we went through the list of open issues and had some good discussion a smaller group than this and Michael and Ali you. Hopefully, we'll talk about it. I don't know if While he is here at Michael Said he was falling asleep So Michael, you may be on deck if you're still here. Is either one of them here They both asked for agenda time. Let's just keep in mind that time zone difference also made it a bit difficult for people from the west. But... Yeah. Unfortunately, Michael just wrote a bit ago and said he was falling asleep, so he may have just fallen asleep because it literally five minutes ago. With that then, this will be an even shorter meeting, but we do it too extra any other business sections that we're go over. So why don't we start with Rick? Rick, I know you don't have slides and I believe that he is not able to see video, but hopefully, he can at least talk to us through audio. So, Rick, do you wanna talk about your use case?"

And the other hand, back, back kind structure is being more and more complex resulting in composing single web service over the multiple service providers So in this slide, we have the Easy side on the left side, and we have payments side on the right side. So you go to the Ec side and the you press the go to check the that you will be redirected to the payment side is. You don't know who it's running the actual payment side, it it is separate from the easy side domains. And you your guy to enter your credit card numbers or three to secure passcode and Diabetes ids and if you and everything and you you will be related three I have to that back to the side. And... But how do... How do you know the actually this easy side on the payment side I related in the in the context of our business. We we don't know. We can check the each host integrity by using a Tls, but we cannot know how the relationship on the each hosts sony slide.

In in this slide, pay dot net and dot com one dot com is have some kind of contract and the also pay easy to come and pay to dot net is also have some kind of.

So this is the brief explanation of my research if you have any comments thank you very much. So this is not two things One. This is not using Dane at the moment. We'll get back to that in a second. And the other thing is this is not client it's more server side, but it was very related to dana and we're really the only current active dane working group. And I thought this would be of interest to the audience. Did you look into using Tls records? Or why were you using text records would be one question I have. This is the actual signature.

If february can hear me. I'm very puzzled as to why you want servers to sides the other servers public key. This is rather manageable because it removes the ability. Of the peer operator to update their key independently of the... You know, the other party there that related to it seems sufficient given that both sides are gonna use Dns s. To just assert the relationship. I don't see any need for covering key material in these records. Can you explain why the keys need to be tested by somebody who is not in control of the team. So sorry the the first one is What I use keyless a wiki key. Right? So he was asking why you need to know any servers Go ahead. Yeah.

They after they different entities in the business context but the from the user end users point of view there they're all just single with studies. See. So they should be corporate to the to they should be they should call corporate to express the the entire service not separate companies. Okay. Thank you, Victor you're back in Yes. Mh. Okay. So we'll lay a me or go first Thank you for this presentation. So I question. If you trust the of. I you're you're a little quiet. Can you speak a little bit louder please? Okay? Yeah. I'll try to be a little bit louder. Does this sound better? Yes, please. Thank you. Yep. If you trust the tls sort of on the origin side on, unlike, the host side on the example you gave and the websites authenticated with Tls is pointing at another business that they have us have relationship with how does this kind of, like, improve I guess as an end user of my trust towards that versus just like, okay, that website has link to that, that website is behind Https.

It's very difficult to show a user when something is not there. So... U. You know, this would help to know that you are getting to the right payment site Right? That you're not going to the wrong one. But how do you know whether when when there is no link at all when when there is no link, then you have no way to really tell the user that that there should be one. Yeah. Sure that that is the one point into more just something for this actually I I don't I have currently not yet implemented that kind of something to to something to do with the such situation. So I know that does has such kind of the only on such situation. So I think I can use the same approach, like creating a new field on the implementation. So But currently, we don't have the any anything to deal with that such situation. Okay. Thank you. The entire web industry has battled same problem. You're not alone.

Michael didn't wake up. Participants list. Alright. I think unfortunately, with sleeping participants and missing participants, I think that we are going to conclude today. This is... We we will give a chance for, you know, any other business there are lots of use cases that have been discussed in multiple places. Jacques actually gave a great presentation at I can in the Dns x symposium about how he is doing things with Dane two link things like national driver's license and things so that so that cross so that companies and other companies, countries and other organizations can verify somebody else a driver's license using T records, which is an interesting form of dane client to client a type verification mechanism. Anybody else have any topics they wanna bring up today at the microphone? Otherwise, we will call it good for the day. John? John Levin levine. Since we seem to have lots of free time. I noticed in the architecture document, there's a whole for what to do... What to say about mail."

Yes. But why I why don't I summarize what I want say just in case somebody hates it, please. Okay. There's two actually two overlapping protocols or submission there's S p. And the key difference between them is that was submission you know who you're talking to and with sm you don't. So and it turns out people have been using client certificates to authenticate submission, like food for for decades. And so so so the use cases they suggest both of of submitting of of validating the certificate directly and it's validating via a of the ace the sign certificate are well established in the in the mail world and doing them through Day makes perfect sense. Okay. The other thing is it sort of what hands about well maybe you could use it for Sm. And the answer is in general, you couldn't... There's some really niche cases, like basically, were you're using Sm as a tunnel from, like branch office of the main office to get stuff to the main server. So there's a little niche there. So again, you know, it normally normally people use a Vpn. But, you know, you if you hate Vpn or something using using a client through certificate to to basically to do a mail Vpn would work to. So why you stayed there, because Victor has a question for you. Hi, Victor. So in fact, I believe you're you're missing part. And I've heard your actual requests from users or the thing that client certificates in Sm can fill. Which is that some organizations actually want to know that mailed from a particular business partner. Is actually coming at the sort of transport layer. From one of the you know, exit nodes that's supposed to be contacting them. They want the client identity for permission"

    "startTime": "00:30:03",
    "text": "for, you know, integrity, and I spam, whatever. But they want to know who the client is. And it certainly gift also clients opportunity to present the positive identity at the transport layer so that you know, their reputation can be determined you know, via a dynamically presented client certificate. If you have one present, if we have a reputation for you we'll apply it. So it's sort like to like Spf certificates what really works. Right. Okay. Yeah. So there's interest in that. I know how to implement it. Haven't implemented it. Yet, it hasn't been a priority for me. But if enough people show up on the pros users was to say we really need it. It's not difficult to implement, especially once the dance documents mature. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't... I mean, the scaling properties are horrible. I could use imagine if you had a handful of business partners knowing with took off lawyer. So so the sailing is fine at the very least to get an audit trial. You don't need any scaling, you know, car if a client comes in and says my day record is published at fix. And presents a certificate that matches the dane we can now sign from a Dns identity. I don't Of like, no I more thinking of the scaling of like, once once you know let's ask what you do about it. Well, at the very least you can log and then it's in your audit turn yeah. But you may be able to in fact say, know, for my purposes mail from my business partner must come with verified client credentials, I will refuse mail from business partner x. Unless it does so and that doesn't scale beyond the specific relationships. Yeah. One now would D mark. But, yeah, I I can... I can make a paperwork hour pull request back. Yep. Okay. Right."
