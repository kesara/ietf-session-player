    "text": "going to show you what we think the killer app for these things are but before i get there i\u0027m going to show you how these things work so here\u0027s how they work we have the hasher who holds the vrf secret key you can see the blue box and the verifier which holds the vrf public key so when the verifier would like something hashed what it does is it sends this input over to the hasher and the hasher performs a secret key operation on it to obtain a value that\u0027s called the proof ok the proof is then sent back to the verifier now the verifier will check if this proof is valid so there\u0027s this verify function that uses the public key the input and the proof to check if they validate and if it does validate that it can obtain the hash value by basically computing a hash over the proof ok so what\u0027s happening here is sort of a two-stage computation you use the secret key to get the proof that can only be done by the hasher and then you verify using the public key and then the actual hash value is computed directly from the proof so you\u0027ll notice that this proof to hash function is unclean it\u0027s a function that can be computed by anyone ok so that\u0027s roughly how you use a vrf what it\u0027s doing is you\u0027re forcing the hashing to be done only by the holder of the secret key but anyone can verify the correctness of the hash ok next slide so what properties do we want from this thing so we want basically the same kind of properties you might want for any kind of hash function so for example with sha-256 like a regular hash function it\u0027s the case that for every input there\u0027s a single unique output it\u0027s not possible for you to hash some valley was taught sha-256 and get multiple different outputs there\u0027s only one correct output so we want the same thing with the vrf what we want is we want a one-to-one relationship between the input and the proof ok so there\u0027s only one unique proof for the input given the secret key more formally next slide what we\u0027re saying is is that even an adversary that knows the secret key cannot cannot actually find two distinct hash values that are valid for the same input ok so this this property that there\u0027s a one-to-one relationship between the input and the hash has to hold even for an adversary that knows the secret key ok and the way we actually build these things you can think of it in the following way you can think of this proof value as a deterministic digital signature so what I\u0027m saying what i mean by deterministic i mean that given the secret key and the input there\u0027s only one possible output that you can get and similarly you want to have this one-to-one relationship in the hash value so the way we do that is use a regular hash function like sha-256 for example ok so that\u0027s one property we want that we have from regular hash functions that we also need to have BRF next slide ok what else do we have with regular hash functions we have collision resistance so for every X slide for every input sorry for every output we can only find a it\u0027s very very hard to find two inputs that map to the same hash out but that\u0027s basically the same thing that we have with collision resistance and this property also needs to hold even for an adversary that knows "

    "text": "the secret key ok so that hash sure knows a secret key it should still be hard for this guy to find collisions in the hash function this is very similar to sha256 ok next slide ok now we\u0027re getting down to like what is special about the vrf there\u0027s this third property called pseudo randomness ok so I\u0027m showing the vrf operating in a different way in this slide what\u0027s happening here is that the hasher is getting um an input he\u0027s hashing that to obtain the hash value and then he\u0027s sorry he\u0027s hatching how to obtain the proof value and then he\u0027s taking the proof value hashing that again and getting that the vrf hash value ok so as you can see on the right of the slide what I said may not have made perfect sense but just look at what it says on the right of the slide what\u0027s happening is that the hasher is just sending over to the verifier without the input without the proof without anything and what the vrf is going to do is if I just see the hash value I have no idea what input this hash value corresponds to okay so the idea here is we want to prevent dictionary attacks if I give you a hash value you should have no idea to figure out where this what this hash value corresponds to you give it only knowledge of the public key so more formally next slide this property has to hold um for assuming that the adversary only knows the public key but does not know the input or the proof if he only sees the hash he can\u0027t figure out what input it corresponds to okay and you\u0027ll notice that all of the three properties I\u0027ve mentioned here have hold under the condition that the vrf keys are generated properly so the killer app for this is we have a setting where at least in my opinion and part of the reason i\u0027m doing this presentation is to understand if there are other apps out there that we haven\u0027t thought of yet the idea here is that we somehow have generated the the vrf keys properly so for instance we could have an outsourced data structure that has been set up these vrf keys and has generated a hash based data structure so for example it could be a merkel tree it could be n sec 5 you might have observed our presentation in indiana stop whatever data structure you want used with use with the vrf instead of a regular hash function okay so we have this hash based data structure next slide and this hash data structure is shared with the verifier next slide so what we get from the vrf is that this guy even if he knows the entire hash based data structure all of the hash values he has no idea what\u0027s stored in this data structure because he can\u0027t figure out the correspondence between the hashes and their pre images and the inputs okay so that\u0027s the idea with the vrf next slide on the other hand if this guy actually wants to query the data structure he needs to interact with the hasher okay so in order to query the data structure he will take his input send it over to the hasher the hasher will compute the proof using the secret key send it back to the to the verifier and then if the proof checks out the verifier learns the hash and if not he\u0027s going to reject um reject the response from the hasher okay "
