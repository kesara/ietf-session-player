You're gonna present your updates we'll ensure things after I'll be at Stuart's right here. After you get through it, we'll then switch back to the architecture in the yard this morning, but let me bring up your slide, sir. Sounds good. Thank you. And I went with the deck that was labeled latest. Figuring that was the latest. Yes. Thank you. Everyone. Tommy Jensen back. We're here to talk about encrypted DNS server redirection. Working not working? Not working. Just tell me when you are advancing. Alright. Next slide. So, in a nutshell, we made a pretty big update, but it all comes down to one thing, which is now there's only one mode of redirection. It was clear that the working group didn't have consensus for doing anything that allowed you to redirect from one server with domain a to another server that could claim domain that would end up not being able to claim domain a, So it's not there anymore."

The other method has been removed. Pretty much it. So, we're gonna take a few minutes and just go through the list feedback items that came up next slide, please. We need Ben called out that we need to do a rephrase on SC on service binding record, usage and he's absolutely correct. As always, that's pretty trivial. We'll be doing that. Next slide, please. This is a good one. So we talked about using delegated credentials because that's really the ideal way for to address the root cause of why people wanted to redirect across names is we wanna shed traffic off to a 3rd party. That we contract with the take our traffic, but we don't necessarily trust with access to our private and the good news is there's a standard for that called delegated credentials. Great. The existing text isn't sufficient because it it says servers can use it. That's great, but that implicitly places a burden on clients that they have to expect it because it could happen so we need to clarify the text and say when it can and cannot happen. That text doesn't exist yet. If you have any commentary about how you would like it to exist please let us know. Next slide, please. Clarifying the differences when used with the resolver originally discovered you DDR. Went with the spirit of things when we wrote what we did. We is there's only this one real difference, but Ben's correct. There are other differences. Such as the s, the S and I won't have the domain name like it would if you already knew the server's identity without having to use something like DDR."

And and this we currently the thing we were trying to prevent was having a chain of redirections where they were all decently linked except one And it being so short, meant you actually had to come back up the chain and work some things our intention was always don't ever do that. Always start over. But As written, it means that we did that by, setting a min, so we didn't have to do this constantly. Ben suggests instead, we just call the redirection silly and go back, and we're in agreement on that. It's better than TTL script stretching, which means we'll need to add some tech the considerations, more strongly pointing out the burden on a server of redirecting through short TTLs, you are about to bring all your clients back if that's not what you wanted. Next slide, please. Alright. And so then, Manu raised a a good point about what happens when the redirection target goes offline. So this was something that I was actually surprised because I thought we had said it and didn't. It was, like I said, on the previous slide, it was always our intention that redirections are not stateful along the path. Whatever nodes, that a client went through to get to the final destination or not relevant other than we had to authenticate our way through. Once the redirection has expired, we go all the way back to the beginning and start again the only a dress that we were configured without a band and we wanna keep honoring that. When it wants to change its redirection mind, not when an intermediate changes its redirection mind. This is a different case of the same scenario. Which is, you know, the server disappeared. Oh, well, that was the one that was recommended along a chain to me,"

So of kind playing chicken in the hopes we get at a it and then make that this GitHub. But anyway, So just like a couple knits, as far as how we're referring to DDR, I think, is the main issue I have that I would love to see resolved before we adopt. Just so that if we adopt a document, it's not inaccurately describing our other RFCs. Sure. So thing. Specifically,"

    "text": "if this document seems to be referring to DDR as The bootstrapping from IP address of an unencrypted resolver. Which is one of the modes that DDR supports, but it's not the only mode. Oh, there. So, like, I think a number of times, like, essentially, we should probably scrub the whole document for that. And maybe come up with, like, some good terminology or, like, a a shorthand say of, like, you know, DDR from unencrypted IP. I don't know what that is. The good news is the very wise and intelligent co authors of DDR. Yes. Did name those modes right. So that name in we just need to put more often and use that name instead of named DTR. Makes sense. I think also, you know, some of this around when we have multiple SVCB responses, I I I know, like, somewhere in the traffic does mention like, oh, and there could be multiple. Here. But that's, like, listed way down. It'd be nice to, like, explain that further up and kind of related to that, I'd love to see some like, just examples of resource record responses. So, like, it's very clear when we're talking about I'm doing a lookup based on the resolver name. Like, what? Specifically is that and how does look? that But I think one of the bigger again, kind of related to the relationship with DVR looking at what DDR does specify that's not the unencrypted mode So, like, in section 5 of DVR, we have that, you know, the designation from a resolver name. Right? So this is the case where I look up the underscore DNS SVcb record, service binding record. For the name of the resolver And I get back the info, which As far as I can tell is like the same thing we're doing. Here. So I wanna understand, like, There there there's a place in this document where It it says your designation from DDR is when you went from a unencrypted to encrypted."

So Then if scoped. like, what I'm curious about is, like, if we need to rephrase this, what is the difference between redirection and designation from a name. exactly. Right. So In the section 5 case when you have a name. Exact When you take those 2, is there a difference? It's a good question. I mean, I'm not gonna try and answer it because I don't like mumbling at the mic. But, that is a good point. Because at that point, they do bear a lot of similarities. Yeah. I So for 1, scoping because currently, wherever we say DDR, what we really mean is the from IP in section 4 and We have to do that. That's absolutely the case. After that, then yes. More open ended that I don't know how we'll do yet is calling out to an implementer how this does or does how this Lives with section 5. Right. And that might result in changes, but I don't know yet. So I guess in in terms of just wanna understand, like, when you think of redirection, So we go from a name what are we validating in the certificate of the thing we got redirected to. Has to cover the original name as well as its new name. Well, not not anymore. Right? In in this case, the name is not allowed to change. So there is no new name. Okay. So if the name doesn't change, What does change? How like, Is it? IP address or available because you can have added records and say, but, hey, off of this, Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, doe.example is who I first spoke with it 1234 And then it I I do EDSR and it tells me Oh, I'm redirecting you to do a dot example at 5678. And those could be in 2 different geolocations."

If you learn about something and you're like, oh, that's even better. Fantastic, but we're actually more worried about preserving interop like please don't redirect me somewhere that doesn't support what we're currently talking over. I could be sick. Ipv4daw.etcetera. Okay. So so that makes sense. But I I wonder if then essentially, like, redirection becomes You know, it it it is is a subset of Designation is a subset of DDR that we essentially did not specify fully in DDR that's not prohibited by, like, I mean, you could do it today, essentially. So I I I we get to the point where this is not really A normative change. Instead, It's like a heuristic Both on the resolver configuration side, where resolvers as, like, Hey. You know, when when when you as the dough resolver yourself, Receive a query, for what your resolvers are. And when you respond with yourself, because you always could have responded with yourself? Yes. Make sure that the addresses that are hanging off of that service Are the ones you think are best? For the client, Not your own addresses. Yes. If that's what you wanna do. And then clients, you know, When you connect to a doe server, Yeah. Even if you're happy using dough, Do the DDR lookup because you're not trying which protocols you're trying to see do you have a better address for me. And and so it's, like, it's not new protocol mechanisms. It's a a a way to use things to"

And I hear what you're saying because right now, the tech does specify to clients like, look, if the server thinks it's redirecting you, but clearly it's taking you to the same place, you can just chill and not do it in a self loop. And basically, what you're saying is pointing out to resolvers resolver implementers like, hey, section 5 of DDR has you do this. When doing this, which is subtly different, here's your gotchas because if you put the same IP address, you are redirecting to yourself advertising yourself I I yeah. I I don't I don't think it's different. From section 5 of DVR, it's just more specific and with an intent to optimize the location that you're routed to. Yes. Which you Again, like, DDR, like, section 5 doesn't give an opinion on why you're doing this. It's just the mechanism. Correct. And this is, like, now you have a reason to do this. I mean, for what it's worth, there are cases where, you know, we are currently using like, like, like, like, like, dough. Not quite with this. But like a, a doe lookup of our own resolver name, just like the AA and AAA query, food, to restyle ourselves to see, like, oh, did the unicast put me on the bad spot? And now I'm gonna move the better spot. So, like, This absolutely works. And, like, and, like, I haven't used this particular mechanism. With this spelling of it, but, use the A and AAA query version of it, and it definitely helps performance. So That's good. But I I I One of the reasons I'm kind of pushing on us a bit is I think that it can actually help simplify the document. And by leaning on We have DVR already. We already did the security considerations. We already did all these other things. We you can kind of explain less and just say, like, this was always allowed But this thing is a cool performance trick. So it tightens it up, I think. So just to"

What you're really saying is more direct references and less redefining of the mechanism. Like, lean on it and then encapsulated in guidance as to why we're using it. Is that right? So instead of saying this is a new thing, say, like, DDR section 5, Let you do this. But, hey, cool trick. You can use that to steer steer yourself on the same protocol to a better instance, to a better set of addresses, because using an encrypted resolver can see your client IP and can do a potentially a better of steering I think I think we're gonna have to think a little about the use case. My mind's flashing back to some fact that Ralph gave it a previous draft version about us using reusing the SUDN and conflating Thai, DDR state with EDSR state and making sure that the server knows when the client is intending which because there is a subtle difference. Or we just give the guidance that says, know, always send it back recognizing that if it's a redirect to yourself, they're not going to treat it redirect. And then we need to be a little more normative with clients about Not following those because they'll happen. So Right? So and partly, one one one of the proposals would be, like, don't even need to, you know, call it EDSR or what it like, you know, it's just you know, using DDR to redirect you. That that's a name. Well, other than the section 4 case. Right? Sure. Sure. Using name name name based designation. Yeah. Then, yes. Right. It is using section 5 of DDL. Naming is hard. But no. I meant when using section 4 when I don't have a name yet that I trust. Learned a resolver from Yeah. Doctor. That's different. Yeah. That one, Yeah. That one's tricky."

Are there any cases where we really need a signal from the client that I am trying to do this to see if there's a better address Because I mean, it seems like a very reasonable behavior in, like, today, you could have the behavior where a client does a DDR query to an encrypted resolver Like, you you you can you you can do that today. Like, you can do that with, like, quality and quality. They will respond with themselves already. And clients should not go bonkers just tear down the connection immediately, like, if it gives it back the same information. Right. So can we have this thing and specifying that you shouldn't tear down your connection and go crazy if the address is the same is good. Specifying that if you get a different set of addresses, That's probably a hint that you should go somewhere else is also really good. But does there need to be any more signaling than that? Because, like, why would the server not. The resolver will not always provide what it thinks is the most optimal route the client Is the intent of Section 5 to have provided the client with some information about the name or all of the information about the name, because that that's really the underlying because a redirection wouldn't wanna tell you all the places you could go. It would tell you here's where I wish you would go. I I So I I believe that Section 5 of GVR, along with kind of any resource record. Like, as the definition of how we do it, it doesn't have an intent to show you all addresses or not like, that is kind of up to the deployment, But generally, I my impression is, like, When we do a DNS lookup, we addresses don't get all"

I think it's a reasonable assumption that that's the case. Okay. Emmanuel. Are you suggesting to redirect directly to the what I would call unicast. So typically, you will get an unicast address of a resolver and you know, a data center pop goes down, you would go to the next one. Minencing of EDSR where will be valuable is you will redirect the clients to a Unicasso SAIDIP which sends you to a specific cluster, from the presence of what even So if you do that at the very beginning, then clients may end up on the cluster, which will go dumb, dumb, because fiber cut, because maintenance, how do they go back to the endcast? Is that Thomas? Go Right. So so I mean, I I think certainly that's the type of you know, heuristic that we need to describe in the document, like, that that's what the document's for to say, how do you correctly handle this? I think you can do that within the context of saying this really is you know, just a DVR query to yourself. I believe at this point, all clients Like, I'm not aware of any clients that are doing the query to do to intentionally redirect themselves. And so they're not gonna have the problem right now. Of, like, existing ones getting stuck. A unicast, but I think what would happen organically Because I think it could happen, right, because, like, for example, like, when our iOS client, we'll do, you know, if you if I've configured it to use a certain doe server, The way we do it today is we look up the name of that Dose server on the open network with whatever The know, the the local network resolver is. We get an anti cast address. We then set up doe. If we ask for it again, To the doe server, maybe give us a sendingcast, maybe give us a unicast. Fine. Fine."

I think the further mode will have to be pretty explicitly defined. Because awesome wise. We're going to have, like, a bunch of clients limbo Okay. And we're gonna close the queue after Ralph. And so a bit core, clarifying question for for Tommy, actually, mostly because my understanding for this always was we are having Section 4 DDR, meaning it's coming from an IP address. And whatever we end up with with redirection, We always would have to prove the IP address for the certificate. Otherwise, we We're not allowed to use. And what you're proposing is a think for section 5 now, do you see that there's kind of across over from section 4 to section 5? Right. I'm not saying that you cross over from section 4 to section 5. Like, if you start with section 4 and that's the only way you ever got. Encrypted DNS. Then you're kind of stuck in that trust model. Yes. However, If you have DNR, Or if you have manually configured it because, like, We we can have someone manually configure their resolver name. To be you know, dns.google or, I mean, like, or whatever you want it to be. That we have an application specify that's what they want.

I'll give it quite simple, like, right, there is a need for us to host, encrypted DNS service on CPEs. For instance, one example I'll take rather than going through all of them is security. We do, filtering. We do filtering for IoT devices space on a manufacturer's description. So we need to identify and, each device and then do the filtering, for basically preventing as to malicious domains. And, prerequisite to this was, like, we needed CQCP. So we already have CQCP. You can move on to the next slide. So There was a lot of work that happened to SecPs. We have hard and opened the BRT. It was part of the, PRPL foundation work that happened Now we have, a power DNS, DNS test, and several other, tNS forwarders that could be run-in containers on home routers. With that, what we are looking is we are we've already started shipping that and already available on millions of, CPEs already. The challenges next slide Yeah. This is all how these CPs are secured. Just a one on one in case if anyone is interested Next slide. That's that's the place where all the work happened with regard to hardening the CPE's next slide. Next slide. Yeah. This is the one that's interesting is that we we were looking for ways to, make an authenticated, connection possible for a client to either use GD or, a way of doing it or DNR way.

We were to the business equation, and we finally got those years working. But it eventually turned out that we are, like, dependent on the CA 4,000,000. So certificates, for and that created us with regard refreshing these certificates and all of that and the timeliness of refreshing these certificates. The I was looking for any other way of doing it in a much, that reduces the dependency on the CA. The I was looking at some of the proposals like star, which was discussed in academic working group, but that seems to be more specific to, downstream sedience. Next slide. Yeah. There were 2 other options which is which is delegated credentials of 9 constraints, name constraints, as we know, none of the CA supports it, especially the cap form does not encourage it, and they don't like doing that because of auditing, had proposed dealers delegated credentials. It the the working group had several concerns over using that, right? So Either Hi there. We speak with what we are doing today. Right, like, managing, working with the CA in a traditional way and getting all these certs and managing like what we're doing. We do something else to make our operational, aspect much more easier.

Is a hard problem. The intention is to have the conversations around the issues. Potential approaches we might, do to address it. And so we get the the wheels turning because leading in the Vancouver the next IETF 120, maybe we can have something on, you know, draft or some draft active by that point if people are have some ideas. Or we, have decided the problem is intractable, and we're gonna bump it up to the ISG and say, well, you guys solve this and let you know when it's done. Which which was brought up this morning, by the way, by by the crew. So that's remains an option. As always, with the IETF things, you know, there's the always the possibility we say we can't address this that that we're not going to because we can't get consensus is the option that we find some middle ground compromise where not everybody happy, but we get a solution that lets us move forward. And then there's the other approach where we has something brilliant, and it comes in and saves the day. So they're all on the table. So with that opening, have a discussion. How do we approach this problem? And What what's what are your thoughts on the problem space? Are is it a valid problem? It a valid problem to solve? And I've never had to have anybody in EDD prompted to have an opinion. And I'm kind of being shocked. Oh, Ecker. Thank you for the save Ecker. Go ahead. Go ahead, Eric. Sure. Just waiting for the me. I coulda warm up. Yeah. I'm late. Pre now this problem, frankly. This is not the best architecture ever seen you know, it's not really because it really matched the end to end design of the internet.

A couple of comments to make here. 1st of all, I think Teeter's done a great job over the find the problems, basically, we should really thank him for that I also agree that there's a problem that's worth solving And I think you'll also like to say that perhaps there's problem needs to have a broader scope to because it may even for other reason around securing the local network. And if we move into that broader scope, it's probably not going to be appropriate for this working group So my inclination at the moment we beat this is draw a lightener of the sand under the, say, VIP dragons and say, let's say, let's say, something that we recognize as a problem, but we don't think we can solve it in this working group. Perhaps it could be sold to someone else I'd like someone to contradict that if I'm completely badly mad about it. Yeah. Uh-oh. Take your mind. Sure. One comment for you too. My hope is that we we can pull a rapid out of the hat, Jim. And it's a hard problem, but maybe we can find a a narrow solution. Salsa here. Yeah. I think there is a difference between securing other devices versus your home router. If you look at all the home routers that we have, we are using internal PK to manage all of them. So, basically, they are provisioned with We have a root CA that's installed on the CP, it's managed by our cert certificate enrollment and all. If you look at many of the IOT devices, right, they you don't talk to them directly. You go to the entity who's managing that and through that, you talk to that. So eventually, it's like even if they are using self sense certificates, you don't get to see that. Right? So the problem with even if I'm talking if I'm using an app to talk to my, CP today."

Right? And we need to take care to work there, and and the I don't see how that pre provisioning step can be bypassed here for us to do anything there. So it's it's a problem for other devices a problem that could be solved by different techniques. This problem cannot be solved because there is no bootstrapping mechanism. Okay, Ernie. Talking as a year is possible for this working group. Like I said, this morning, for the benefit of the pellet we are not there, One outcome of the discussion here is that the problem is broader maybe, and then we may want to get above and creating a working group on this.

And because it was seeing these so many sub domains, and we were sending all this request using at May. They basically started denying denial. And then we contacted them they realized that they were under some sort of task attack where someone was creating so many sub domains with the random, random names and then coming and asking them for cert. So, basically, we ended up with some CA which, with a who have we had a business agreement. And basically, because dependency is like we are managing those minions of CA's and then every x number of days, we go and ask for a new advocate and all of that and meeting those SLAs with regard to the time duration before which we could get a cert and then pre provision that, again, on the CPEs. So that turned out to be, like, a lot of dependencies I and I saw, like, lots of work was happening with regard to, like, especially if it's sedience and downstream sediences, there's a lot of work happening with regard to star certificates or deal is delegated credentials, which seemed like a much smaller in scale and and they seem to have figured out a way to do it in a way. Reduces the dependency on CA. Right? So I was thinking, why can't we try any of these techniques that was applicable there and use it in in our deployment. So that prompted me for this solution.

In the way you're trying to use them. And that's and that's, like, that's a Tyler considerate property or bad. And so like, you know, I mean, like, it's in like the inherent property is each CPE, it is own thing, has to have its own security boundary and means that it's own credential.

So, like, like, that's a management problem, but, like, the management problem their differentities. It's not the same thing.

How we got here, Lars, was we had a a a draft submitted and discussed repeatedly at the things which failed working group adoption hall. It failed to work group adoption well because we hit an architectural sort of approach where some a large portion of the the ADD Group, Fossil Group should be the work should be adopted, we also had a set of strong voices who said that work should not be adopted.

Between Ben and the Tommy's, some of this would go away if we also supported opportunistic DDR such that we would just Trust. Encrypted DNS, when it's when we find it available on the same IP address, with zero checks which the RFC allows, except none of us do it. Because we don't want to. And You know what? I'll let you explain that on the mic because that confuses me. So Ideally. Ideally, we can use DNR where the network tells us all the metadata we need upfront, and then we can authenticate and clearly, the how we authenticated is very complicated, but if we can solve this problem, then we greatly improve the value of and the broadness of adoption of DNR that this work produced So I'm I'm not any kind of hat wearer, but that's why I think this is in and I do think we should work on this.

Then we will have failed, our our court charter, which is finding discovery mechanism for clients. Because there's a set of environments here that today can't participate in the discovery encrypted DNS resolver successfully. So this is sort of It's at the court, but I I get you also acquainted. We don't wanna go too far with that. So that said, shall we do a So, Tommy, you want Thomas? To clarify on this, me Polyapple. What you're saying about people not wanting to do the opportunistic Can you explain So if a CPE is using A private address space. IP address. They're not gonna get verified to work. They're not gonna get a certificate that covers 192, 162. Like, that's or 10 dot address. They're not gonna get that. So, again, like, you know, what we support for the opportunistic is Yeah. If you are running your encrypted resolver on that same address and you're in private address, space. And you have, A certificate with any name in it that's just, like, A non expired cert that we trust to some root I don't care if you use the same name and the same key across all of your CPEs. I can't verify it. I'll use it. That's opportunistic. So but, like, so they don't want to do that. But what do they want to do? They wanna do DNR instead? Or they verify.

Right? It it would even work with self signed certificates. It wasn't right. No. One couldn't if I may. It can. Yes. The text of RFC 9462 essentially says that if you wanna support opportune a a client may support opportunistic by which it's not at that point required or might you you're not supposed to check the name at that point, but you may check whatever else you want. And that's what Apple is doing is checking other things, like, does it parents to a known root? But that is optional. You could be RFC compliant doing that, or by simply ignoring everything about the cert, let it be self signed from 20 years ago. That be RFC compliant as well. Yeah.
