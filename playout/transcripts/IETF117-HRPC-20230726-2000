But, essentially, I wrote a book that was published in 2021. called the rise of digital repression. which talks specifically about how different different leaders around the world, autocrats as well as democratic leaders are using digital technologies to advance your political objectives.

We'll go to the next slide right here. And and, essentially, the the the big idea is that we've seen a shift happen when it comes to the use of information and communication technologies in the political and public arena. And so right here, you can see the kinda optimism of the early 20 tens and even prior to that, with regard to the color revolutions, and with regard to our spring protest where it was viewed that social media and other communications forms, digital communication forms. We're really responsible for helping to mobilize publics to galvanize people onto the streets the pushback against entrenched autocratic systems. And so There was a lot of optimism about the ability of social media of different information technologies to really mass and change the nature of citizen resistance to authoritarian forms of government. And in fact, there's such an optimism that we the community coined a term, liberation Technology, to celebrate the fact, that, you know, these these technologies were really helping to power and enable a new form of protest, a new means of challenging autocratic rule.

And you can see that a lot of the kind of optimism has sort of moved into a much more pessimistic state that In part, this is reflection of governments learning from and and kind of thinking about new strategies and new techniques to counteract these unprecedented digital movements and define ways in which to harness, manipulate, and exploit these technologies, for surveillance and other coercive purposes. And while China certainly does not represent, the median, in terms of either autocorrect regimes or governments worldwide in terms of what they are doing with technology, as I'll discuss a little later in his presentation, China does represent a model that other countries have emulated as just sort of showcase what is potentially possible when it comes to using digital tools as a means to reassert foothovo control, in in sort of more recent. more recent years. So let's start with just some basics right here. you know, what I wanna What I wanna wanna emphasize is that my argument is is essentially that as citizens have increasingly gone online, for all aspects of their life, whether it's political participation, it's communicating with with friends and peers, whether it's engaging in ecommerce, leaders have sought to harness and control those communications, and we're sort of in the midst of a struggle right now, one that you could argue is is in that government's have the upper hand in in more recent years. So what is digital impression? I define it in the book, and this is the book that I wrote. there's a repression. I define digital oppression, as a use of digital information and communication technologies to surveil"

So this is mostly centered around around state activities or or groups that are affiliated with or sponsored with or have some nexus or connection to state actors. So it it really is focused on that sort of political idea. And so to kinda take it one step further and say, okay. So this this is a broad definition. What exactly are we talking about when it comes to technology is in techniques This taxonomy right here of visual repression, which I developed for the book, tries to break it down into more specific areas. So first is surveillance, and this can be both masterveillance techniques using biometric indicators or other types of public surveillance cameras, It can also be much more targeted, so it can refer to Spyware you know, used to malware, to target particular individuals who represent challenges to the state in terms of accessing their personal communications, personal data and so forth in compromising ways or ways that would exploit their their information. It can also refer to laws and directives that are implemented by governments as a way to authorize governments to access information. Next is censorship. And, you know, again, censorship can take lots of forms. It can be you know, in popular imagination China's great firewall is a good example of putting up you know, a a large barrier in in which to prevent Chinese citizens from accessing outside information. But censorship in in more recent, iterations can be much more nuanced. It can involve excessive content take down requests social media platforms that ends up and they or ends up motivating, incentivizing platforms take down more content than they otherwise would."

But the bottom line idea is that this is meant to allow for greater control of governments when it comes to information into citizens and, again, information flowing from citizens out into the public. 3rd is social manipulation and disinformation. And so this relates to the the idea particularly of government sponsored strategies, intended to manipulate and and change around the information consumed by citizens, particularly around particular political events or election. So a good example of this that I used in a chapter in my book relates to the activities of former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who built up a disinformation network architecture that involved hiring all sorts of different levels of individuals, largely linked to public relations firms as a way to manipulate popular opinion as well as to so doubt and cynicism in society and to harass and intimidate government critics and opposition members. And so this In particular, it relates very strongly to Maria Ressa, a past Nobel Lori who is the founder of an independent media outlet. Rappler is attempted to hold to account deterante, and now the Marcos government it comes to their policies, but who instead has has felt the brunt of Duterte's disinformation campaign when it comes to excessive means of harassment as well as sort of link to cyber liable and other physical persecution strategies. one thing that's, I think, important to mention is that these are not segregated categories. they very much feed into and relate to one another. And so when you when you think about Maria Ressa in a disinformation campaign, that also links up to"

And then finally, there's Internet shutdowns, which it may specs is very closely linked to and a form of of censorship. but I think what is important and distinct about Internet shutdowns is the fact that they our time bound. Oftentimes, they're also bound by geography. And so you know, they can entail regional shutdowns in particular areas. A good example of that occurred in Cashmere in India. in Tigray in Ethiopia, for well over a year, close to 2 years where in those regions, due to unrest slash civil civil war, the Internet was systematically denied and cut off for those citizens. And so when you think about Internet shutdowns, as a deliberate act, and the time act act as one that oftentimes is is limited by geography, that's how I sort of think about you know, the sort of nature of this this tool as one one that's used. So having thought a little bit of having walked through what you know, definitions of visual repression and a taxonomy of it I think what's what's interesting next is to think about what are the trends look like globally. So of the things I think is interesting here is that we know that around the world, since around 2004, democracy, has witnessed backsliding around the world. And so one of the things I did is I aggregated and kinda that looks like, and you can see some slippage over here. What is interesting is I've also and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a second. I've also captured data,"

And what you can see is that Well, Moxie has either stagnated or Baxelid, over the past 20 years, the levels of digital impression implemented by governments around the world whether authoritarian or democratic has increased significantly in that same period. And so I think that just shows that as we've entered the digital age, as we've as as governments have recognized importance of trying to control. digital communications, they have also invested in new capabilities and new policies to control harness, coerce, and manipulate, those very same communications, and this helps to put a finer point on that. that issue. So over here, And just so just to kinda take a step back, I did in the book and what I've kinda updated on a year year yearly basis is put together, what I call a digital impression index. And so The there is an outfit called the digital society project that is linked to the varieties at the project, which most people consider perhaps alongside Freedom House to be one of the sort of most rigorous, statistical data sets available when it comes to measuring different aspects of democracy, The Friday is the Moxie project, and it's agile Digital Society project uses survey data of experts on a that varies by country in order to to essentially measure via their answers and perceptions, different levels of of digital or crash it. And so in that in that you know, they have variables that measure social media surveillance, Internet censorship by country, government and political party disinformation,"

And so what I did is I took all the individual variable data that was there. aggregated it into a single composite indicator and then measured it on a year by year basis. and looked at and then looked at that distribution, in different ways. And so what we can see here is that you know, unsurprisingly. So the countries in red have highest levels of digital fashion around the world is for last year. those in blue have the least the the lowest amounts. And One of the regressions that I ran measured levels of democracy in in its relationship to level the digital oppression. unsurprisingly, there's a very robust relationship between the two in that in in other words, a country's level democracy is a strong predictor of whether it'll actually have high levels of digital pressure. So you can see that among the worst performers in the world, include countries like China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and so forth, countries that also have huge levels of political repression, repression, traditional repression, violence against civil society, restrictions of freedom of expression and so forth. So there's a very strong linkage between the 2, between the digital techniques on the one hand, and low levels of democracy on the other hand. In fact, if you sort of just break it down just to kinda give you a shortcut in terms of looking at which countries rank worse and best, you can see that for 2022, most repressive include North Korea, Turkmenistan, Eritrea, South Sudan, Iran, and China. And likewise, your classic Nordic Northern European countries with the exception of of Portugal stack up as a least digitally repressive around the world. And then if I also broke it down by region. And so you can see that among the worst reasons when it comes to levels of diesel to depression, includes South And Central Asia,"

Sorry. I ran up a linear regression using the variety of democracy's projects, electoral democracy index as it monetary variable. and the digital impression index, which I had established as an outcome variable, variable. And, essentially, what we found is this show this scatterplot here shows very close alignment. between the two variables, essentially, 76% of the variability of the Digital Depression Index is explained by the democracy index that identity. So one of the other questions I wanted to ask was that if you were to break down different factors, that make up aspects that contribute to a democracy, which one of those was much sold strongly linked to digital repression, which one of those is the best predictor whether you'll have visual compression. So in other words, If you deprive private civil liberties. Is what is that linked to digital? So disore pressure. If you have a state that commits an excessive amount of violence. Does that link to digital oppression? What about deprivation of political sub liberties? Or what about civil society repression? So what I did over here is essentially, I put together a put together a model that incorporated these 4 variables, which are individual variables,"

I then I then measured against each one and held constant the others, And what I found was by far the strongest relationship 2 digital oppression. was countries that deprives political civil liberties. So in other words, if a country is systematically reducing freedom of speech. if they are stopping people from gathering in the streets for a peaceful assembly. if they are restricting the ability of media or of political parties from you know, from competing fairly in elections then chances are They're also accompanying those those actions with digital oppression actions as well. And so I think that is an important insight from my perspective because it really tries to hone in on what is the core aspect motivating factor digital repression, And at least according to the data that I've gathered, It's it's it's political. And so Where does that then lead us? Well, I spent a good portion of the book then trying to think about trying to then understand and analyze and using case studies and field research to better hone in and and and interrogate this idea of the political. And so here is some kind of basic findings that I wanna leave with you before we go into q q and a. So on the basis of of of the research, authoritarian government certainly more likely to rely on digital oppression techniques and Democratic governments, But while authoritarian governments were digitally repressed, They do so in distinct ways. So it really varies from the simple to the sophisticated Some countries like China implement vast blocks, and really kind of focus on control techniques, other countries, perhaps lower capacity, like Ethiopia, like Uganda, like Turkey, to some extent, will rely on platform blocks or select Internet shutdowns. in which you accomplish their objectives,"

Democracy is also repressed as well, so they're nonexempt. particularly, if you go one level below liberal democracies and look at hybrid regimes and weaker democracies, places like the Philippines, like India, like Kenya, Hungary, or Brazil, you'll find a variety a variety of techniques that are used. But one of the but one of the kind of more emphasized techniques in democracies over a a autocracy is a use of manipulation techniques versus control. So the use of disinformation and manipulation of public opinion as opposed to controlled techniques like like like like like blanket censorship, or mass surveillance. And I think in part that relates to the political norms and traditions, that operate under semi democracies or partial democracies or weak democracies, versus authoritarian states Now one other aspect I wanna quickly touch upon before I conclude is the question of China. trying to is a is a a question an issue that comes up in terms of its relative influence in terms of spreading out digital oppression around the world, I think there are some aspects to that that are that that makes sense, and there are some other aspects that have that So I do think that China's diffusion of digital technology is shaping data governance and leading to negative policy outcomes Sometimes those actions directly reinforce digital oppression, sometimes those don't. In terms of their most relevant outcomes, it's 1, parallel modeling. So China providing a model for how a state can deploy these techniques to control information. 2, supply and digital infrastructure and platforms, so everything ICT networks, their 5g capabilities, incorporate censorship and surveillance facets. and 3, China attempting to exert a greater influence on multilateral standard setting bodies,"

However, where I think the digital authorities Therativ is a model fall short. when it comes to China. is that 1 Chinese companies aren't the only ones supplying requests of digital tools, autocrats, They face stiff competition from firms based in democracies, from from OECD Countries in Europe. United States as well as Israel. 2nd, that when you think about how digital regression spreads, by looking at China, it's really focusing on supply side dynamics when in fact I would argue that internal political motivations, domestic considerations, are just as important and probably much more important as animating factors for why a regime would choose to acquire techniques and then deploy them as opposed to simply being told by a Chinese authority that this is a good idea, and here are subsidized technology that you can use. And then finally, I I do think that China's motivations for selling these technologies is as much to benefit its its economic interest as it is to advance an overall grand political agenda, when it comes to propagating a far tiredness around the world. And so thinking about how that actually lines up empirically I think is also important. So in conclusion, I think to come up with practical and effective solutions to counter digital oppression, it's important for policymakers and experts to have grounded and accurate under standings about what is driving digital repression on a country basis. it's not just a China problem. is more complicated than democracies versus autocracies. instead, look to regime incentives, and demand signals to understand motivations for acquiring these techniques.

It was on your ultimate slide number 11 when you're really helpfully just aggregating the different factors that sort of lead to or actually, that that that's the reverse that I'm asking. Like, you're you're talking about the different things that indicate strong correlation with digital repression, but I also wonder if the reverse is true. If you know, you take digital repression or in this case, the strong one was political civil liberties, does that also indicate maybe more tendency to exert power that is more damaging. For example, like, physical violence was another one. Right? Like, kind of taking the theory on its head. Does the ability to control information, indicate an interest or a capacity to exact state violence. Yeah. No. It's an interesting question, and I think people kinda look upon it in two ways. So one is that they are mutually reinforcing that One is naturally a complement to another. But a lot of acts a lot of people actually think A lot of research shows that there can be a bit of a substitution effect. So the idea would be that rather that you can you you would need to find a way. A regime needs to find a way to exert control. and that, you know, violence is certainly one option, but it comes with a lot of attendant problems. So there's a a principal agent problem where you're not sure, and we saw this recently provision in Russia, you're not sure that the people you are giving orders to to commit violence will actually follow through carry them out. There's other problems associated with it as well in terms of you know, being beholden to security services as a key to your power as opposed to having being able to kinda diffuse that out.

So I I was just wondering, I don't know if you have an if you have, like, any knowledge or guesses about, like, what's the budget that these regimes invest into a repression. of information. So what was the last part? Do I have any -- What what what's the budget? What's the money that is actually going into there? Do you have any Insights about there, I was just curious. You know, it really varies by different countries. I have some data inhalation to kind of Chinese investments in certain types of surveillance technologies. But mean, the problem is that, one, it can oftentimes mean, it's hard to kinda measure on year in, year out. It obviously is something that is kept fairly closely held for other reasons. I mean, what I can say is that the investments are significant, and you know, the the and and if you sort of break it out by sector, you can start to get more insight. So, for example, I've looked a little bit further into Spyware And I have, you know, kind of information about different contracts that have been tendered they run into the 100100 of 1,000,000 of dollars.

So I would like to challenge your point and your limited patients for the point brought by the first question. So Last year, I made the point that the Internet likely will fall apart based on our introduction of digital sanctions. And that is a relatively value free perspective on that because as you said, for example, many Western companies are supplying the censorship infrastructures. and for a product manager at Juniper, I would assume, it doesn't really matter whether the task is make wares or music, download websites unaccessible. or make something else, which is due to political decision. decided to be made unavailable, unavailable, And if we are looking at what we did with the Internet sanctions as we enabled, policy makers to know, like, you can do that. We can do that. we can make certain things unreachable and what should be unreachable will differ between different countries. In Germany, for example, you will want to make gambling websites unavailable. in Texas. it might be something else. So How can we in that situation really distinguish between the rule of law governing what is censorship and what is not. because making access"

I mean, without getting into a a huge debate about it, I'm certainly not gonna defend you know, some of the the political developments in Texas. But I what what I will say is that that in a democratic system or in a context like Texas, There is an accountable electoral system or you can vote out representatives who are putting forth policies that are illiberal or that were in contrary to to the public interest of society. And, you know, that system has a lot of flaws. it doesn't work. very well. It can be slow, But ultimately, there is a a a number of different accountability mechanisms both the kind of the accountability through courts and through the executive to check some of those measures as well as accountability through voters. If you compare that to authoritarian systems, is no accountability for that. It is ruled by a single by a click, by a regime, or by an individual. And so that, to me, the fundamental difference. even in in a in a weak democracy, there is some ability to vote out you know, a a leader who's putting forth bad policies, but it's hard because elections are rigged. In authoritarian country, there is no option to do that. And so You know, democracies aren't perfect systems for accountability. There are lots of problems when comes to bad policies that are illiberal in nature. but you do have checks and balances within a World War framework that allow for remediation, that would be my answer.

I mean, one of the things I will say there is that there's been a little more exaggeration than reality in terms of how they're implemented. So while there is maybe a future intent to consolidate all sorts of different information streams into assign a single number that would kind of determine whether a citizen would be able to access services or not, whether they're in the good graces CCP or not. In reality, the system remains driven by inefficiencies, by siloed information streams and by bureaucracy. And so it still has yet to reach a a level where the goal of a single number following around an individual and determining whether they can access services or not. is actually a reality. So it's been it's much more fractured in practice. But You know, that being said, just as you see in in Western Countries as well. There are ways in which you know, financial problems can fall around, can prevent one from obtaining certain services, and the more that these this information is fused the more that systems are are become interoperable I think the more this will become a problem.

Or is that -- Or is that Just some countries are picking that up whereas these things are ever present. Yeah. It's a little bit it's it's a good question. I mean, it's a little bit of a tough one to to kinda address for the fact that I mean, what we know is that use of the Internet connectivity and subsequent use of of social media continues to rise every year. So in other words, more citizens and more countries are you know, connecting to Facebook, getting accounts, you know, on Telegram and and WhatsApp and so forth and engaging. And so One question you could ask is whether efforts to control that are more or less constant in a rising just because there are more people that are on or whether you actually are skiing. greater levels of of government engagement in addition to more users who are coming online taking advantage of these services, I mean, my my guess, and and there isn't really hard data out there. This is one of the problems in this field is that it's hard to actually quantify in specific ways year year by year end, year out, actual levels. in terms of how they're increasing.

So, you know, you can actually now scan the whole darn thing. In fact, you can. There's open source software. Anybody can do this. Next slide, please.

I'm going to stuff in the cloud which is behind the another NAT device and all kinds of mapping. And so Internet today is much, much more complicated than those four nodes that we're drawing back in the 1969 70. So next slide, please.

It's all bound together by a core of public IP address is that get stuff places. that's what I wanna talk about in the next slide, please. what we're here today is specifically, can this core fragment? If this core fragments, how would we know it? How would we measure it? And so we can say, oh, Russia put out a press release saying they're gonna control the Internet next week as an experiment, How would we measure that?

And as a result, some people just can't talk to other people. How do we measure that? thing on the bottom right is is Internet outages. So for the last since 2013. I've been scanning the IP for IPV for Internet, to detect outages and and try to estimate reliability. And then, of course, there's all these architectural things like NAT and cloud and stuff like that. how do we reason about these kinds of challenges? So next slide, please. So I have a bunch of technical things that I'm not gonna go into because we don't have enough time but I'm happy to talk with you about them. I'll I'll find where we have a technical paper that will be on the last slide that you can follow-up with, So next slide. what I wanna talk about today is giving a definition of the Internet that lets us judge is the Internet been fragmented, and let you say to the politician, You have fragmented the Internet. or, no, you cannot fragment the Internet. you don't have that power and give you a give a technical reason why. And so if we're gonna define what the Internet is, We gotta start with the prior work. And so if you go back to the surf and con paper, they just said, oh, there's an Internet. gonna use TCP to connect our Internet. didn't even define it. And then Pastel defined it as a collection of networks. that's a little that's an actual definition. Thank you, John.

Maybe you wanna do HTTP queries or something But, basically, can we get an operational measurement of has the Internet fragmented? Next slide, please. So to give a little bit of thought experiment about why this hard. It's useful to think about some corner cases. So one corner case is thinking about laptops. So Lars and I were just sitting over there. We could connect our laptops with a wire, We could be using public IP addresses. He he might have a couple of the I have a couple of those. And we would be using public IP addresses to connect and communicate Are we part of the Internet? just on a wire, right, or on Wi Fi if we're gonna be modern. Right? we can talk about that. We should think about that because that's a legitimate corner case. Because if you scale that up and I scale it up in a bunch of ways here, it's you get to some interesting cases like what if all of China or all of Russia decides to disconnect from the Internet. Are they part of the Internet? So next slide, please. I won't go into detail about the the wireless. So But but it's useful to think about that very small A more common case on the large side is the cloud. Right? There are multiple clouds that have run out of private address space today and even borrowed private address space from block that maybe shouldn't have, and they still run out. Right? There will become a there will be a time when the clouds have more IPV 4 space than the public IPV 4. section.

I already sort of alluded to the country case. Right? what happens and and a very compelling quest question that's come up a couple of times already, what happens if a country leaves the says declares that we are no longer part of the Internet. or what happens in a group of countries? declare that. Or what happens if a group of countries say, You. We don't like you. You're no longer part of the Internet. That was one of the questions that just came up in the last session. Right? We'd like to have a technical reason spelled them from the Internet, Or maybe the answer is You have broken the Internet. There is no Internet anymore. And so I'll give you ways to think about that. Next slide, please. So, ultimately, I wanna give a the definition that answers those kind of corner cases. And at question that lets us take measurements. So I'll I'll hopefully give you a flavor of what this looks like in the brief time that I have. So next slide, I wanna get to the definition. So our definition is the Internet's core is a connected component of active public IP addresses, that can reach 50% of each other And I'm gonna walk through the core parts of this, but I think that definition has a key property that lets us reason about a lot of these things that we talked about. And a couple of things that we try to accomplish in this definition One is it's conceptual, so it's not part of any specific measurement system because no measurement system is perfect. 2 is it's operational, which means we can build a measurement system and approximate it even if we don't get it exactly right, you can say, oh, you did a bad job, but you can do a better I'll do a better job."

So the first key words are greater than 50% And the reason I think that 50% in the connected component is important is 50% makes a majority. There can only be one majority. There can only be 1 more than 50%. And an important property, if if you're an old person, the Internet is that there is one Internet. Okay? And so we try to capture that with this 50%. The other important property is this 50% is a property of the the Internet itself. It's a property of the addresses. It's not because John Pastel said so. It's not because The I Ayanna told us that you're part of the Internet, It just emerges from use of the public address space. So there's no central authority. Next slide, please. So the second key idea is you've gotta be able to reach each other. And in our experimental system, we measure that by Can you ping in both directions? Can you do ICMP probes? And our goal here is to capture the set of universal data delivery, And we do this because this is what allows us to be operationalized This is what allows us to actually measure this. and see when it's violated If you don't like pings, replace it with something else, lots of people have their favorites. the detail is not important. important thing is this is something that we can measure. and not just Imagine. Next slide, please. So the final part is an active public IP space. And the goal here is universal reachability, which was and a long term part of the definition of the engine that we cared about. And that's probably to me, the core thing of the key thing about the Internet Right? Everybody can talk to everybody if they want to.

I'm happy is that I I respect that point of view, coming at this from an engineering point of view And I'm hoping that an engineering definition can help us put a little measurement facts that that are less disputable into the policy discussions, which are also super important. So next slide, please. So a little bit about how we measure this. So I've been scanning the Internet, the ipv4 Internet since 2 1000 2006. And we've been observing outages in the IP before Internet every 11 minutes, 5000000 networks, since 2013. So we have this outages detection system. You can see you can sort of see it's not very good on this slide. in the on the screen. But we have different pretty pictures. You can go to the website there outage.ant.isi.edu, and you can look at your own pretty pictures. And we see things like hurricanes, and we see Time Warner or CenturyLink here, failed for a couple hours, and we saw the war in Ukraine take out parts of the Ukrainian networks. So those are the kind of things that we observe in this measurement system. I wanna use this measurement system to reason about fragmentation. So next slide, please. But Okay. So"

A couple of terms see more useful than outages, and two terms that I wanna introduce to the idea of islands and Peninsula's. So an island is if you're a part of the Internet but you can't reach anybody else. so Lars and I, if we were talking on our laptops by ourselves using public IPs, And we're part of the Internet, but we can't reach it. would be an island. Okay? And disa, for years, had their four slideshates. They were an island because they didn't choose to make them routable to the to the public engineer. On the other hand, the idea of a peninsula is when Two people can talk Two people cannot talk, but they can both talk to a third party. So you can imagine a peninsula where you have to walk to the mainland before you walk out on No. That doesn't quite work. Anyway, where you have to cross water to get to get to some other part of land. Okay? And the Peninsula those are things we see today. We see tier 1 ISPs that refused to peer their customers cannot talk to each other, But, of course, their customers could both talk to USC because we we peer with everybody. Right? And so if you could relay your traffic through USC, they could talk, but but we don't relay traffic because we're not on SP. So that's what we mean by Peninsula. These concepts, I think, help us reason about partial connectivity and fragmentation. So next slide, please. Okay. So islands, as I said, are when a bunch of computers seem to be part of the Internet, but they're not reachable. And they're not reachable, from the core from that 50%. connected component. And we've actually measured this a bunch of times. So this graph on the bottom his since 2017, data taken from ISI, And there have been, like, I don't know. part of the graph has cut off the slide, but there have been, like, 6 or 8 times when ISI was disconnected from the Internet because our routers failed or"

So Peninsula, as I said, are when two locations can only reach each other can both reach a 3rd place but can't reach each other directly? And this is an old old phenomena. Randy Bush talked about it more than 10 years ago, And people have built whole systems to despite this more than 10 years ago again. We see some examples of this today. So there are tier 1 ISPs that declined to pair with each other at least in ipv6, space. And we also see routing misconfigurations and firewalls that could result in So next slide, please. wanna give one example that we observed in our data so we scan the whole Internet, I And we noticed this case where several ASs in Poland We're reachable from one of our observers. but not reachable from 2 other observers. And we have 6 observers scanning the whole or scanning as much of the IP for engineers as we can. And so the one in Los Angeles could reach Poland these specific people involved with the others could not. So we try to understand what happened. So next slide, please. So we actually mapped it out and got trace routes before and after and and did some looking, It's complicated. There are we're multiple up streams for this ISP in Poland, And it turned out because of who peers with whom and who changes traffic with whom 1 of the people retained connectivity when there was an outage in Cogent during this, And the others lost connectivity. Their their traffic was black So this is the kind of thing that happens. This lasted I forget like an hour or something.

So we have 2 algorithms, in our technical paper, which is listed at the bottom here, They're called Teitau and Chaloei that measure outages and penicillers by analyzing our data taken from 6 different sites pinging the IP for Internet. I'm happy we make the data publicly available. I'm happy to share it if you wanna look at I'd love your input on the algorithms if you would like. Next slide, please. Let's see. So the basic idea, I only wanna go into detail one of the algorithms. The, basically, about peninsula detection is basically observe from many places, from physically different places. Our six sites are physically in six locations around the world, If one site can reach it, but other sites can't, you've got a peninsula. So next slide, That's an informal description of the tittle algorithm. So we've applied this for a while. We validated against another measurement system that does trace routes, gives us some more detail, slide base. I'm not gonna go into details on the next slide, but it when we validated it, we get pretty good precision and recall, not perfect. It's, you know, measurement is an imperfect science. I'm you can look into the details in this of the paper, but we did try to quantify we did try to put error bars on Next slide, please. So I want to convey 2 key measurement results. So the first measurement result is if we're measuring the IP for Internet from places, Do we get the same answer? And do we get the same answer when we combine results From one of them, from 2 of them, from all six of them, that sort of question.

So our argument is with 3 or 4 physically distinct sites, you can get a pretty good view of what the Internet looks like. And and that's important because we can't measure from millions of sites. not practical. Next slide, please. So the other put in the middle is peninsulas. How often do Our 6 sites disagree. And the key thing to measure observe here is the scales on the middle and the right graph are exactly the same, And roughly, the number of penicillist we see is equal to the number outages we see. So everybody is worried about Internet outages Is is my route in working? for a long time People don't often think about partial connectivity probably because it doesn't affect everybody. But it happens all the time. And in fact, partial connectivity happens just as much according to this data as outages. And so that's something we need to be thinking about. So next slide, please. We also looked at how long pencil is last, and it's kind of like you might expect. It's sort of bimodal. almost all of them are really short, And the the middle graph is a CDF of Peninsula's with different slightly different definitions. you would expect lots of short pencils because that's what routing does. Right? Routing takes a while converged, And so when routing is not quite converged, you get partial connectivity that we knew 10 years ago from Randy Bush. and other people have published papers on that.

And so one of the things we looked at in terms of fragmentation is can somebody control the Internet? And we heard yesterday from Nick's talk, right, that that the US runs a majority of x where x is many things about the Internet. We looked at address space. Who controls the IP address space. And, therefore, controls the Internet by our definition. And the answer is right now, Nobody. Nobody. no single, RIR, regional registry, or no single country has a majority of IP addresses, and therefore, By our definition, it the Internet is has to be a International Collaboration. However, are a couple of people that are close. And if they got together with their friends, we might have a different answer. So next slide, please.

Can we define that experimentally, think that's an important question that we haven't thought about until recently. I have an answer to that question, which is my the definition I gave greater than 50% of the connected core. and we have some data from an imperfect measurement system to try to give you some numbers for that.

That's a great question. So, basically, you're saying for a variety of reasons, people don't always want to respond to active probes maybe we should consider passive means in this equation. it can I can I say that a little differently? You don't have to give permission to people parties you don't know to observe whether or not you're you rendezvous with some service on the Internet or having a conversation.

So you talked about Rive Atlas, sees that what you are seeing is there. which I don't doubt, but I'm actually interested in do you have any plans to increase your resolution? Because they are certainly saying You do not see as soon as it gets smaller scale. Imagine example, was in one country where you do not have probe. ISP blocking to major parts of the Internet, but not involving your approach and, like, not to localize be basically forming, like, tiny tenant zeroes of networks. So that's a great question. The question was, could we perhaps could write Atlas or or greater numbers of vantage points increase our resolution. So there's a lot packed into that. Our resolution right now is we'll usually look at think about slash 20 fours as the finest granularity. We are very limited in what claims we make about islands because of our measurement methodologies. So we did use RightPAT list. In fact, we use RightPAT to estimate that. to complement because 10,000 is way more than 6. for Peninsula, I think our numbers are pretty good because That depends on do we get the independent paths into the target, and 6 is pretty good.

For those who weren't around, so this was cut back in 2013, in in June, and then there was an IETF meeting shortly afterwards where there was more news coming So Snowden has had, you know, gone on the run from the NSA, had released a whole bunch of ID classified documents to reporters from you know, most I think the Guardian initially and a few other newspapers who kinda carefully curated the the the collection and published stories that were pretty interesting about basically how the the NSA and friends, the 5 highest signals agencies, had been, you know, far more intrusive. There's the scope of their kind of snooping was was worse than people generally had appreciated by our loss. Now I mean, you know, it wasn't it wasn't a lot of the kind of attacks weren't necessarily new technical surprises. kind of the scale of it was, basically. And, again, if you're not familiar with this, or are you forgotten? there's a I think the the Wikipedia has a nice kind of timeline with lots of reminders of all the stuff we saw then.

From from Let's encrypt, but based on Mozilla stats, of, you know, browser page openings using Firefox that are using HTTPS versus HTTP. And, yeah, if you go back to 2013, it was maybe 30% It was the common thing that, you know, there maybe a website would would turn to TLS just to let you enter the password and then go back to HTTP. That was pretty common back then. And that that that has changed significantly. at and not just in the sense of what fir Firefox and website but also because of let's encrypt itself, which basically has helped to get over a lot of the the the problems we had with with getting TLS well deployed at scale. So there's been really, really good progress there, I think. we could kinda ask ourselves why is it kind of flattening at the top? Is there anything we could could do to get from a here, 90% figure to to toward more better closer towards a 100. think that's worth thinking about. Maybe the answer is there's not much you can do at that at that point, but I don't know. We should think about Next slide. There's kinda similar good news in email. And, again, the if you look at email back in 2013, lot of people probably weren't even measuring how much SMTP traffic was over to So this is measuring server to server encryption of email traffic. not using PGP or SMART. It's not this. It's this is just SMTP over TLS. yeah. So, again, it was it was to a large extent, it wasn't really being measured, I think. I'm not sure where they I think stats from going back that far are. But these are stats for essentially what Google see on inbound encryption. of their SNCP over TLS. And, yeah, again, we just kinda see that in this case, the graph went up into the large bumps that that kinda reflects the deployment of mail that there's large mail providers But it was the case earlier on in this kind of whole process that A whole bunch of large email providers would say things like, we couldn't possibly turn on TLS.

But, you know, sometimes starts at 96%, maybe that gap is 200 is kinda not that easily closed. why it's kinda wiggling around might be interested to look Next slide. Serory, I mean so it's but, you know, one of their reactions, obviously, was a 1st and and doing more work on encrypting protocols in the IETF, another kind of part of the reaction was, you know, depending less on fixed long term identifiers. And that's kind of shown up here by looking at MAC address randomization, and this is a paper from a pet symposium a couple years ago. where they're looking at different mac address randomization mechanisms in Android. And, again, you can see the kind of deployment here is kind of driven to some extent by new Android releases and handsets being kind of people buying new handsets and then having new operating systems and so on. and the weird way that those things get updated. But what you can see essentially is that the the you know, there were some microvascularization, kinda getting better. It's the the mechanisms are getting a bit better. getting a bit more commonly deployed, and so that's good. And, again, this is this is just Android.

I guess we might you know, if we want to encrypt DNS traffic, which I think I would argue we we should. because of, you know, it's a lot of data that you're expose metadata that you're exposing to the Internet and really need to. We have protocols for fixing that. we could try and work on getting those better deployed. Next slide. Okay. So then the the the the only other things I have are a couple of a couple of the kind of non historical conclusionary opinionated bits pulled out from each of the essays. totally testing. So I did the selection here. This isn't Bruce's 4 points. This is me. picking out 4 things that I thought were interesting. So one of the things was the one of the student documents was this implant catalog that's was an NSA kind of products that they would, you know, a catalog of products from which their customers could choose, different ways to kinda tap into things and so on. one of the points Bruce makes is he he he thinks that the source of that might not have been stolen. It might have been somebody which is kind of interesting. But, also, it reminds us that Since 10 years ago, when snowed and kind of initially dropped a whole bunch of stuff. There have been other kind of leaks of various kinds from NSA as well. and from other kind of agencies. So The idea that their their stuff is internal secrets are gonna remain secret is presumably you know, demonstrated not to be quite true. Another good point I think Bruce makes is that everything we learned back then is 10 years out or maybe more because the documents were older than new. So we shouldn't be depending on thinking that just thought we we found out then, what they're doing now because I'm sure that's not what they're doing now. They're doing other things. for example, even though we might be encrypting more traffic, perhaps these agencies are just going and buying that that information from brokers who've been collecting it because of advertising purposes. And and, you know, maybe it'd be interesting if we cared a bit about that. other point Bruce makes, and I I make also made it in my section.

And again, despite the kind of outcry and all the all the media not much visibly changed in terms of the US government's approach recorded brews, which I think is a fair point. Next slide. 4 things I said, We we we get pushed back against this. Right? So if you if you turn on encryption for something get pushed back from what I and from my perception, I'm not everybody would agree with this, from kinda 2 classes of of people or 2 classes of arguments. 1 is you're breaking my shit. Stop it. And people do object to that, but then they tend to get over it because they find new ways of doing things. So for example, in the mail case, the people were looked into turn on SNCP over TLS because they thought it would break things. after they turned it on, it didn't break things too much. I remember being at a meeting for ficonized on the ISG. We were at a meeting with a mobile telephone operator who was literally banging the table because At that time, Gmail had turned on that was Gmail, so because the video is 1. videos YouTube. Sorry. Yes. Yeah. I don't use these things. YouTube had turned on and this mobile operator was saying, this is breaking our network. And, of course, it So so that's one kind of classic person that doesn't like us to improve security. Another class is just those people who, for whatever reason, rather we didn't encrypt things. so they can still see them. And Again, maybe some of these people have, you know, good arguments in their in their minds doing it. But I think overall on balance, a I I think it's a losing argument. And we should 2 delay that. bias, I guess I'll take questions at the end if that's okay. Okay. Good. we did produce an RFC 7258, which I kinda have. Right? which basically said that the kind of monitoring that the NSA and co were doing was an attack on the Internet, and we should do our best to kind of mitigate it. And we did we did a lot of work. We improved with TLS 13 and so on and so on."

That is kind of understandable. think it's also true and something we could think And as a result of that, I think regulators are getting more interested in what's going on in terms of regulating privacy and so on. And, you know, so that's the likes of the digital markets act affecting causing the the MeetMe Group to be created. could have done that without regulators having to tell us. So I think the lack of kind of taking action on these things can lead to regulation, which might stymie the kind of permission this innovation that really was the large parts are some part of the foundations of the kind of success of the Internet. And last point, I'd like to let mine I think we should think about the ethics of of what we do a bit more and not just the of engineering and process stuff we always think about. that's kinda largely if you if you if you look at the second bullet, that kinda leads And So next slide? Verzana, again, comes coming from a human rights perspective, good point I think she made. It's hard to it's hard to make do an empirical measurement of A effect. Right? You can measure things like the encryption of ZLS traffic and so on. it's hard to kinda measure the effects that that that Snowden's documents had on the Internet. also, I think, Verdi says, we never considered human rights very much around the IETF, and we probably still despite the good work happening here, we're trying to, you know, move that along. But we you know, there's clearly a long way to go. I think she makes a point. This may be not so much driven by Snowden, but the evolution from who is to Ordup, which I think she considers an improvement from a human rights perspective was very, very slow and probably the evolution was more driven by commercial issues and by regulatory issues, than it was by actually considering human rights.

Steve, basically, you know, his his essay kinda goes way back in time, starts with with with with Julius Caesar or Caesars Cyphers and all that kind of stuff. And, you know, so, basically, he makes the point that governments have long, long, long, long, for long, time and probably always will, not like anybody else using encryption except themselves. Fair enough. But, I mean, I think in this world, I think, as as John's kind of presentation previously said, the Internet is something we all depend on. So that's that kind of approach, I think, doesn't really work. should realize I think Steve says that, you know, spies are gonna spy. no matter if we do better on encryption, they might go and the databases. If we protect the databases, they might attack the the DOM 0 and and the virtualization. If we attack if we can do better there, They might attack the hardware. they might send them the lawyers and basically attack it that way. So they're still gonna try and work around what we do. should do it anyway because if we don't do it, won't have to even work around it. And we tried to maybe able to make things more expensive for some people to just despite at this kind of scale that where you saw the NSA case. again, like, I I think Steve also points out that, you know, even if our IETF protocols were And, were super engrave, which they're yeah. They're not all. Even if that was the case, you know, we have to kinda also consider know, operations, implementations, ransomware attacks, and other kind of things that that might affect And worry more about metadata, which I think is is is a is a good point. Next slide, and I think we're almost the last one. So for clearing so I think I think the whole it was a big deal.

Thank you, Steve. Thank you. I will use chair's prerogative to remind folks on the question or the the the thing that Bruce brought up about leaks is that our last meeting, 116 in Yokohama, we had Michael Lee come, who presented on methodologies for actually processing all of the massive amounts of leaks that are happening so much that it is difficult to even know what people are linking now. There's just so much online available. And so he has come up with some really great sort of automated techniques for going through all of there. you know, all of that trove of information. It's nice. Right. Yeah. So, yes, we wish MaxBank Institute with informatics. I I would like to put a hole in your rosy email world. So on measurement, on a little bit more than 1030 domains. on their sending behavior, we see that there is opportunistic TLS for 92.52% of them, so opportunistic accepting any certificate. falling back to PlaneTechs.

I I I do wonder whether whether with hindsight, this the community paid far too much attention to or or put far too much weight on bad stuff done by governments. partly because of the the predilection of some in the community to not like government. while simultaneously turning a blind eye completely to the bad stuff foot foot foot in some cases, their employers do and continue to do to this day. because if I look up the scale of surveillance, undertaken by some of the social media platforms,"

And is it an unintended consequence some of this the measures have been taken to counter the bad stuff done by government that actually makes it easier to hide some of the activities undertaken under the the surveillance Capitalism banner because it's far harder to spot that happening than it would have been in previous So are we enabling the bad stuff done by this sector to actually continue and arguably get worse. So kind of don't agree. I mean, I think you make some fair points, but I kind of I think overall, I I don't people are reacted to the Snowden documents because of an anti government kind of feeling. I think it was because it was somebody who was caught kind of and break the Internet or snoop on the Internet. If it hadn't been know, a large mega company's documents that have leaked showing the same thing, I think the reaction would have been similar. where I think it is noteworthy is it's much easier to react against let's say, governments because they don't employ most of the people here. And it's harder to actually piss off your employer. have them send you to an expensive hotel for a week. So it's just I think it's just a human nature thing. In terms of the actions we've taken so encrypting more does make you know, it makes it harder to look at traffic because that's the point. It does not make it impossible. So I have a colleague, Doug Lee, who's done some great work on essentially reverse engineering a bunch of the things that mobile phone keyboards do calling home to their the people who who engineer that with a software. and you can find us it it is a little bit more work because you acquire as more technical skill to do it. But the fact that we're encrypting the traffic, even that this gets called home to the the the keyboard maker. is a good thing still. I would argue. Alyssa Cooper."

It's like night and day. Right? Like, it was this you know, very challenging effort to get traction on any of the stuff. and then 2013 happened. And like like like like that the difference in in the interest in the community and the general topic was very palpable. So I don't think it's really the and and many people who worked on the things before and continue to work on them not just in the context of fending against pervasive surveillance. So I just I just don't think that's that's really accurate, and I I think it's a great idea to, you know, continue to try to key off of that to expand the set of projections that we can get for more different kinds of threats. And I think there's a lot of people who are are doing that now. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair. I mean, I I I if I use the phrase blind eye -- No. Andy did.

    "text": "to me that the I mean, the the big challenge of today comparable to what was this one 10 years ago is the centralization thing. And, also, the I mean, what is really different now in my opinion. I mean, 10 years ago, when you because I wasn't here. I mean, it was in the industry, but not attending ATF. But when when the IETF started encrypting everything, we were still mostly in the world in which you had one client and one server, which were run by independent companies, and they were speaking to an opening interoperable protocol. Now we are in a situation in which most cases, especially the average user of the Internet, as a client and the server that are Wheaton and run by the same company in the IOPEC. So they are often not open. You don't even know what they do. And so they encrypt the channel between the two actually a way to cap out even you as a user from checking what what's happening there. So I I think this is changing the the effect of and what I'm saying is that it's not that we shouldn't nothing creeps stuff anymore. But maybe that's the next challenge. Or how do we guarantee some of scrutiny put the end user in a world in which the client and server collude because they are around mostly by the same company and they are proprietaries. Often, they're not open source software. He don't really know what it talk about and which data they exchange. I mean, I think it's it is fair to say that centralization is is a a more pressing matter than it was 10 years ago. I think that's totally fair. I mean, I, you know, I also one of the challenges with dealing that say with the commercial kind of snoops is that a lot of you would have to do doesn't really involve Internet protocols. So doing it here might not be that easy. Just Yep. can probably have more effect by encrypting protocols here. are defining how to do that. than in terms of, you know, whether 2 companies have some side agreement a copy of database fields to each other. not really something the IETF can tackle so well. But, yeah, That's There we are. There we are. Thank you very much, Steven. And to all the authors on that draft, It's really excellent if people sorry. It's not a draft. It's an RBC. Please read it.

So I'm not expecting everyone to have caught up on that list activity. But, Gershvad, if you could just distill for us because I think this may actually just need to be resolved by the working group, the chairs, the IRTF chair, some combination maybe the I guess it's a sort of de facto design team including you all and Ecker. What is the one outstanding Question. Cool. The outstanding issue is on the subsection called content agnosticism in in the document, and to summarize the sort of considerations and guidelines in the document there that if your protocol has elements either in the metadata or, like, in in in plain text available to the network so that they can prioritize or differentiate or discriminate between traffic, then I mean, a, try not to do that. and b, if you are doing it sort of include a technical transparency mechanism, but also try to state in your document how you think it can impact things like net neutrality and stuff. I think Ecker's point is that how how do we differentiate between Good. differentiation versus bad differentiation or prioritization of traffic, I think are 2 examples, but that make meeting that some of the issues are just technical and or just maybe we can just clarify the document more. are ALPN and port numbers, etcetera, they used to"

Anyone else wanna comment on this question? I just want to reiterate and great to see you all. just want to reiterate that we really do not try to set standard for what the ATF should be doing. but we're just providing guidelines on how to write human rights considerations in protocol development. So we're not setting guidelines what the ITS should do. We are that's outside our scope, just providing guidelines for how to write human rights considerations. So that's what we have been trying to do and not changing any way protocols should be written or should work on the Internet. terrific. Perfect my perfect timing, I think. Well done. Yeah. I mean, so, like, look. understand the instinct to say that. like, it's just not true. This document is, like, a number of places says you should do x. and I just managed to get my email out. And, like, right in this section, you could. It says, if there's any prioritization, etcetera, etcetera, the protocol should be transparent. So, like, this document doesn't fase, that you should do certain things. And even if it didn't, like, the like, the reason one writes this consideration sections. is to assistant the analysis and guide the design of the why the secret duration section section exists. That's And if the reasons considered considered yeah. Consideration sections exist. So I just don't think you can say, like, this document is, like, entirely agnostic on what you should do. it just says if you do it, you should, like, write things down.

That's genuinely the response is, like, there may be good reasons it. So I don't know that it is so clear that it's good or bad. In this for specific case. Sure. Well, I think that I think that is true. But I think that in order for this document to write useful guidance, I mean, just don't understand how they're supposed to be used.

And and I and my point is this text does not do that. but but there isn't a right answer. A right answer. Okay. But then that's just not helpful. But that's not the fault of the document.

If I let me just come in on the ALV, an example. I'll, like, as I was clarifying the the text of the section is aimed at prioritization or differentiation, by intermediary nodes in the network and not the ends.

Which one? intermediately. enterprise. and I would too. But APN is used for this purpose.

So I think that just having guidelines for how to write or how to per if human rights considerations is already going to be useful regardless if you can use those guidelines as an actual rule that you can apply as you are writing something else. So I just wanted to say that. Thanks, Jeremy. That's think the spirit in which it's intended. Just a quick comment. So as far as I understand, The comments that were sent to this draft where very, very late don't remember specifically at the time, but they were allowed to be late after there was already consensus about this specific draft in the research group. I think that we allowed that, and that is fair. But we allowed that in the 2 of correctness, if some of the technical definitions were lacking that specific correctness. I think it's great. One of the suggestions that Coleen just made of our trying to find this common consensus between people that come from different backgrounds. at some point, maybe it's good to actually put a deadline to that discussion instead of a spamming or spanning it? Is that weird? Yes. Spanning it for so long, especially because the authors and the community of this research group have already spend the time creating the consensus on this specific document. Yes.
