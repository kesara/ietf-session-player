    "text": "of the things that we looked at is to work with the companies called that produces a products called open EPC I don\u0027t know if you are if you talk with them and basically they came out from the front of our Institute in Germany and they have a fully software core implementation that can skate up in the cloud from a raspberry pi into a cloud deployment fully containerized deployment so something that I would suggest you to convert them they plan to that very open source implementation they have an opportunity mutation where they say it\u0027s very outdated and they yeah this is this is what I remember and they like 3G 4G and the building 5g as well so you might they\u0027re very open to have conversation with people so I encourage you to come to them and I don\u0027t have any business with them so they\u0027re very like 18 engineers and one CEO so so I didn\u0027t realize that they that they were also they had more advanced stuff I looked at the opening PC page of it and I couldn\u0027t get it going and you know the name is a little bit misleading open a PC is not open source implementation they share the source code with their clients but it\u0027s not an open source implementation they have another one that it\u0027s not called open a PC I don\u0027t remember then the name but it\u0027s a little outdated so the open source so that okay but they might do what they do because the open air interface project is essentially that and is it does have a robust community and it\u0027s powered by the urakami guys in France but um we\u0027re not here to play favorites any pcs any PC and if one works better you might come to them and you\u0027d be surprised how much of the project that we\u0027ve been doing over the last year has been peripheral things around that like once you get the EPC up and running the rest is building a billing package but like all these other things that so we can swap this out but you know strong opinions here and so far they\u0027ve been open to you man authentication other than aka so that may also go cool thank you I got a clarifying question so you did Karthik form for phrase up so the project that you\u0027ve got it\u0027s not just for the management and the interface but also for the EPC if that\u0027s yours the EPC is the open air interface project so you didn\u0027t make any changes for for the open air or um we fixed we found a handful of bugs we had to fix and we we upstream those so yes yeah and so the open air interface has a kit lab that\u0027s been a been their github seems to be much more active I lost a couple months this way package installing their own energy and software out of the box that is exactly the goal we\u0027ve been trying to create I\u0027ve been working on manuals of how to set this up like conversely like manuals have here all the things that we can\u0027t just do for "
