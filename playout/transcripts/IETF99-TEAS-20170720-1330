    "text": "from the other projects is not yet available but I will be talking about that a little bit more just a little bit more on the two we\u0027ve published so the first one was what we call TR 355 which is young modules for ftt DP that\u0027s fibre to the distribution point which is like an axis node that\u0027s very close to the home and serves multiple homes it might be mounted on a power pole and what we want to mostly doing there is actually publishing some it\u0027s defining some yang for some physical air interfaces that have been defined in itu-t so these being the physical layers that are used for these this type of device and so we did this depending on the ietf interfaces from and also the eye net and ITF yang types from from from IETF and we\u0027re now working on a new version that sort of adds some more stuff bonding and reverse path EDA means that these devices can actually be powered by the the power supply from the homes that are using them so just to give an idea of what what the scope of that was and then the burger can I go back once mike yeah yeah sorry so this brings up a topic that actually didn\u0027t come up it when you presented this the first time but it follows some discussion on the net pod working group list and it\u0027s good information for this group as well are you aware that IETF interfaces is gonna be revved oh yes okay good it did come up on so I have no memory of stood in agree anything yeah exactly yeah yeah so it\u0027s good for us also for this group to know to be aware that the IETF interfaces is gonna be revved and if you want more information on that look at the net mod list there\u0027s discussion on it but I\u0027ve seen some in several of the contributions this afternoon have had a section on sort of nmda implications right so yeah I just wanted to highlight the one on interface runs it\u0027s so basic and make sure that EDF was aware of it that was really there we are now great thank you we are now and I think the certainly ITF interface is one of is one of the main ones that will impact us the other one which is not currently an RFC is the me entity the ITF Hardware bond which also has that same state separation so absolutely we\u0027ve got to go back and decide our reaction to this but I believe I think our reaction is likely to be similar to that of the working groups within IETF I think no I think quite likely to consider the same guidance that\u0027s being given internally right and at least halfway done this split it just didn\u0027t make yeah but the difference attorney being halfway done and done is that I believe you won\u0027t deprecated the state tree you\u0027ll delete the state tree right the update is halfway done it wasn\u0027t published so if you went and looked in the repo which is publicly available you\u0027ll see it partially done sorry done that\u0027s alright so yeah sorry I thought you were just distinguishing an RFC and an ID though right okay so yes so absolutely yeah we have to definitely consider how to handle this some thing you\u0027ve just Paul you\u0027ve thrown at us um so the other one "

    "text": "we\u0027ve published is I mean I don\u0027t necessarily expect you to be able to read that it\u0027s just to get an idea each of those some boxes there ISM is a module you can see the impulse you can see that the blue is the sort of general areas the general topics you can also see the external dependencies and IETF which this time does include the dependency on when IETF hardware so this is what we call common yang so the idea is that this is it\u0027s sort of roughly equivalent to the sort of thing that might happen in that mod here but goes beyond that a bit it\u0027s some really young that we see being used across multiple of our work areas even if some of it is actually quite I mean like you can see there\u0027s some forwarding modules in there and some and that sort of thing so it\u0027s not all just pure core stuff and we\u0027re working on some new stuff too now and you can I\u0027ve listed some of the things we\u0027re working on I\u0027ll particularly mention the one at the bottom alarm management we definitely have a strong interest in the IETF alarm work which has been moved to C camp but the draft hasn\u0027t yet been updated in sequence so it\u0027s not on the agenda in any way I wouldn\u0027t be able to go to the C camp meeting because it conflicts with the meeting so since it\u0027s an individual contribution we cannot force anyone that over to to submit the draft yes well let\u0027s just hope the buttons before the next meeting if you really want to then draft please reach the others sorry please the I have in fact done that one of them sailing and the other one isn\u0027t here but yeah okay yeah but I\u0027m certainly hopefully before the next meeting yeah and actually if the alarms is something we\u0027re very actively discussing internally I mean we\u0027re definitely want to build our work on top of the so called Valene draft the IETF alarms draft but we haven\u0027t quite decided yet so what it\u0027s done we want to purely augment it versus bringing some proposals back into into ITF okay so how do we do Berger again there\u0027s an opportunity there you can present you can submit an alternate individual draft yes but I think we\u0027d like to work with the authors of this draft just note that it\u0027s not there\u0027s not a working group document there\u0027s no yes okay great we have some ducks to get in the row in a row first though you know because we\u0027re multiple members currently discussing various options we need to get those aligned before we even those individual members as contributors would bring that into ITF I think but yeah no I\u0027d rather I do rise that um the thing to do here is not just say B be effort like this please do it IIF we do absolutely realize that you know that doesn\u0027t work we realize that we or our members have to bring the proposals in we really do understand that okay so how do we publish it we we have our luck and internal software release registry which is just a grand name for a wiki page which does list all our published software which includes both drafts and standard yang and we publish BB F yang into one of our own public github repositories but with draft and standard areas within it but we also have that linked into the sort of de facto standard yang modules area via the singer get sub module which is essentially a pointer "
