So here I am trying to present in leading the gender responsive standards in ISO, IEC, and UNECE. But unfortunately, the meeting schedule doesn't work for her. So here I am trying to present for her to explain why gender matters in standards development And please keep in mind that although today, focus is about gender, there are other marginalized groups that are also systematic disadvantaged, such as visual minorities, Aboriginal people's disability or other identity that can put certain populations under greater risks So three years ago, I saw an IEC conduct a gender survey to the chair of their technical committees and asked, you know, whether they consider agenda in their work? And only 25 of them said yes and in the survey we receive comments like safety issues do not distinguish between men and women so when writing the requirements we don't have to distinguish whether it no a in the survey we receive comments like safety issues do not distinguish between men and women so when writing the requirements we don't have to distinguish whether a man or women shall be protected or comments like committee wars is independent of gender and gender never be part of the committee work. Although, we would like to believe that no product and safety doesn't distinguish based on gender, the reality is that they do do So women are 73% more likely to be severely injured in the car accidents compared to men a couple years ago my colleague Michelle done the research on the association between standardization"

And another Canadian survey, shows that 85% of the Canadian women workers reported at least one issue with the personal protective equipment they use at work. And this just is not include just the health worker, but also include women workers and construction and trade Similar evidence can also be found in the technology sectors So it's being in like what we recognize that technology facilitated gender virus is becoming a growing threat Here, research found that in Canada, more than 55% of the domestic violence shelter are serving women who experience technology facilitation gender-based violence And another 2021 report from United Nations population found also found that at least 35, 38% of the women globally"

And I asked the tool to create a merry couple with the husband, the Asian, and the wife be white, and here is what I got does the wife sing white to you At least not to me. And also I try to no, change the comment and asked the tool to report the white with Canadian or Americans And I keep getting the similar result and it doesn't think that Asian men has a lot of choice So this is just one of the very common example of how AI can be biased in daily life So AI bias, which is also a type of algorithm bias, occurs when the algorithm makes decision that systematically disbandaged certain groups of people because the populations were underrepresented in the data that change the model or because of the social prejudiced were baked into the data itself and these could have disastrous consequences if those bias algorithm were applied in key areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, or credit scoring.

So it's not surprised that the tool is discriminating female So people might ask, if AI or the algorithm is biased because they use biased data, can we fix it with more representative data? Unfortunately, the answer isn't that straightforward and the reality is that this is more than just a glitch Well, a glitch suggests something that is temporary and can be fixed easily Sexism and racism are rooted in our society AI reflects society and our society is biased against women So the chart on the right shows a survey from UN that collect data from countries representing 85% of the worst population and the respondents were asked about multiple biases Know that they won't assessing you know, unconscious bias.

And that's a lot of discussion on developing standards and testing before a company can deploy a system So as I mentioned in the beginning of the presentation, my colleague Michelle is leading the work of gender-responsive standards in the international Standards Committee. And this work starts with the 2016 Gender Decoration from UNECE. So the decoration, acknowledged that women are unrepresented in standardization and then they are not benefiting from standard as well as men And the purpose of the declaration is implementing is to provide a practical framework to help any types of standards development organization to create gender response standards and to achieve gender balance in their standardization process and environment Since its release, 86 organizations have signed at the Declaration as one of the signature, signatory standards Council of Canada has also created our action plans and taking an international leadership role in advancing gender responsive standards So what exactly do we mean by gender responsive standards?"

Both SOIEC, and the UNEC has developed their guidance documents to help standards development organizations to create general responsive standards And these documents were complementary both recommending a similar process And here's what the process looks like So the flow chart in the left shows the steps that we recommended in, you know, inserting gender consideration in the process of standards development. So the idea is to start with the assumption that there could be any gender different, that there could be gender differences in the content of any given standards Then we collect evidence The evidence could show that there is no gender differences there could be gender differences or the result might be in inconclusive, but regardless what the fighting is we argue that these should be documented in the standard documents so that when we come across a standard that doesn't have gender consideration we would know whether this is a the conclusion from a thoughtful process or just no potentially an oversight So we can work through example together If, for example, we want to develop a testing standard on voice recognition technology, then we will stop with the assumption that there are gender differences in this"

Indeed, actually there are the research found that Google's speech recognition is 13% more accurate for men than for women So that explains why my Google home picks up command from my husband better than my And so we found a gender differences in this technology. Then we document this fighting in the standard and also try to address this issues during the process of standard developments so that we can ensure women can enjoy the voice recognition technology as well as men. And this is a generic process that could be applied to any standards. So the idea of gender response standard is not to create separate standard, although there might be tie-end and places for that but what we really want is to make sure that women are taken into consideration in the process of standards development and then women can benefit from the standards as well as men And one of the very important element to ensure that we have sufficient consideration of gender is to make sure that we have women on the table Currently, in Canada, only about 30% of our technical committees are women and similar rates could be filed in ISL and IEC So, this is not surprising given that many of the technical experts came from the stern field where women are traditionally underrepresented. But women's participation does make a difference Research found that more women participated in product development will law to a more gender-responsive products And as Standards Council, we've also done research indicating that our technical committees actually perform better when there are women on the table"

So we are not increasing women's participation for the sake of it but we need to make sure that we can actually benefit from having women on the table. And by bridge, more women on board, we can accelerate the room of change So last year, IASO and IAC repeated that gender survey to their technical committee and this time we see a slight increase now from 25% to three years ago to 37% this time that the technical committee does think gender to some extent relevant to the work of their committees we're making progress but it's still a long way to go. As Standards Council, we've also tried to map our national standards of campus to the 17 SDG goal set by you and one of the goal SDG-5 is about gender equality and currently only 2% of our national standards of Canada contribute to SDG-5 and the remaining 98% is not relevant So we need to do more to advance gender response standards. And last but not least as I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation gender is not the women are not the only group that are systematically disadvantaged similar process and consideration should be applied to other marginalized groups to ensure that everyone could benefit the same from standards So that's all I have to share today Thank you for listening.

So I think like this process is actually applicable to any standards development organization, any process of standards development so what if you're interested, you can check out the UNEC's website or ISO IEC's website on their work on gender responsive standards And I've known that IET, I've also tried to check them demographic of your meeting participants So this is a good start and so we are hoping that more organizations and tech actions to promote gender resources standards and to ensure that, you know, not just women, but other minority group could benefit the same as the rest of the population Thank you.

Please go ahead Thank you for that presentation I guess I wanted to share a reflection sort of tying your presentation to the experience of some of us here at Haiti and then ask a question So I think the, as you probably notice, I don't know if you have attended other IETFs before but maybe just by having a look at who's in the course so you can tell we don't have a great female representation. I would say, yeah women and non-binary participants you know don't make up a significant you know percentage of the people that attend IETF right?

And I'm one where I think, you know, we're trying, you know, hard within this community to, you know, sort of have change On that point, there's been, you know, with this community, this very weak conversations about, for instance the NOMCOM, and I know there's a presentation on that following this one, the nomination committee here at IETF and, you know, whether we need to, you know, sort of work to ensure that, you know, space becomes more diverse from a sort of gender perspective and i think that sometimes in engaging those conversations, there's a bit of resistance, right? And you hear the, you know, the classic arguments like, oh, we need to pick the best of the best, like we shouldn't be discriminating on the basis of gender and that kind of thing. So I think there's a clear need for more researching this area So when we are asking for those changes to process, we can show evidence of yeah perhaps you know other you know areas and ideally you know, research on standards specifically you know, where we show these things matter And that's exactly the question that I had in your about your presentation. So when you spoke about representation, you know, you had some data on product development and how female representation made a difference in that in that front. And I was wondering whether you have any information or data that's specific to SEOs so standards development, and how having more women present makes a difference So yeah, thank you. So I could expect a little bit on that. So this is the research. I have a link attack to to 8 as the research that we've done at standards Council of Canada.

So just one thing I need to clarify that extended council of Canada we don't develop standards. We accredited standards development organizations in Canada So we, though, our recommendations in our action plan is that we actually make gender consideration a mandatory requirement for S SDOs under our accreditation. So they are asked to insert the gender consideration in their process of the standard development.

However, the other thing I wanted to say to you is that when we do that, you will get pushed back because there are parts of this community that think that this is all wrong and there should not be any gender concern in this process and many of the examples you gave are not examples related to intern standards are technological examples related for example to AI training data sets or I mean implement"

And there are some because I think that one of the cases in which this comes up often is whenever we have to set the balance between the confidentiality of communications and the ability to check and stop communications that are not desirable And in gender-based violence, often the confidentiality of communication is used to harass women. And so that's a exactly one of the places where some general consideration should be available in our work. So I think if we focus on specific examples, it will be easier to convince the rest of the community Thank you for your advice data Definitely that's helpful helpful. And so to be honest, this is my first time in the IETF and this doesn't really for under the traditional standardization world where ISO I see it doing, but I think this process is pretty generic that could be applied to an standard development organization and so we were actively the Status Council, were actively leading the gender responsive war at ISO IEC and the UNEC Decoration it's actually not limited to, any of those national standardization body So, I mean, it won't be a bad idea if IETF could consider you know look national standardization body. So, I mean, it won't be a bad idea if IETF could consider, you know, take a look up at the UNEC, gender declaration and to see if you want to become a signatory And I think it would be a nice thing to, to promote in IETF UNEC gender declaration and to see if you want to become a signatory.

The idea is when someone in a professional network achieve a position of power, that person gains some back of knowledge connections informal credits that can be used later to include the entire network professional success And this is something we are really crazy about in economics Now, an example that we usually give is, if you are in an academic, world, and if a quarter of your becomes editor in a journal, this might increase the change of you being accepted in the journal. So being more powerful A problem with that is that it is really hard to estimate the pure effect of power as it typically correlates with the characteristics of the individuals holding it. Let me try to be a bit more clear and let me try to tell you how the IETF comes at help"

So this is going to be like power being in NOMCOM so what we are interested in is looking at whether randomly assigning power 20 an individual in noncom is going to have favorable effects on the network of this individual selected in NOMCOM, and we're going to compare this with the network of similar individuals not selected into noncom And I'm going to be very clear about that in a few minutes So why this is hopefully also interesting for you, because as outcomes, of these individuals, we're going to look at the production of it internet standards and also patents by a subgroup of individuals in the IT So here we're going to talk about I'm going to try to discuss this all agenda with you, and in particular in this story I'm going to talk about which kind of data we use from the IETF organization and the non- non-denominating committee.

So this is what we define as power The other thing that is nice, about that is that you have this super cool random selection into noncom So you have this super cool random generating alchemy that draws members from a pool of volunteers and we're going to leverage this randomness because this is going to be crucial for our empirical analysis Now, what is kind of the empirical strategy here what we're going to do is to look at the productive of co-authors of volunteers that were randomly selected into NOMCOM and this is going to be our treated group we're going to compare them with the product of co-authors of volunteers who were not randomly selected into NOMCOM. OK, so our three our treated group, we're going to compare them with the productivity of co-authors of volunteers who were not randomly selected into NOMCOM. Okay, so our treatment is going to be co-authors of people randomly selected and control is going to be quarters of people that volunteered but were not randomly selected into NOMCOM So what is nice as economies? we are always excited about this random variation is that the only variation is going to come from this random selection and not from the characteristics of the individual that hold this power So let me try to explain you with the graph what we do. So the light blue icons are volunteers in NOMCOM And they have a set of co-authors that are, you know, they're surrounded by their set of quarters. There can be more quarters"

Okay, so this is our round variation. This is how we're going to explore this random variation OK, so which kind of data we use? We have data about the whole ITI grassroots participation. You have we have email listservid, three annual meetings. We have data about internet drafts, requests for comments. This is all public so it's not only we just collected this data The other thing we do is to consider IETF contributors names as inventors in the US utility patents, and I'm going to give you more details about that and we also update about the networks of No NOMCOM volunteers and selected members So today I want to like grab you attention about these two, these last two things the patents and the network of people or volunteers And we are really happy to hear your feedback on how we construct these these measures.

Okay challenge is that we need to match them to real IETF contributors And we might have a problem because in the U USPTO data, we have the inventor name and the ID, but in the IETF data, we only have the name of the inventor or the contributor, right? So in case of popular names, such as, you know, Adam Smith, we might incurring the real of wrongly assigning people to the IETF What do we do? We try to pin down to actual IETF members by putting some filters to the patents So one is, okay, we take these patterns, we look at whether there is at least one pattern in physics, electricity or new tech development or at least one patent, including terms related to the IETF and to internet Okay, so we try to restrict the sample of patents to link them to IETF in a reasonable way. And these are the two filters we're working on. Obviously, happy to hear more your thoughts Now, still, they could be multiple matches of IETF contributors and inventors so what do we do we standardize the number of patents by the number of inventors ID. Let me give you an example. Let's take this little match here adam smith let's say he has a very popular name. So in the USPT patents, there are two Adam Smiths, one is orange the other is brown, one it has 10 patterns the other has 20 patterns. We don't know, we just look at the name, it's just Adam Smith. So what do we do? We're going to sign to this Adam Smith in the IETF, 15 patterns So the average of the patents divided by the number of Adam Smith that pop up into the USPTO. And this is the way the best way we thought of standardizing number of patents when"

What do we do? We want to have an idea of who is caught or volunteers. So we look at IETF contributors who wrote at least one draft one internet draft with a volunteer prior to his or her first volunteering year. Okay, so we take the volunteers, we look at the network, but only before that person volunteered Now obviously, there can be multiple volunteers and multiple non-co- members associated with a contributor So in the end, the person is going to enter the network only through the first co-author volunteers so only we only take the first quarter of volunteer and from that moment on, the IETF, contributor is going to be part of the network This means that in the end, we ended up with an unbalanced panel of about 25,000 co-author year observations, which pin down to around 2,400 items contributors And to give you some descriptive stats, and hopefully they are going to make sense for you, if we look at IETF contributors in the sample, meaning in the network of volunteers, we have about two times individuals So these are the people that are in the network of volunteers They are connected on average to about two volunteers and their connection with up to 24 volunteers. So for a single contributor is up to 24 volunteers"

First of all, the unique volunteers that buy at least one draft are 491 We look at from 2015, sorry, from 2019 They are connected on average to 14 calls co-authors and they can have up to a hundred co-authors now this seems this number seems a little bit odd, so we wanted to check whether that's true, but this is what seems to be happening This is for volunteers Now, in terms of NOMCOM members, the descriptives are relatively similar, so we have a about 115 NOMCOM members that write at least one draft. This is about 15 years. I'm talking here about unique volunteers members. They are connected on average to 15 co-authors and they can have up to 100 co-authors. OK, so here I'm split and I'm only looking at NOMCOM members So hopefully these numbers make sense for you, for those who have experience with NOMCOM Okay, so here I'm splitting and I'm only looking at noncom members. So hopefully these numbers make sense for you, for those who have experience with noncom. Now, one open question, like for you would be, would this definition of network makes sense for you? Is this robust? and in particular we were wondering if someone is a co-author with a volunteer only one or only one version of the draft would you consider that person part of the network? Or is it too? stretch for you to consider part of the network? Should we define a measure of? intensity of co-autorship? So if you only wrote one draft together or a hundred draft, or so on and some forth, should we consider something like that? Or should we only look at? co-authors on the RFCs and not on the internet drafts? So these are like more open questions too, for all of you Now let me finally get to the estimation approach"

What we're interested in is that the effect of the treatment question to measure whether randomly assigning power to a volunteer as some favorable effects in terms of productivity of Internet standards and patents on the volunteer network compare with the network of volunteers not selected And we think that exante the effect is not clear So is it better or worse if a quarter of yours? becomes selected into an outcome? So let's try to look at very, so let me first probably explain with an equation this specific we are looking at for those of you who are in social science and then we can look at the preliminary results that we have. So the regression is relatively straightforward. So the way is the number of early RFCs or patents produced by an IETF contributor J in the net network. This guy is going to be treated whenever, or this girl is going to be treated whenever the co-author get selected into NOMCOM. And we also try to understand whether there is a differential effect if a co-author female gets selected into NOMCOM. So this is gamma-2 is going to measure the differential effect for a female selected into noncom. We are also controlling for the experience of this person in the IETF in terms of age and then some fixed effects, what we define as individual fixed effects and time fixed effects So finally, very simple preliminary results"

We're talking about an elasticity of 45% which is not negligible And this is relatively preliminary, but we wanted to, you know, at least show you some preliminary results so to conclude we exploit a unique case in the same profession namely in the IETF, in which a location to powerful positions is random. And we want to know if this power would be defined as power, improves the productivity of co-otors in terms of integrity standards. And obviously, we have many, many things to do.

And you have some things which are really against privacy in each one of our lives. You know, how many things have we done, how many patents have we filed? It's a difficult thing to research And your methodology reads, exactly on going into what each person is doing and what patents they've written and what's their business relationship as far as the patents It's a hard subject to read research, an important one, but how do you get a methodology?

But thanks Great. Hi colin perkins. Firstly, thank you for doing the study. I thought this was really interesting I thought the idea of using the random selection in the NOMCOM process to de-biased things was really clever I was really, I thought that was a really nice way of doing it I'm not entirely sure I agree with it Rudger's analysis and views on the NOMCOM Certainly, being selected for the NOMECOM clearly gives you power It's perhaps a diffuse and indirect sense of power but it clearly gives you power Am I right in understanding that you looked at the productivity of the co-offers of people's? selected for the NOMCOM, rather than the people selected for the NOMCOM? themselves? Exactly. So we look at the productivity of co-op co-authors, of volunteers, and then the only random variation is going to be whether your court people selected for the NOMCOM themselves. Exactly, so we look at the productivity of co-authors, of volunteers, and then the only random variation is going to be whether your co-author gets selected or not into NOMCOM exactly. Yeah. Okay.

Thanks Hey, this is really cool All the algorithmic fairness research is always fascinating and it's good research is always fascinating and I think it's great to have like diversity of educational experience in the room here and modeling techniques and stuff Yeah, one, I guess my only reaction is that defining productivity is hard and like and sort of culturally contextual the choice here of defining it along one dimension of like patents makes sense to me as like one component but I would kind of, you know that patents are the most productive best metric of productivity. They're really useful for a number of things that aren't like productivity of financial outcomes. So like the Dutch sandwich is something that Pricewaterhouse Cooper invented in the 2010 That was a tax avoidance scheme that was predicated on a lot of patents. So like a lot of tech companies acquired a lot of patents and then didn't have to pay their fair share at the tax bill. So it's pretty Cooper invented in the 2010s. That was a tax avoidance scheme that was predicated on a lot of patents. So a lot of tech companies acquired a lot of patents and then didn't have to pay their fair share of the tax bill. So it's productive from a financial or like profit oriented metric and so it's like I don't know lot of patents and then didn't have to pay their fair share of the tax bill. So it's productive from a financial or like profit oriented metric. And so it's like I don't think it's doesn't belong there at all, but I'd be really interested in asking around what other people consider as productive and making that more of like a multi-dimensional metric because especially how the randomness affects different, like assumptions of what product means would be really illustrative, maybe it doesn't help with some things, maybe it really helps with things that aren't patents that are potentially even more important, like customer happiness or environmental outcomes or you know, one thing in the earlier session of like, specs and standards could make predictions about the impact on gender, really the impact in general, if we get to define productivity as are we learning how to make accurate predictions?"

So if you have a story to share or know someone who does, but a key process in innovation within the IETF reached out or anything else, that you think based on what we shared we'd love to hear from you. This is our contact information And we actually have a research jury. Tim is on it Key, who was in last year's cohort, and Rousa's Zubizar Zubizarretta. Okay Thank you. Thank you She's got a PhD in organization development and we went to her first and said, look, we want to take the path development, and we went to her first and said, look, we want to take the patterns and use them as lens. Do you know anybody who's used this method for doing research before? and she said no but it's a totally legitimate research methodology And she agreed to help advise us the summer so with that we'll take any questions folks have or thoughts Thank you very much. Are there questions? questions? then maybe more of a comment than a question well looking forward to see what is the outcome of your research and maybe well"

It's my first IETF And as Ignatia mentioned, I'm going to talk about activity pub. And this is based on the second chapter of my book, which focuses on Macedon and the Fediverse, which should be out from Oxford in 2025, early 2025 Just by way of background, I did Activity Pub is a W3C recommendation or standard producer by the social web working group. They were active as you can see, 2014 to 2018 and they had in their chart basically three tasks ahead of them one being a JSON-based syntax for some data, so I call that the social syntax"

I guess if we exclude threads and we can talk about threads in a bit but there's also other systems like pixel Fed which is kind of like Instagram or PeerTube, which is kind of like YouTube, and there's blogging platforms that are emerging, dating apps and other applications appearing in this space and just a little bit of background here activity pub is kind of like email and that it treats actors as having imbi appearing in this space and just a little bit of background here activity pub is kind of like email and that it treats actors as having inboxes and out boxes so messages get pushed out or pulled in posted out, and pushed and pulled in that manner As you probably know, Macedon gained a lot of popularity My next slide's not going Sorry, it's my bat. I think I did something silly. Oh, okay Macedon gained a lot of popularity after you almost bought Twitter that was in October 2022, and you see this massive spike of people who either have left Twitter for Massadon or try it out and so on Since then, the reporting is said the monthly active user base is down which I think misses the point that the activity pub Fediverse went through this massive stress test and really came through pretty well all things considered and their user base is much higher than it was prior to Musk's purchase of Twitter So what I'm talking about today, draw"

I also read all of the social web working group meeting minutes Those minutes are considered public in W3C's privacy and confidentiality stand And I'm drawing on my train engaged in software studies and science and technology studies, analysis of activity pub and math Massadon. So self-hosting Massadon, admin administering Massadon, using the software and seeing how it works I'm going to start with a little incident that shows the non-standard nature of activity pub. And it comes from one of the authors, Amy Guy. And as Guy told me in an interview, they were working on a dissertation at the University of that in early 2010s And they were working on the semantic web and they were kind of bored by the topic. So like any good PhD students, myself included they were procrastinating on writing this dissertation and they were clicking around that up web and they were kind of bored by the topic. So like any good PhD student, myself included, they were procrastinating on writing this dissertation. And they were clicking around the W3C website and saw social web working group and said, oh, what's this? It clicked on that and clicked on what happens if I join the group, clicks on joining the group and lo and behold they become a member of this social web working group And this is all kind of accidental because they didn't know at the time, as they told me, that you had to be a member of an organization that was a member of the W3C. Unfortunately, University of Vandenboro was, so a guy was able to join the social web working group kind of through this accidental procurement process So if there's a standard way to do in a standards body, Guy's way really wasn't it although maybe many of you have stories about stumbling into study way to do in a standards body, Guy's way really wasn't it, although maybe many of you have stories about stumbling into standards in the same way. But we're lucky"

And frankly, Diane's presentation earlier, some of the quotes from that replicated that. This is not really about bodies in a room it's about, you know, technical progress that's kind of above and beyond human body in a room. So we talk about standards bodies, but we don't talk about embodied people making standards But if we contrast that view with social and historical studies of standards like that of Andrew Russell or Susan Lee Starr, the essays collected in this book, we see that actually, you know, standards production is very messy, and I'm sure many of you can attest to that. And so that's kind of where I'm placing my work, is looking at the messy, embodied way that activity pub came to be So with that in mind, some of the non-standard aspects of Act Activity Pub, one, no corporate social media weren't involved in the production of activity pub which is quite odd. Social Web Working Group produced seven standards, and I looked at many other W3C standards bodies typically they're going to put out one or two standards activity pub itself which again arguably is the most important standard to come from this group almost did not happen. And even though it did happen, most of the world ignores half of it So let me talk about the first one, which is that this group was small beans, that there were no corporate social media involved in the social web working group"

Twitter was especially courted and Twitter basically just didn't show up so people weren't coming to the social web working group from these corporate entities. And this is not standard if we look at the work of Andrew Russell at all as they know it in their history of digital standards many companies, incumbents, incumbents and startups alike commit resources and people to create standards. Employees take substantial time to attend meetings, draft and review documents lead committees, standards work feeds into corporate strategies for purchasing and manufacturing information processes equipment. Now, the authors of Activity Pub are not affiliated with any corporate social media companies. And outside of some early involvement from a representative from IBM and a representative from Boeing, the social web working group really didn't have major corporate involvement. As one of the activities pub authors put it in an interview of later, Christine Lemmer-Weber said, we were like the only standards group of the W3C that didn't have corporate involvement. None of the big players wanted to do it, which begs the question why In my book, I offer the theory that it has to do with open social. So in 2007, Google convened many Facebook competitors to create the open social foundation as its name implies it was a project similar to what the social web working group would go on to do, create an open standard by which multiple social media sites can interoperate So this has a who's who of late 2000s social media Google, Yahoo, Friendster, six apart Ning, Bebo, High Five and Myspace"

And so, as Amy Guy told me, none of the big players, no one took us seriously, no one saw the social WGs the threat, no one expected it to go anywhere the feeling was it was small beans and it wasn't worth their time Now, this leads to the second non-standard aspect of this, which I call standardize all the things Again, typical W3C bodies produced two recommendations or standards of social web working group produces seven listed here on the left And I think this relates back to lack of corporate involvement. It's a bit of a mixed blessing Without corporate involvement, the members of the group were free to indulge various whims in terms of social media standardization On the other hand, the absence of corporate social media involvement may be had the group be a little less grounded in terms of their outcome And so a way that was put to me by evidence Podromo in my interview with him, most of the social web work group participants were either open source enthusiasts or people coming from an academic or theoretical background. So a lot of it was kind of witchcraft, right? It's the imaginary world we can have rather than how do I get more users onto a corporate social network Looking at the meeting minute, based on my interviews, and based on my interviews, there are three distinct groups really involved in social web working group. Solid, that's a project that was talking about earlier today you know the brainchild of Tim Bernice Lee a very academic approach to standardizing social media practices Indie Web, which is a significant faction"

And then there were people with a background in federated social media So people like Wilkie, who created our status, Christine Lemberton who created media goblins Evan Padromo, who helped create O status So as Guy told me, is you going to imagine with these different groups, it went around and around in circles. No one could agree because everyone was invested in their own option. There were a few places where people would not come compromise. There are always things that nobody would budge on So how does this get resolved? Well eventually the group comes to the conclusion we should standardize all the things, standardize all the approaches And this guy said that basically it blocked us All of a sudden people were in odds with each other. We're helping each other out, navigating the W3C process, consulting each other with technical expertise. The whole dynamic change after that. And as Benk put it to me in an interview, I almost want to say we succeeded too much We produced almost too many standards So non-standard three, I think this is very important for the history of activity pub and Massadon, and that is activity Pub, again arguably the most important standard to emerge from this group, almost didn't happen This was a meme that was shared in the social web working group meeting minutes what if we closed without a recommendation? The Federation protocol kept getting pushed back and again partially that could be due to the fact that it was seen as obvious but we see this again and again in meeting minutes. Stop trying to make Federation happen it's not going to happen we're not going to be able to pull this off for a variety of reasons. However, fortunately for us, Federation had a passionate ally, and that's Christine Lemmer Weber, who put to tremendous amount of energy into creating what would go on to the effort for us, Federation had a passionate ally, and that's Christine Lemmer Weber, who put a tremendous amount of energy into creating what would go on to the activity pub.

It's like, I don't really care about Federation I'm interested in pushing out my content of my friends and Federation is kind of besides a point in that regard So it's optional Time is running out. Things are looking very bleak for Federation protocol, what could possibly rescue it, but mastodon. Now remember that in the lack of corporate social media involvement, anyone who comes along and implements something from this group would be kind of de facto a big player. And Mastodon came along and implemented an early version of activity problem. Macedon was gaining traction and 2017. Is it queer-friendly or Nazi-free? social networking Twitter alternative Massadon took up activity pub because O-Statis, which was the protocol was running on didn't really cut it for queer and marginalized and trans members Massadon could federate with Gnu Social which is another federated system via O status and they had very different visions of privacy and messaging In Mastodon, they tried to implement privacy flags on messages, but Ganyu Social instances would ignore those and face it publicize those private posts and thus put marginalized people in danger. And Christine Lemmer Weber knew this and said to Oijian Rochko and other folks involved Massadon we can solve that with activity pub and message addressing So it's Lember Weber would go on to argue, there's this shared queer and trans history"

So Massadon goes on to implement an early version of AP and in the absence of a major corporate implementation, Massadon was the largest on the block. And this impressed the members of the W3C, who started their own Mastodon server in 2017, Amy Guy told me they helped to set this up But even with all that going on, time was running out for activity pub. So here we get to another non-standard aspect of everything. The social web working group charter was set to end in mid-2017 You might remember from early on, it ended in 20 here we get to another non-standard aspect of everything. The social web working group charter was set to end in mid 2017. You might remember from early on it ended in 2018. Mastodon bought it time. W3C granted extensions to the Social Web Working Group to push things back in early 2020 and give Christine Lemmer Weber and Guy about bought at time, W3C granted extensions to the social web working group to push things back in early 2018 and give Christine Lemmer-Weber and Guy, Evan Podromo, just Jessica Fallon, and Aaron Shepard, time to finalize the stand and push things over the goal line Guy, Evan Podromo, Jessica Fallon, and Aaron Shepard, time to finalize the standard and push things over the goal.

And as an aside, I just want to put this in a context. I just read this fantastic book by Avery Dame Griff, talks about the transgender history of the internet, now trans communities have contributed to internet development over the past 30 years And I would argue that activity pub and mastodon could be another chapter in this story Finally, I'll talk quickly about non-standard four and the fact that half of Activity Pub is ignored An easy source to figure that out is to look at Daris Kazamis of highly opinionated guide to learning about activity pub where Kazami says, look, activity pub is actually two protocols One is a server-to-server protocol and that's the thing that structures, you know, a Mastodon server communicating with a Pixel-Fed server to a Pure Tube server But it's also a client-to-server protocol and that could structure a client connecting to the broader federal"

Nobody really implements the client-to-server part And that's kind of a shame because the social web working group members almost to a person told me the client-to-server parts actually their favorite bit. But again, this is due to Mastodon. While Mastodon saves activity pub, Mastodon also brought its own API to the game, and they didn't adopt the activity pub client to server protocol. They used their own API And that makes sense at the time, and people start to adopt similar APIs for Pixel Fed and PeerTube and so on The danger is, and I mentioned Thread earlier, threads, is that Massanon's no longer the big player on the block. Threads is Threads from Meta is adopting activity pub to federate and there, by de facto, de facto that makes, threads the biggest API development in this space but threads is another chapter all together in my book I'm going to move to my conclusion, and I have three main points that I'm taking away from this. One is that activity problem the Fedaverse have largely been developed outside corporate social media logics It's not just that the activity pub didn't really have corporate social media involvement If we look at the subsequent Fediverse, much of it is what I would call non-cative in its political economy People do donations, they run nonprofits That's a pretty dominant model and it's large refused the political economy of behavior advertising, which is used across the rest of the internet But related to that, Activity Pub development did take a tremendous toll on his creation Amy Guy in their interview with me told me i have PTSD i don't really ever want to get involved in standards ever again Christine Lemberweber is somewhat hesitant to talk about"

And I think that relates to lack of support that people might have felt in ways that may people who have some sort of sponsorship or funding or employment study employment don't feel. And the final thing to note is obviously actually Pub is an open standard. It's currently evolving but its governance is a little unclear. And threads, again, METIS threads is adopting it but reports from folks who are maintaining Activity Club now, they tell me that threads in meta are not really getting involved in the day-to-day discussions about maintaining activity problem. So with that, I'll see me that threads and meta are not really getting involved in the day-to-day discussions about maintaining activity problem. So with that, I'll stop, and happy to take questions. Thank you Thank you very much, Robert, for the very interesting presentation Do we have questions? Maybe when people think about other questions, one question from myself side. So what lessons would you take away in the sense that on the one hand? you would be able to see, I would say, had a positive aspect in that it created a room and space for let's say deviance to create something that they were successfully implemented and working And on the other hand, so how we enable that more? And on the other hand, how we ensure that people are not crossed by the way in which the society is made Yeah, that's a really important question. I don't know what might be generalizable from this case without more study of the same sort of standards production. I hesitate to go off of this one case but I do think that it's important in the history of the Fediverse to look at these non-corporate origins and then non-corporate practices"

I mean, that's very challenging Thank you. Colleen Hi, colin perkins. I would hope we have learned something from all the standards activities during the pandemic about how to run these things without having to have everyone flying around the world although having flown around the world to come to this meeting, I'm not sure we know necessarily have. But we're making progress, I think I think what struck me here, is, even though it's such a different type of stuff, to a lot of work we do in the IETF and the W3C works in such a different way to the AI IETF, the comments about half the standard being ignored and taking years off people's lives I think a number of people would say the exact thing the comments about half the standard being ignored and taking years off people's lives, I think a number of people would say the exact same thing about a number of IETF standards. So it's the parallel are interesting. So yeah. Thanks you. It's a really interesting talk and please follow A IETF and IRF unmastered that yeah and maybe maybe that is a generalizable point is to look at the impacts that standards contributions have on people deleterious or positive and ask how to mitigate the stress and trauma of this sort of activity I'm an academic, first and foremost, and so a lot of this I transfer over to the pressures of publish or perish.

I wonder, yeah of the research we've done here on the culture tell us that maybe there's a common thread about badly behaving cultures across the standards bodies who, I think, let's face it, many of them are very poor sort of reputation externally for the internal cultures so just that one thought and then secondly on the lack of involvement of the established players maybe one of the reasons why I wonder if the real one was perhaps because they liked the network effect and like proprietary and don't like openness because where's the incentive for them in the they're quite like the status quo Yeah, I glossed over that, but absolutely I talk about that at length in the book that we are seeing the Fedaverse is distinct from the establishment players, with the exception, obviously threads, threads is an interesting case that needs to be observed but it's decidedly not the classic Haltz Garden Garden I forget your first point was about the years off of life in it your first point was about the years off of life. And to connect that up with the Fediverse, we're at large too, I also have documented, and this is not going to surprise anybody, tons of burnout from the largely voluntary moderation and admin force of the Fediverse. And this is a big question when you get together with Fediverse admins and moderators is how to sustain and support people who are facing burnout from a very, very difficult job Hi, I think so much for this.

They're standards that make the door and like everything in this room is shaped by standard right? They're core to our world, but civil society has underinvested in paying people to show up and participate And then they like to complain later And I think it would be great to figure out how we use some of your research, some of the history of the impact that standards make, and convince some civil society groups that actually pain people, for example, daniel king Gilmars paid by the ACLU and pay to show up and contributes actively and is a major There should be 30 or 40 people like that here. There isn't And civil society should have contributed to the emotional well-being and financial well-being of people building activity pub because the corporations weren't doing it, but it shaped a world Anyway, so hopefully, we can figure out how to improve the narrative so that there's more sources of money contributing to standards creation humans than just the corporate ones"

And at the time he was saying, who's at IBM? And the thought was, well, the, that is so, social media companies tend to hang out over there with the web We should probably do it over there and maybe we'll get more or something, which kind of looks like they didn't, but it's an understandable motivation. But the other thing I'm want to touch on is how you said, like, most of the group wasn't capital, like, since you mentioned capitalism, let's talk about that I was actually there not as a deviant to use the chair's words sorry sorry for the word that was right trying to express myself rather than um but as for my job so like i was i think i joined sort of halfway through and I worked for a real-time comments section company that made widgets underneath everyone from CNN to Fox News to American Idol.com to the sun in the UK etc And what we were hearing from them is like someone's got a that made widgets underneath everyone from CNN to Fox News to American Idol.com, to the sun in the UK, etc. And what we were hearing from them is like someone's got to save the news from these corporate social media companies Like, we're not going to have any news if no one does anything And so I guess I want to like share those two details and juxtapose this notion of like what we think we should do as when we are in our corporate technologist hats and who we're supposed to talk to to make our like to get promoted versus like yeah to the civic civil society what things we need and and who yeah we're that informs which forums we take things to and who we involve in the process the last thing I want to highlight is last year at teach"
