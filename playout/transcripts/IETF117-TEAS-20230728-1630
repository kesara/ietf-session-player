I had mentioned that the narrow slide services can be realized and mapping, and mapping, and mapping, and mapping, network slice connectivity constructs to the end of the late NRPs. and also give the term terminology on the definition of the NRP, which is a set of dedicated or shared and natural resources. it can be associated with the the filtered topology. an RP can be used to support 1 group of the narrow slide services This can help to improve the network slice scalability. Well, the scalability of the NLP itself is also important. if we want to consider wider is deployment of the narrow slide services in the ITM networks. So this document provides a scalability considerations about an RP both the control plane and the data plane. and also propose some suggestions about the optimization of the optimization mechanism both in the control and the data play. Okay. Next, please. Okay. Here, regarding the control plane, the NRP scalability can have some impact to the distributed control plane in the following aspects can we can consider the impacts to the control protocol, number of the control protocol instance is the number of the protocol sessions. the number of the messages number of the attributes or the information image message and also the number of the computations related to the to be executed by the network node if we can see the the increased number of the NERP is for the distributed control plane. we also consider some concerns about the scalability of the centralized control plane. in terms of the processing burdens."

Okay. That's page. Regarding the data play, we know that we have seen the need of the carriers identification of the therapy in the packet. is currently called NRP dataplexlector. we have different options to encapsulate this information in the packet. And currently, there are mainly 2 options we we are considering. use this document. The first part is we can reuse some existing fields in the data packet to identify the NRPs. such as we can use the different SRCs for different RP or ID addresses, and here's forwarding labels. The pros of this mechanism is there's no need to introduce additional encapsulations to the data package. Well, there's also a set of cons, which is as list here, we may have the scalability issue to the existing functionalities I think it may require some change both in the semantics of the existing fields and the processing behaviors. and they also cause some control control protocol extensions needed support this functionality. With the second option is we can considered to introduce dedicated data ID. It's called NRP ID or some other terms may be used in different documents For example, we can use some that that Katie ID carried in ipv6extension headers."

The pros is is apparently that you can avoid the impacts mentioned in the option option 1, We don't need to entire the existing fields in the semantics, in the functionality, or the control plane extensions. So it kinda has better scalability compared with the option 1. on the calls is you really have you know, we need to face the cost of the new data plane encapsulation And we will also It may also require some control play extensions that may compared to the option 1 maybe less extension needed in this option, but still we need to consider whether some option some controller extensions would be needed. in this option also. Okay. That's based. So in the current draft, we propose some scalability optimization mechanisms in both control plane and the data plane. for the control plane, scalability optimization, Melly, the major principles we can consider to use a shared controlling components for multiple NRPs. such as we can consider the shared vertical instance. shared protocol sessions for multiple NRPs. And we can also when the topology of multiple NRPs are the same. We can also consider to share the topologies specific computation and the information distribution. this can save the control plane. resource and can reduce the message exchange for the NRPs. And the 3rd point is we can user hybrid control mechanism with both the control play, distributed control play, and also the centralized controller mechanism so that we can solve the bottleneck on each of them."

Yeah. Exactly. And that's the pros and cons of this a scalable solution. That's why why we also suggest to document the to notions with existing data plane with means they they may not not be that scalable, but they can me some the requirement of the customer in some of their network scenarios. but it seems that it's not a question of scalability. It's scale question of applicability. So, basically, the path that you are suggesting will make some equipment not capable of supporting network slices. Yeah. That is we just need -- It's not scaling. It's deployment. So you're eliminating -- Mhmm. Yeah. each solution also have their deployment may have that that deployment considerations also as my understanding. because if you had introduced data playing extensions at least also some We always need to consider how to deploy it are operated with legacy devices in the same network. 5.

Well, Some people are concerned about the industry scalability. And, apparently, the existing data plane has some issues in that case. So we can consider both optional And by the which one to to choose for a specific deployment. That is something Maybe we can depends on the operator's choice or we can also have some document about the analysis of some recommendations. So, Greg, your point is taken. I think -- Okay. Thank you. We do have various ways of marking the packet to help select an appropriate NRP, whether we need to recommend one particular approach or multiple approaches.

I think it to the working group as they're looking I mean, everyone is looking to tease to to give the direction. and probably the chairs have a a an approach there. or pieces on to lay down the list. Right? We do have extensions proposed in PC and IDR where you can associate either a t tunnel or a policy within RP, so there are a set of extensions that fall under that category. We have some, like, Greg was pointing out there is proposal in MPLS that talks about carrying an selector using M And A. There are similar approaches for v Six as well in other working groups.

Joel Halpern Erickson thank you for your work on this, and are definitely some interesting questions about identification and data plane and control plane and You're doing quite a good job of trying to bring it together and get us to a point we can make a decision. I wanted to float something some of us have been talking about that is not a fully fleshed idea is why there is no ID that captures it but may be helpful on the control plane side. If you make some assumptions, and this is part of the problem, what assumptions are the right assumption But if you assume the existence of recently competent management plane that can specify where NRPs are supported and how to interpret any identifiers of every kind we need, There may be a way to control to scale the control plane component here rather better than suggested by these slides. namely remove all control plane information. Thanks. 0 is the best scaling point we can get to. So I wanted to just float this in people's heads to think about whether Is there a way to get there Is there a way we could use that and think about what assumptions they think are relevant for that and whether Those assumptions are appropriate or inappropriate. Those of us having conversations will be taking it to the list and just Wanted to float this because did a very good job presenting things. Thank you."

Since Slicing is a is a a network service function, there will always be many ways of achieving it. Some of those will use existing technologies and some of them may propose new solutions.

So, again, the motivation of this draft is that as specified in the another slice framework. Sometimes, a customer might wanted to have an additional level of control over to customize the service path for for network connections in the network slice. And also, in some of the use cases, if I sit from a a customer's perspective, I may want to ask for some sort of resource sharing instead of, you know, putting dedicated resource for each of the network connections basically, in that, I could save my cost. Right? And in that sense, the resources are reserved. at the first step, but they are not activated. And then Based on my needs, I could activate any connection using the resources that I have reserved. any moment, And the the the way we talk about the visual sharing could be between the connections or connectivity constructs that could belong to the same or different network slices."

One way we could do that, we could do is to create on demand reconfiguration of the connect of of the connections that we need network size. but but then that means there will be no guarantee that the resources are always available. when you build a new connection within the same network slice. Right? So in In that way, we are what we are going towards is we could actually make use of a topology. which we call the customized apology to help with those demands. what we what the customized apology could do is to create an a a way to express customize the control. Right? And example, to express a path over that apology is to usual suspect, and then we could have the the topology to express other related to constraints like diversities, or even protection or restoration over a particular particular particular topology if we need to. and then the what did the customized apology actually encode is a resource of reservation request that was sent from the customer to the to the provider. saying that, oh, here is the topology that I need to I need you to to"

But if you wanted to have some additional level of control, you could go beyond that and create a customized topology for that purpose. Next the page. So before we dive a little bit further, there are some always some computing around the the terminologies because they customized apology. we are talking about might reflect different thoughts. Right? So here, within a context of this traft or what we are defining is a customized apology. is is a topology that is specified by the by the customer as an input to the next size provider. And whereas in another terminology, we used to hear about we call cut abstract apology. And here, we want to make a clear is distinguishing that an abstract apology is a kind of topology that it's exposed by a network slice customer to the provider.

If we use a network connection based network slices, we could create a network slice with steady, steady, steady, steady, dedicated connection between each state into the TV station.

As another option, we I could create another slice that let's say start with one connection between the stadium and TV station. and then I reconfigure that depending on my schedule. But the problem with with that is the bandwidth at the time of requesting a connection might not be available for from the provider. So I don't have a guaranteed kind of use of the bandwidth at the at the moment when I need it. Right? So next page.

So we are matching these facilities, and we are integrating them through the transport network group. through the network basically. So we consider interesting to have a joint Apollo scale view of both networking and computing resources available. So it's way that we can define the proper traffic in your needing decisions according to the data that we collect from in a combined manner. Right? So this is somehow similar to the approach that has been following draft in in the graph about service function, our topology but not looking at the service functions, but looking at the rest compute resources. So the ability of those resources as attached in the network, as you can see in the graph. in the in the picture. So the data centers It doesn't their pops or the compute facility pops. could be described either in terms of resource capabilities, say, CPU available or a locatable or memory storage and so. or alternatively they could be described in terms of bundles. typically named quotas or or flavors in by different cloud providers. So there is kind of example here in this table where, basically, the different flavors that define the amount of CPUs, memory, RAM storage, and so on so far. Next, please.

We are the players referring to different cloud managers like Kubernetes, Openstack, and and so so different solutions as as the mean of collecting compute note information. Again, the allocatable CPUs, available memory and this kind of stuff. Also, we are able to deliver a bit more the test referring to the way of handling the bundles or or quotas.

So in general, they are working with with this idea of of quota. Next, please. This is simply for visualizing the changes in the in the model, we, as said, we added the the notion of compute node All what was before about the related hypervisor or the this virtualization mechanism would be now depending on on the compute node entry.

Yep. you have the transport network which is discovered by the the transport controller And then what is there is a something on top that merges the information at the poses that is this merged the apology. How how does it work? that that that will be what we have in mind. So, essentially, the data center we expect have a a data center gateway. So that will be the 1 the the one linking, let's say, What is the compute? capabilities with the transport capabilities so we can follow the let's say, the the the attachment of the compute capabilities via they just send our gateway to the rest of the network. And, yeah, and the way of the purpose of of having this information will be for the the the step of instantiating services and so that we could before taking the decision on where to instantiate the service, to have a clear view what will be that connectivity that we could have between those data centers in terms of traffic engineering. I forget it right that the merge of the information is not done by this super controller, but data center gateway? No. No. It will be that On top controllers. Yes. Okay. Yep. And is it something that you already have in mind? Because I never heard about the super controller putting together data center and transport words.

Well, in in cats, the kind of information, the computer information that you could require, is linked to the service function. So it's the the one being consumed here will be we will be one step b before. which is which is time of instantiating. So we need to to understand the capabilities for instantiated the functions. later on the yeah. So Yep. Yep. Understood. Thanks.

Justin, sir, NVIDIA. Couple of questions here. How dynamic is the data you're going to distribute? Is that current lot of data center or hardware deployed So you mean how dynamic is Yeah. Yeah. Because the lot is dynamic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. availability of resources and so. So this is why probably seems to be more scalable to go in the direction of flavors because it could be something much more in the sense that you can only refer the availability of flavors and not the raw resources. This is something that we need to investigate. how precisely how dynamic could be that information. and how and what would be the the the moment of consuming that information. If it's at the time, of of yet instantiating, you will have a kind of a static picture of the precise moment or if it's something that you need to to continuously monitoring, probably going through the raw resources could be something we present priorities on its liabilities.

It's a little annoying as it yeah. I wouldn't mind. Okay. So I think that I concur with Jeff because what understood that you envision that information will be propagated for from Data Center Gateway. And that seems to be Unclear to me. So it's unclear to me. how it can obtain any information. So information If information, this information is provisioned then why it has to hop for the data center gateway. it probably better to be shared through the management play -- Yes. -- from orchestrator to orchestrator.

That that is a is is a good comment. only to comment the the data center gateway for sure will be the link the the the point link in both worlds, not necessarily the one propagating. It could be, as you said, via the cloud management. Also, we could have propagation from the data center thinking on BGP or things like that. but for sure, it will be the the link. Let's say the topological link between both worlds. but not necessarily the the one disseminating the information. Right. And I I would be interested in discussion of this and looking forward for your updates, but what I would encourage is that information will flow only one way.

Thank you So just to go through the summary, the the work is to improve the capabilities as well as multi point structures. Both the directional bidirectional. It's not we're not removing any current capabilities. So it's not the intention to completely replace something with something else all. So current work RCH 25 focuses on point to point in the direction on the intention is to keep exactly that port in rca 245. it suggests you, so you don't know, to deal with multi point. This is the area we we think we're wanting to improve on. I'll explain how. there are in general, there are many multi points. interaction and bidirectional cases in the environment. and and we've had a lot of experience in other activities where there are models that do support multipoint in a more of a Absolutely, but holistic way, so I wanted to I'm gonna work through what this proposal is on that.

One is Yang and instance representation by compatible. The other one modifies the Yang, but it should result in the same instance representations in JSON or whatever. So the the the yang isn't directly compatible with the the instantiation should be And the intention of this is it covers both multi multi point, you know, directional bidirection and also point to point, indirects on bidirectional. so I'll talk to that. But she can go on to the next slide. please So as I said, there are many cases of of services with and network connectivity's representation that that have the the require a bidirectional even a symmetric representation. the mechanism we have here is able to support symmetricatasymmetric forms And the a lot of the transport technologies result in or have bidirectional protocols that that force a return path even if it isn't the same the same size and so on. There's some handshaking or whatever else is that maybe symmetric use of the of the of the bidirectional solution. And when we look at device management and control models, from other bodies, and I can go right back to tier 1, which used a multi point unify representation. TMF, FMTM, engine m, used a multi point unit by representation. I wanna have TAPI does and a lot of proprietary management solutions internally."

And the the the multiple you need buy. I I usually buy here, by the way, to route to sort of summarize you directional and bidirection. emphasizes the atomic unit of the thing you're trying achieve. So you can imagine that's coming in from a service and you said the service you want to multipointed bidirectional construct and and you know that's what you're looking for and you you don't wanna get a lot of bits back. Essentially, you wanna get that construct back. So that was the orientation of history, essentially. If you go on to the next slide, please please please please please please please please please please please please please Thank you. So the I'm not gonna dig into this. There are some issues with the yang here. It's a first sketch of the initial draft. So there are things we've been talking on this week actually that we wanna improve But what what we've done here is this particular simple, simple addition takes advantage of the the fact that rch245 links essentially have optional points in them. So the source and destination point optional, essentially. You can have no source and no destination in a link. And, of course, it doesn't tend to be such of a link, but but it's the the yang lets you have nothing in it. on that basis, we can add a pointless, an optional pointless to the the structure. that can also have no points in it. And therefore, you can this particular form, you can either use the source and destination as it was used previously or you could use the pointless. There's no control over how this is used the other enhancement in the draft takes the source and destination points out and then augment them back in again"

Does So the yang isn't doesn't look the same, but the results should be the same. This one's simple, obviously. And we've been just on on this particular sort of things we've been looking at the point ID, and we believe we cannot use point ID and just simply use TP and load, identify us to to to make the instance unique. We've looked at roles and we're looking for improvements in that, and we've got directionality on both point hand on the link itself, and I won't explain the ma'am. So Can can you come closer to the Michel a little bit? hear your Oh, sorry. Is it sorry. Is it is that any better or Yeah. I can't I can't get much because I'm nearly eating my car my potentially. So be careful. So the next if you go to the next slide, I'll then I'll then the other wrap up then. So the the structure is the the links represent is a brown single entity here at multiple points on it. one references the TP. This is a this one happens to be a room leaf. configuration to the specification entity below represents the flows, and you can see there's no flow between the two right hand points, but there's flows between all other points. I wanted to represent with that with the current solution, I need to have what's shown on the right, which is a collection of point to point in a directional links to a pseudo mode, and that pseudo mode then needs to have a set of rules that convey the specification might think shown below in the the in the left hand picture. So what we've essentially done is"

So there are other things in 84, but we don't tackle on this drought that we wanna tackle. I'm not gonna go through the in detail, but we're we're obviously gonna work on these determination direction itself with how much would be a directional specification of capability using more of a rules based solution to, I guess, by what what flows are legal, links between networks, And so from one network to another outside, improving navigation, potentially, discuss that in details to whether actually relevant for an interface relationship between roles, general models flow and sublayering layering and gen general8345. which is a little bit ambiguous.
