    "text": "Perkins thank you this I think this was a nice summary of some of the issues on your last slide you say you\u0027re you\u0027re looking for consensus that the document is a balanced expression of views even if it continued to review that it\u0027s not consensus I think a balanced expression of uses is a very good good thing to have in there I think a document which concludes with a view there there is not consensus on is perfectly reasonable thing to do provided it is clear whose view it is could you repeat the line have a horrible time hearing on the acoustics are terrible in these rooms I think a document that concludes review on which there is not consensus is a perfectly reasonable thing provided it is clear whose view it is making right and my only point on that and it\u0027s a good time that\u0027s all is that the group should see that statement and say yes we are fine with that pub with publishing it and that\u0027s what I mean by consensus to publish without needing consensus on content yes and that\u0027s really the differentiation that I\u0027m trying to make yes and I absolutely agree with that I\u0027m just saying you if it is not a consensus product of the of the research group be clear whose view it is expressing thank you that\u0027s good guidance I like guidance okay so that\u0027s it on this one and we\u0027re really running late I\u0027d but but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone in here right after us we\u0027re just messing with people\u0027s lunch so please to the next yep so crush upon it\u0027s up and also just a reminder if you\u0027ve not yet signed the blue sheets you still have time to do that and if you have the blue sheets near you could you just raise them up so others can there\u0027s one and there\u0027s one yes so please go sign this Thanks go ahead Chris man you\u0027re in the same situation hello yes so Neil\u0027s and I editing the guylines document which is basically an update to the guidelines that were already there in RFC 82 80 and last time we just discussed the changes that were made from version two to three and thanks to Joe and happy for reviews which we\u0027ve already addressed and there were some other updates there unfortunately we didn\u0027t find the time to update it before this meeting but a significant update is in the work incoming which includes basically a rework of almost all the language in the draft to be applicable to networking solutions generally and not just protocols in the classic sense and there are some places in the document where there is no explanation appended to guidelines which we\u0027re working on now "

    "text": "and since the last meeting that has been I I think one point of feedback - two points of feedback - the draft one was by Karen who said that the intended document status which is on let\u0027s say ITF documents it it has an impact on how much adoption the draft has or how much impact it would make and this was for learning from DNS operations draft that current child so these three changes are coming up in the next version and this one question perhaps which we can discuss today quickly which was brought up by John Curran in the list that the right to legal remedy is also a human right and what we haven\u0027t discussed in the draft and now is attribution and therefore how protocols can enable attribution and so individuals who have grievances can seek legal remedy and get and I mean attribution would basically help you law enforcement track who created a certain piece of content I assume and obviously this has a conflict with anonymity and privacy which is already discussed extensively in the draft i I didn\u0027t sense consensus on the inclusion of this in at least on the mailing list there was some discussion about negative rights and positive rights that the the state not only has an obligation to not infringe on rights like privacy and freedom of expression but it also has a positive obligation to enable that the right to legal remedy is enable and that is somewhat in favor of including a statement on attribution and like my personal thoughts on this are that if you look at the MLS group for example or the OTR protocol where deniability which is the diametrically opposite to attribution is a legitimate goal that is pursued for anonymity and privacy so if you have any thoughts on this topic on how to address this in the draft and how to include it happy to listen to that otherwise I will let bring the topic up back in the list and yes if you have any other suggestions to the draft as always and if you\u0027re using the guidelines to review documents very happy to incorporate your feedback into this draft thank you grocery bot I just want to support teasing out some of those tensions because that is how that is really accurate in the in the framework of human rights is that sometimes there are conflicts and there are nuanced and "

    "text": "that\u0027s the whole point so I think the document can only be made stronger by identifying where those tensions exist and actually trying to learn a bit more about them in the context of protocol and standards development but I do think the best way forward is just to bring this up in the list and point people to the exact places where you might find some additional tensions yes I would say the problem in but not exactly a problem the way the document is structured is in terms of questions right and while while there is a lot of theory on how human rights would interact and are in conflict with each other in in a questionnaire sort of format it seems like oh if I take this then this is a cross and perhaps we can then include a statement that you know this is just use it as an indication of what you want to achieve rather then yeah well I just think because it\u0027s guidelines right like if you\u0027re doing a similar thing for in a legal policy space you really want to focus on those in a lot of ways because that\u0027s where you can influence people making difficult decisions when it matters so maybe if we have enough of these maybe it\u0027s not just this case but there are a couple of other tensions we can maybe start to collect them in a separate section that is like you know sticky issues or particularly interesting things to pay attention to I actually love to see a draft on this I mean I I am I think it\u0027s a not that we have any time but anyone have a oh you have open questions and okay so yeah so please you know review that draft and especially if you are using it somewhere please please contribute the last topic we\u0027re not gonna get to I\u0027ll take it back to the list it was why do we insist on acting like an IETF group when we don\u0027t have to and and and all I could say is that was the method we decided to use at the beginning it was a notion of gee let\u0027s use a method that we\u0027re all comfortable with and and and let\u0027s see it the same dog food as everyone else around us but more than willing to change if we have a good reason to change I know we don\u0027t have to operate like an IETF working group but that doesn\u0027t mean that we can\u0027t and and and so I\u0027ll stop there because it\u0027s time and they don\u0027t see anybody running frantically for the microphone but I do want to keep carrying it on on the on the list I mean I just had one comment on that while we were talking today is I don\u0027t think all of our drafts are necessarily the same I think that based on our Charter we have some really specific ones that we\u0027re trying super super hard to like a draft Association you can imagine one on "

    "text": "freedom of expression because those are specifically mentioned in our charter where as political I feel like isn\u0027t necessarily like a core one as an example right and maybe is even more like the the way that what the draft is trying to achieve is even better suited for it being an opinion because otherwise it\u0027s it\u0027s everyone\u0027s an opinion and then of it therefore says nothing but so just to think about the nuance of that it\u0027s a case-by-case basis as well no in fact as I said if anybody ever wants to write an article for a journal that is not in the RFC status then we could find a completely different method of working it so anyhow I still see nobody running frantically we are over time thank you very much please be active on the list thank you to Jabbar thank you to note-taker and um talk to you I see one [Music] "
