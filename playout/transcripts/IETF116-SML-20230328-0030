Bring the share slide up. Thanks. So I can get out of this. We don't need it. No. Okay. We've reached the top of the hour. Welcome to the Boss structured email. And get the next line. We all know what day and time it is here. And you are. So I'm barry and I'm Alex alex Mali, and we are chair this boss. This is a non working group forming buff. The idea here is to discuss the the issues that we've come to talk about and see whether the Etf is the right place to do something whether we wanna proceed forward with what what the next steps. Are in in talking about this. Note the note well well, You've seen this many times if you've been to the F, if not is your first time seeing this in its full glory But this tells what your responsibilities are with respect to intellectual property and other things. If you have any questions, there's a list Vc that your lawyers can look at And that you can look at too, but not during this session, please. Let's pay attention. Here. Next."

This will be read is for the San Francisco meeting, But for now, please wear your mask when you're not actively sipping your lovely coffee from the barista. If you are actively speaking up at the microphone, you may at your option remove your mask for that, but then please put it back on. And there is a special version of meat echo First of all, everybody should scan the code or activated from from the agenda. To bring up either the light client or the full client. If you use the full client in the room, please keep your sound off and your microphone muted to avoid nasty consequences. But there's a very handy meeting specific version that you can use to raise your hand and that sort of thing. If you want to get in the mike queue, you need to use that to get in the mike queue so that you are inter with the remote participants appropriately, don't just line up at the microphone. So yes, you have to... That that puts you on the blue sheets and I think that's it. Then and you can you can actually use that client to control your slides If you're presenting, we can also just run your slides for you and you could say next slide, please. So Yes. Do we have anybody willing to take notes for this? Just... We don't need a narrative script. Thank you. Really appreciate it. Just the main things that were discussed and decided and what action items we have. So that's the end of the administrative introduction part and the note well, do we have any...

Before we get into the details of email prior discussion of the topic brought me to the points that it might make sense to have a very short introduction about what semantic web and related concepts are because probably one cannot you know, be sure that everybody is here on the same page. So give me just a few a few minutes or single slide to have a very brief introduction about what that is because basically, that's a foundational topic for what will be following in terms of email. Yeah. So on the left side you see from a technology perspective, there has been the vision of a semantic rep, which tim bonus leaves some couple of years I seeing it singapore since the early two thousands. Two thousand one, probably the famous article scientific American. Which basically lined out a vision of making as wide web, which so far was basically a human consumable medium and a lot of human consumable information. To translate or to complement that by machine readable data and this is in all shortness vision of submitting web. That agents or algorithms on your behalf can also make sense of what's written on websites and can you task for you and so on as even in hindsight from today's perspective that doesn't sound so much science fiction anymore, especially when we see developments in, like, machine interaction and Ai and so on. But I think during that time early on it was very futuristic in many many dimensions. In the years after that, in particular within the W three there were a lot of standards"

It's roughly a general message for description and exchange of graph data where you can basically do simple logical statements in a subject pre object matter, like Barry, is a member of the For beverly but a chair offices both for. Our Buried Lima is currently in Yokohama. And according these is also query language for instance like Called Sparkle. Where you can very to queries on the graph data in order to find out interesting information. So in the nutshell, you can also people which are very deep the topic may excuse me for not being super precise here but for the purpose of this boss. You can think about this as kind of a decent decentralized web based database. Which can be assembled together from data distributed or statements made made by many people and then put into certain formats of for. This audio f data can easily be stored into actual files. So is there a file formats or types for this? For instance, application or Xml or text total, is there is adjacent serial civilization called application Chase and L d, so it's Json based format to capture Audio. And there are also ways of... Yeah, let's say, encoding or ann rd if inline in Html documents. This has been invented for Dot document, annotations and algorithms can basically extract from these Html text. Z document. It's a little bit similar, like somebody might know my performance or something like that. So that's very very similar and in a related products they see.

And obviously, if everybody just would make statements based on your eyes, there would be a big mess. Yeah. So it makes sense to have some certain agreement on certain topics. Sort of in ways of wikipedia for knowledge. And therefore, there is certain share vocabularies or developed various communities that can be very domain specific, like in a certain way doubling coral, which is used for meter annotations in websites, there is also the Are version of that. Or sc or case, which is a shared for vocabulary which is has mainly be developed by search engine vendors like Google Microsoft yahoo who Hope I didn't forget anybody about yeah, very basic core concepts. Like, what is the movie, What is the person what is the restaurant? What are properties of those. And as you can see, it's about seven hundred types and one thousand almost one thousand five hundred properties. And it's in the Meantime used by more than ten million sites. And why is this so? So we get now to the right side. So, basically, at some point, big search engines decided that they need to improve search to a certain extent. You might have noticed for instance in the Google search, sometimes you might get something like structured search snippet. So when you Google for a pizza service, you see the ratings, you see the telephone numbers, the address in in a special, you know, very structural way, I would say, yeah, so it's not typical such snippet, which is just a line of text.

So basically is a search engine vendors in a similar fashion like I did before with established core, you know, head attacks which were sort of a previous to that tele website owners to put annotations into their particular website and use... And if they use Keyboard dot org for that, So search engines say, like, okay, we will we might reuse that data in in cases in these structured search results. So who who wants to look at this for instance, I can recommend you to go maybe to spotify not making advertisement you for anything so as than music engine as well. And in Spotify website if you go to a certain album or song or track, and you look into the Source code, you will basically find a little sq dot Org and this is basically how the search engines know if you search for a certain song, which Url url it's spotify to display and, you know, which just me data. So obviously, this is created an incentive for a lot of people to etsy things to their websites, these allocations because, basically, Of course, it's not directly stated, but search engine provider somehow said, this will improve your ranking probably. It will improves the probability that people click to exactly. There is further usages which Are graduated. So you might also know Facebook open graph or twitter cards. So the first one is basic these basis for the like button. If you're again, on spotify web side and kicks you as a Google like button. Again there a similar text to those text, which are Facebook specific, you can recognize them by the Og tech in the Html meta head and there is three cards So this is the basis you might have seen in twitter.

So everybody running a website was not way that's really a cool feature. Another thing, you might be aware of not wiki data. Obviously, everybody knows the wikipedia. And so we wikipedia actually also contains quite a lot knowledge. Yeah. So if you if you go a little bit back to Tim Vision, if I would have asked you, like, ten years ago or twenty years ago, which pope's we're born italy between, let's say, twelve hundred and eighteen hundreds This would be information perfectly available in the wikipedia in the English wikipedia may many for the language versions of it. But it would have taken you actually quite some minutes to find it out because there are problems that's time frame, I don't know. Maybe some hundred pope even more. And you would have being going to all of these pages of those particular people and would check. Okay, Where was it on and so on and so on. And after some time, you will found out. So what does we data do data basically the attempt also use this kind of structured annotations. In order to in order to leverage or to to make information on knowledge the we wikipedia machine readable. Just very shortly, how does it work? Everybody of you somehow familiar with Wiki knows that if or is a page on Pause second. It might just stay he was born in sixteen hundred. So I'm seeing in Sky back at grab break wrote. Scrap it's experiment record, which is an internal wiki link to another a wiki page. Nice was in wiki.

One of the major inventions of wiki in that sense is basically is that you turn something that is considered an error in Http protocol actually into a feature. But by that, you can even also reference information case in that page. And what basically we data was a systems so we get edit updates. They basically proposed a little bit of a little bit of sc before it. So basically, in terms of just writing square back and rome. It allows you to say born in. And square rome and this bone in is by wiki engine, so you won't see it end user, but it's basically stored into some kind of a database. And so again, you can nicely And so that not all editors also we need to ride that. You might be aware a fancy templates within the wikipedia. So if you go to the page of Rome, or was of Yokohama, you see there is on the right side, a very nice info box. And this info box is a weak wikipedia realized based on circle called templates. So if you now start to add this mock which I just told you into the templates, with a single of a button, you might realize or extract to structured data for hundreds of pages that uses template, Ss or as person and so on and on. Which actually gives you a very nice a very nice set of data extracted of the wikipedia. And this is a wiki data project. So it's it has an open Api. It has certain exports that's json led is. You can very nicely integrated into your applications. So everybody not way Of said, I can really recommend to have a look at it. And but now we get into what this might mean for email. Next like please. And by the way, if there questions all the way. Okay. If I'm too far story, maybe something missing feel free to interrupt me and maybe two. About. Yeah.

So email still even was even if it was considered that for a couple of times is seeing still quite lively. And I guess, but some people if you are probably using it right now hands a room. Every everybody of us is using it... I guess, on a daily basis still. And still even those are stuff like, suit filtering rules and so on. It's basically something yeah, where you basically spend a lot of time as a human parsing that email. And then answering to it. So you could even say email is sort of a personal Api because people write you like, please send these slides please up to slides and so on. And you have to work on that. And Yeah. So the question is how could it probably possible to make at least in some cases information, which is in the email also machine readable, so that probably is your email client or other a downstream tools could basically optional help you in process missing some of such information. And also, if you consider a lot of the email you get nowadays points instance transactional mail so you get flight, you get invoices and so on and so on. This might obviously be quite helpful in order to put that probably into certain... Yeah, other applications associates. I don't know. Yep. So that's basically already the point. I made ten. And If you look at it. So I said email is your personal Api. And yeah, for many people, I think email is sort of a little bit of an old fashioned we considered. But so trying some recent discussion, I think in most of the the net about topic of data sovereignty, like getting data of the big mono vendors more in the hands of users. And if you look at it from a certain perspective email in a way historically or today is actually one of the few and large scale technologies or large deploy technologies, which basically bridges your private"

So, yeah, what could structure mail indeed So is has it been structured actually before? And actually, yes, there is tried some historic examples already. So based on sort of the kind of definition I gave, there are actually historic examples where you can do automated stuff within your email client. So... And many of those here in the room probably have been involved in some small these things. Like, Calendar invites. I a protocol. Yep. So it's nothing else a very specific sc or vocabulary in order to organize meetings. And email has actually implemented that. They do some magic on your behalf. Automatically add stuff into your calendar and so on. So that's actually a very particular instance, or example of a very specific case where something like structured email or email that is machine processed in that sense is successful. There is other examples like message delivery know if occasions in a way or r, which is an example from its reports from spam processing. It's maybe a little bit more technical. And a few of these things that have basically, their own mechanisms own implementations, clients and so on. There is some vendor specific things. So I don't know these those guys of field which have been involved with meeting this for quite a long time, which I think like quite some people if you might remember my. Email server, and they had this also I still have. I think it's still life product. I have a certain language where you can answer with one to an email which says like, okay, somebody subscribed you mailing list Please make sure double opt in...

Here, you need to manually input it. But again, it helps you a little bit, what it helps at least respond of this email. There are similar things that many helped us in ticket systems, I guess, probably also a lot of people aware. There is some domain specific applications also on top of email. A recent example for instance is Cl should of Imf at and. Draft far and and delta as a related problem which should product sorry, which are basically instant messaging systems on top of email protocols. And finally, there is yeah, Honest recently or since since like ten years, there it's more generic approaches. So as I said, so R based specific things are always for very particular domain for very particular use case. And of course, if you wanna have something like, you know, processing your invoices or something like that. Going the whole way, writing our see making email vendors implement is probably not a real realistic scenario. So what some vendors actually started and here we actually get back dot org, you might remember from the previous slide. Is that someone is allowed to put in a similar fashion you do that to websites team talking into emails. Yeah. And I can tell you you probably received those emails from Time to time already. It's just your email client who is not able to parse it right now? Because There is some documentation on it, but it's not really what he's supported, but it's basically something used by very big sender and by by a handful of email why just like Gmail yahoo one and one, as we see later And, yeah, we will give a complete example I think.

Track that back or replace that if it's still there or in which situations it pops up. It I think in in some part Google says it also might pop up in your Google search this structured information I'm I have not verified if all of this is still the case, so sometimes things also changed there because obviously, this is also a choice on the side of the vendor in that case. Next slide, please. Yeah. That's just a more full example of so it's almost the entire snippet. I think you find also examples easily on the web probably that doesn't add too much to what I've said before. I guess hopefully, it's the whole idea at this point is roughly clear forces sample just looking a little bit into the crowd. Yeah. Let's see. Okay. Next slide please. Yeah.

On receiving side. I told you already is a list of providers I think I miss so here, but they use very particular approach, which is using three providers also the sc usage on the other three providers is not super consistent, which obviously makes it a little bit difficult for sender adopt it and to get supported. And there is also some experimental open source tool implementation is katie e k mail, next stop male, and a tool called Kd itinerary, which we will see On next slide. Next slide please. So this is just a very short screenshot of an app called Kd, so it's an open source free software. And it was basically you've written as a... Yeah, not just was really a very usable tool. I can recommend it to you as if you do true story offer like it was the. And this app basically allows you to gather all the data you have been collecting from your travel information like your flight, your your train, your car rental, whatever is involved in your trip. And you can basically feed this into that app by they a browser plug in for instance, and that Came in integration for instance, there is a button at two Eighty itinerary and so it sends into that specific app, which you have installed. And as then you get basically rendered, I hope I can see it a little bit here. This a nice itinerary. You see there is some where's information, which also add to this"

And there for train stations. I think in Germany Switzerland Not hundred percent sure there is an open Api, which basically gives you information about the status of elevators. Which is actually quite a useful information for people needing assistance. And especially people in Germany, you might know that on train stations might be struggle with these kind of things. And yeah. It might be quite helpful. If should do the trip to know about sets. So what katy itinerary basically does based on the structure the information you've have app. It knows very well which train you're on, even trying to guess that if the train on is different from the ticket booked, which is perfectly possible in Germany. And that basically combines us with data from public Api about elevator status and tada reps market elevator is broken. So if you know you on platform seven, you should try to Get a workaround around. I don't know if you can reach number eight probably not yeah. So as an example, I think this gives a small illustration What could actually be used cases is that being able to assist this gets really right. Yeah. So this... Again, to iterate is based on a relatively small fraction of data which is currently around. So not so many sender could be using it the structured either, but if many more sender would be incentivize to use it and if many more clients would allow that to forward it other apps or have cell he was there. This is something things that could be possible. Exactly. Alright. So I already mentioned implicitly some issues with sc rock for right now. But I will sort of iterate them again in a way, I think very first thing and this might not have been obvious what I what I said so far is that's the way the email by Gmail one in one is currently design is basically send it to consumer sync."

Once you've got these emails, it's a dead end. Yeah. I mean, you can work with the data somehow. Or at least currently, it's basically the tools by the vendors themselves the across source tools, which you work with that. Because because there are not so many widely used open source tools around which you could alternatively use because I said as bonus rather experimental. And there is actually no way for you to to that in or to send someone else such a structured message. Yeah. So I couldn't forward braun my trouble eating itinerary real something like said, and he would nicely see that in his first mail account yeah. Although I'm very sure he would like to probably. And... Yeah. So we have an issue of our interoperability here because not just procedures a little bit different also the types of structured data supported it a little bit different There is no automated way of finding out which scheme support is provider. So yes. That's not really fun if you're a sender to do that also the properties might differ which I just play it and so on. I said the onboarding is very complex. So registration process already told as the center requirements and Spf certainly makes sense. However is quite difficult for the normal sender to figure out what goes wrong in some cases, yeah, how to get your set right.

First answer is, I think firmly believe this is an relevant extension to email. And I hope I made made some point here in the past couple of minutes. Which make you follow a little on this. This consists of first. Already useful itself could inform in like a few particular examples and"

It's not core topic of above, but I think it's also worse consideration. Is that this provides a probably reusable mechanism which can be reused another work. So I already told you there is previous Rc like calendar invites, message to delivery marine notifications and so on. All of these basically invented own mechanism of processing in an client. So as an email client vendor and also somebody sending these emails. I need to actually implement a very specific procedure in calendar invites or within in end. I'm not saying you need to rewrite this by now that fines that's working. It's great. But if somebody knew would come up and we will actually have a talk on that also afterwards in terms of Pg key distribution. It might be actually useful in case structured email approach would be standardized by the F to basically reuse that approach also for those very specific use cases because actually, it would makes the life of client vendors easier to implement it probably. And this again, what be mutually beneficial for post the course or structured email as presented before. For those particular extensions. So a concrete complete example for I I in mind for quite a long time is actually something like a vacation node thing. Yeah. So there is vacation no support and. But for the email client, if you receive vacation notice, it's again something you need to manually parse. So is no way currently your email client knows like, What does actually is that person certification know just say me say to... Like how how how long away is that person? Who else should I probably contact in in comparison. So you cutting now easily ride a dedicated cfo far I had saying like, okay, Is this data format.

And probably is likelihood of adoption would be higher. Okay. A third point, and I think also very relevant one is said even though the functionality I sketched so far is I think quite straightforward to understand. So it might even be future use cases in addition to that. So for end users in enabling end users also do things to sensor structured information to other users, which would probably... In the larger scale we fire some additional measures here and also more indirect and dynamic versions of email in part going into direction of what I mentioned already and email or there is a product by Microsoft called actual messages. I won't too much into detail here, but I think these things Are headed inherently related in a certain way but some of these things can only be done in a meaningful way if there is a basis structured. And finally to this point, I also firmly believe that this is probably something things that also could help to make to retain email relevant in today's world. Yeah. So I told you email has been considered that for a couple of times. It's obviously not. It's a not used for actually here by now, but we don't know actually if this is will be happen forever. So maybe email usage will drop. At a certain point because there is send another fancy service, which pops up at a certain time and consumes all the transactional emails from people. And so email usage vanish from some type and I think it's a question if the established infrastructure of emails the open and decentralized nature of how it works. If this isn't worth somehow being preserved, also for a longer time. And if we need probably to a equip email, to actually keep keep track with some of the other tools that are around that are being developed. Okay. And final point, I hope too far over time."

I told you there's this registration process for instance which big providers have so these source tools. I mentioned to use bluntly displace the keyboard dot. The email is right? I'm choose this is a good thing. So they might need guidance on how to determine what to show and when to show. There are issues identified, which may come in later slides depending on how discussion pursue. So some particular concrete examples and this I actually identified from some implementation experience we did in the past and where we talk to two vendors that are using this. I told you that couldn't use it what is uni directional, which I think is a very severe limitation because it's totally can secret idea of how works in a decentralized way between you know, people which can freely interact want each jazz. And Yeah. I think any extension or any closing any of these gaps I think it will still be possible to keep it compatible with the current providers in a way. So it's not necessarily relevant or important if for instance whatever we develop on top is directly supported by the existing vendors, which might not be easy all the time, but I thing it can also be done while keeping it compatible to that. And yeah, successfully concludes this first part. Probably, if they are very quick question I wanna take a pause here that I First, I wanna to clarify that because you've talked about extension to email.

So beyond that comment from me, Are there any clarifying questions anything that does anyone have anything to discuss about the problem statement briefly before we move on to the next section. Ted? Thanks very much for presentation. I guess there are two questions that kinda came up in chat would be so to get your perspective on One was... It seems like a a bunch of this stuff that currently goes on in the world doesn't actually use structured data, but uses some form of free text search and Ml to determine what the actual things are. And while I I I see the advantage to the deter and and this it does seem like As long as that's going on, you're gonna end up with two systems. Right? You're gonna have the free tech search in Ml for anything that's unstructured and anything that structured is gonna be a separate and probably smaller set of for documents. So I'm I'm really wondering how you're envisioning this to work in a world where both exist. Because I think both would continue to exist for a firm of time, post specification. And the second, is when we did this for search a very long time ago with Sw Kemp types etcetera trying to create structured information related to the in internals of web pages. None of that actually took on because people lied. And you know, they would put things in the in the templates that did not actually appear in the web webpage. For this case, if you're gonna have things which are not displayed to the end user, that are are structured data that are for processing and not actually on to an end user. How do you deal with the potential of a sender"

So first question, if I add understood correctly, so how does it relate to Ai machine learning kind of stuff, and it's there actually something that needs we maintain maintaining in parallel if this also comes into place. So I'm I'm not, you know, press but probably on machine learning, but the way I understand that. This is not necessarily a binary decision in a certain way. So if you look... If you look something on in hybrid, Ai models or something like that. I think there's also some discussion in the Ai world. When it comes about explanation of Id arrives certain conclusions. You know, that's a big debate in terms of eb and so on. That actually Ai methods to a certain extent also need to be complemented with Structural data. So my short answer is here. I don't see there is strict contradiction here, but these things can actually complement each other. I don't see a contradiction here. To the second point, which is basically about okay. What is if I send something unknown? In a way, yeah. So if the sender send something, which micro current client also doesn't do. I think you can compare it very easily to what we have already with mind ups and attachments So has this kind of extension mechanism already there. Yeah. So I can can send you with your email trying to support and they'll show to you but I can send you word document but actually the email client just know about or some as file format and so on. So the way it works right now, you click on it. And typically, your email client will ask you our case. This is actually a mind type. I'm not aware of will you... Do you wanna open it with an operating system application something Said. Or do you wanna install something. Yeah. So I think that's quite similar case. So that might also happen in in this case. Yeah. I'm I'm it's not probably necessarily something with for this... So what I was talking about. As well, that... That's actually not parallel. What I was talking about"

It's it's processed automatically, but not reflective of what the of what the end user sees. Okay. Sorry. Thanks for if you... Please keep your response brief. We're running over. Thanks. I will call this project, so that shouldn't be the case. Yeah. So a trusted center probably should not do that because you know, it doesn't make sense. So I think it's probably the middle of trust for which centers to accept that kind of information. Can can I do random comment as well from you know, we'll already have this issue with multi part alternative where You have text, bland and text Html, they don't have to match.

Just one brief remark a question before. I think it's not But but you'd see a screenshot very soon, which sort of contradicts the assumption that this the structure part of the email is not shown to the user. So it's not that that's the actual method that the use sees and then the structure part sort of hidden just for the machine. That's not the case. It's sort of both shown for the user at least what we have envisioned. And so sort of having these two parts each other is sort of counter for the user experience. But maybe we got the next slide, and there's a screenshot which I'll go into and then maybe you see what I mean. I just briefly go into why we got into sc dot org or just as an example of structured data in the first place, which is is a isp p sort of, like, I guess email twenty years ago was very different from today. Today our customers at least it's very much a b two x experience they receive a lot of and they send very few email and most of the emails they received are, like, machine generated. So what the little picture I show here is like, basically a robot writes through emails. And so there's so many emails and then as you touched on that before that I guess the trend is that machines help you sort of process your emails. There's of. Like, sort of to, like, three triage or be like an assistant to help you the many emails you receive. And so we sort of had, like another robot in between the robot that in email and the human reach the. And so we started actually out with machine learning what we wanted to do is sort of help you triage your email sort of said, okay. This is maybe a newsletter or a an order email, or this is, like a social media email, and we wanted to help all these different kinds of emails and sort of like, the jobs to be done are very different"

And then going further into details, for example for order, dropping emails. Saying this is an auto confirmation. And then the next event is like follow up to that telling me something about telling you something about of shipping information for the same order and sort of grouping these two emails together. And this... We did orders with machine learning. Which seem really stupid after a while because there's a robot sending emails. And then so email that sort of made to look like a human can consume is and then the sort of tried to pass that using machine learning. So then we went to sc of dot org as the structured version of that where to computer once the email can tell us what blood gist of the email is? So it can use sc dot org to say, okay, this is an order entity and order id. Is like an attribute, which is just like, defined in a structured way. Which also gives sort of the so when a, like, it gives the sender more control over what we do because machine learning as we all know it's not a hundred percent perfect. And so by giving control to sender to tell us and structured way what this email is about. Really help eliminating this, like, uncertainty of machine learning. And the screenshot here on the white with that tried, which I try to I keep really and it's it's just some german test image. It's sort of show with what we envision as an example of the order image, which is some of these elements are more colorful which are they're not emails they are order groups. They... Behind them, there are a lot of emails, but to order just shows. Okay, You order in some shop. And there's like, the did like on the tags in which step it is if it's just ordered or on its way or already delivered, and it also shows it it was delivered with D."

And so basically, that's the idea what we wanted do with that. It's it's not just about auto emails but one of the examples is. And so I guess, abstract from the like, it's a long email which really owned it tells you your shipment is on its way. And so by using sc dot Org and also it's of combining more than one email by each other, we have the ability to even give updates on shopping emails. So you have the email that's auto confirmation, but then further emails tell you that this thing has been delivered, And so they screenshot on the white house, it's an auto confirmation, but the top shows actually the entire process that has already already been completed, and there's also a link somewhere in there that gives you the ability to jump to other emails that are relating to the same order. But I guess, for the purpose of this one, it's really only important to say having structured email in their structured data in there. Really helps with just not having to go through the length of its machine learning really hard, especially in the long tail of all the email and us. And so what we started to do to actually get more traction and have send us you scheme at at all because not that many send us use it yet, we developed for modules for shop systems that you can actually just install for free. Then then it will add the structured scheme out org information to all transaction emails. Because it's in the stopping. It's in the shop system anyway. Right? It sends steam. And so we have these extensions for ease of adoption for smaller shops. And we were hoping that many shops use it, and then all the other are sort of get, like, fear of missing out."

But not going on the text here, but the most important thing that it shouldn't be client specific or Isp isps Pacific. It should be something that the sender can rely on that it's done by every ideally rendered in a similar fashion by every client. But the first adoption model is actually even knowing that structured data exists and having a big enough incentive to include it. I guess for, like, will search results and stuff and rep pages the incentive that you promise that you will be ranked better if you have structured to data, which is also, I guess part of why people are lagging the structured data. But there needs to be an incentive and the incentive can't be like, these three email provide us out of, like, a hundred in the whole white world. Offered this thing, which is sort of similar for Gmail and four one and one, and maybe a little bit different yahoo. And so the knowledge is one thing, but then also, like sort of unification, documentation testing, that's also combined, like all these questions I listed here. A ascend needs to know which may not provider or Box may clients support sc dot org or structured data and emails, which entities as unsupported. I guess, right now, one in one supports different entities from Google. And so End has out of sort of zero or very low incentive to actually to included it because they don't know what happened and the client. They also need to know what it looks like in the client that should easy way to test that before sort of going live with all your emails. Because again, we mostly talking about b2c image.

And as you saw in my screenshot it's sort of, like, it's a very big highlighting and in a very big like, augmentation of the actual plain email. And so we would only want to give that to legit zen and not to spam emails, which then the user would have more trust it if we displayed sort of our like, augmentation of the email content. And really need to take responsibility which we do with, like, only doing it for t signed emails and... But even beyond that, takes out like allow listing for alexa zen addresses and stuff, which is all just to I've keep the spam out. But again, it also makes it harder of for the sender to adopt. What we do. Yeah. And I think that's it on my content so far.

Have the machine learning approach for send dot org data, and we have given and who send it.

This is Barry Levi I have a one one thing that your shopping example brought up. Is the the original thought of Html and the web was that you would mark up your web page and it would be up to the web client, the the browser or whatever. To lay it out to display to render it. And it very quickly became clear that nobody wants that. The the content creators want to control exactly what it looks like. Why would this be different? Why right now when I shop and I get an email message from the shopping site it's in Html, and it formats exactly the way they wanted to. Why would they wanna do anything different with email in the future? The email would remain untouched and still be play in the same way. It's more about adding another layer of. Extraction or out of like the gist. Just like, I guess you still like your email about qr you booked a flight, but still, you would want to a sort of like, summer in the itinerary. So it's not I guess, we're not changing by the email displayed, they're just adding another layer of sort of like like, a meter layout, like, to to to say these emails belong together or these emails are even dropping emails it's not changing the email just adding. Really saying the thing. Thing. Three times over. Yeah. It's really not So we're still displaying the email, but it's also the user ones Sometimes the user seems to want different things than to december. I guess the sender once to read the entire and new setup, but the user only wants to see your okay coupon code. And so doesn't the sender wants the user to see what the sender wants"

That's true in part, but I guess they the email for this... Even for the sender, the email is only a vehicle to I guess they own... For example for news, they want the sale. So having the user cd entire email should only incentivize the user to by something. But if we sort of if we for example, have like, the coupon code highlighted. And that leads the person to click out faster and go to the shop and and and sell and and and purchase that in the interest of both of them. So And from what we have in part you're right, but from what we have experienced, everything that helps get your email more of like, in the eye of the user and have it be more relevant is also in the interest of the sender. So they are actually very interested and the highlighting or in the... Like, let's just say at least in the having like, having the emails marked up for example, as this is an email that contains Coupon. Or this is an order email which belongs to these other three order. If that's something it is of interest. Okay. I I think we're gonna need to sit down over beer for sometime. Too. Maybe boy. Me.

We already have a very well known use case of web pages not wanting to do basic off because they wanna control the username and password dialogue to put their branding on it.

Do you wanna trust them in the same way we have a button as says show me just for this email. Or continue to show and just for this december you'd have continued to show structured data for this sender. Per user and certainly, the larger box providers would learn that behavior over time.

So it goes beyond this small intervention here to explain how this works, but you can look at and we also have, like a session later his evening a sensitive In this mailing list if you want to know more about it if you can just join there. What we also have is a protocol we call a that the idea is... I mean, you can justify define, for example you should change the public key and inform the peers with which we're interacting that this was done. So that means you send them an automatic message out with the new public key and the location certificate you can also put up more aggressively for example in zero trust environment. So for example Us government is prop to do everything in your trust ways"

Then you can just continue to of keys were distributed and so you can also find that you want to rotate more often than just once a year depending on threat model for example, have just to make it less probable that the attacker can read all past communications. The protocol is always important to have group communications in our system so to have like, managed troops or on managed troops or managed groups would be you have an admin who can remove and add people on groups to chelsea people from just a group and can leave of course, this recruitment that this happens you need, of course to make sure that there's a new group key in that not the old one is being used for...

I my me sure. I just I would say, I feel like these are good problems to solve. It feels mostly dis from what we were talking about before. And I'm not sure if the solution space is the same. Yeah. To be discussed I mean, we think that we are also sending around like some kind of structure males in that sense, but we need we perhaps define what What is part of that? Yeah. There will be a later part of presentation talking about possible items to take. And some of them are kind of overlap, but Yeah. The crypto properties might not be the right place for for this work specifically, but some mechanism might be reusable or not we'll find out I suppose.

What would it makes could you provide some expertise maybe to the trust problem that was mentioned earlier. Looks like you might have solved format might of similar issues or so parts of it at least? Didn't understand it in in full, but just it seem to have established a trusted that secure channels somehow? And then later on, you do the synchronization. So... Maybe there's also So in short, what we do is relation between the trust problems mentioned earlier. Yeah. device discover it shows that have independent key a secret public keypad pairs, of course, the beginning. And with pe kain, of course, start to encrypt to themselves and I mean, what you can do when you have an outside communication partner is that you have like fingerprints you can compare in our case, we show natural language words, which we met.

In the end, you have, like, a verified channel, I mean, with verified public keys. Where you can quite sure that know it's good at you I mean, you can Yeah. You can then exchange the secret keys.

So first of all, I think it's important to understand I can get to us after he saw above. So we saw this it might be a good, you know, complementing thing in a way even market I discuss, of course, is if it's exactly in cisco scope, However, I think it's if if discussing that there are two issues So I think what Put out here, mainly is... I think those issues which generally arise when you have automated emails, like you know, you don't wanna you you wanna have a good user you won't have clients be able to detect to to be auto process and so on. So I think this is a clear similarity, and this is actually our own approaches like this suffer from even calendar invites by today, do yeah because vendors do it very different"

But if structured email or a or based would have been in place already before you start a P, you might have even used that for the actual, you know, data in your emails, which you would send around. And so it might be easier to adopt right extensions for you clients so by members. I think this is two different facets, which will relate to Other. And by the way, something which also relates... I mean, despite synchronizing private keys, we are of course, also interest to be able to synchronize contact and calendar collect data over these secure, trusted channel as soon as you establish it, and that it would also be nice to have a common way to do it even if it's encrypted payload in the end, so we couldn't whatever you want inside it, of course, but still there is like ten ambitions are go beyond like secret keys. To synchronize them. Okay. Thank you. Hans here, gear back for the next section You have quite a lot of slides here. We're gonna give you twenty minutes for this section. So we have enough time for discussion, so please Alright. Don't talk faster just talk more efficiently. Alright. Well, yeah. So I've teased earlier so later part of the of the presentation is not also something we strictly know need to go to slide by slide in in all detail. So maybe as an explanation. So as of now, there is there is not yet an rc so you see that on the on the data trigger page, because also you know, this a very credit stage path.

And the following presentation is basic putting together some of these issues in order to give you more concrete idea in, you know, replacement for a draft you could read in to understand a little bit more into detail, what kind of issues would need to be solved know, with is the Here. So said that, I would probably not go into super detail in each of those cases but I will just very briefly explain them and we might probably for common discussion. Pick out afterwards, the ones which somehow are you know, somebody ring about with someone or something like that. As I pull you my proposal and yeah next slide. So overall, so how would we ideally, or what would be my idea probably to proceed with that after this path. So I think it's a good idea probably one would initially start with a very simple baseline. Yeah. Like, not doing super fancy stuff, but more or less getting a framework, which helps you know, as many actors as possible to to get a start in this area. And zed would probably be around formal finalizing or the approach a little bit extension to the internet message from it, We will come to that a minute and thinking about these issues of trust, which to a certain extent, I think maybe also amongst the most challenging and maybe also among those which haven't been sort about a lot yet. There will also be not so much in the next coming slides. But however, I think within the brain Etfs, there would be solutions that could be found. I think it would be important. I stress it before to retain which is already out there. So there is some Esp, some sender which do already send structured data it was in email. So It think it would be important that this you know, isn't rendered useless by an approach to develop."

Empowering users in addition to really make use of send structured mail topics of discovery, like, you know, it's recipient. I wanna send something to able to digest what I wanna send structured email. Aspects of dynamic mail, there's a lot of topics actually is a go beyond that, but I would render that out of scope for now, but if said is decided to be a well and endeavor here by the crowd, I could easily think that this could be something worthwhile to follow up with later. But it won't be following up right now in the next slide. Next slide, please. Okay. So here's a list of issues, which I wanna go through. So no worries, I I don't wanna talk pictures on each of those issues. I promise. Please also note these issues are sort of preliminary and incomplete, so even that even those M mit suggestions, this is not norma suggestion this is more for illustration. So, yeah, don't take everything to literal. This has not been yet widely discussed. It's more for giving you an idea of, you know, what things might need to be solved also not every point strictly important or needs to be solved. This is also a with probably might or might not do now probably my opinion would be that uses more to judge or get an idea of relevancy of overall problems scope and not of each individual topic, which I'll mentioned in the next couple of minutes. Next slide, please. So first thing is it's a current implementation like it's used by sender and Isps. Structured data attached to the email this is with Takes parts and you can consider this a partial representation of the human readable message. So as"

    "text": "just mentioned, I think there was a question from Barry. There is still z h part of mail which is is displayed besides because one cannot be sure it's a structured annotations give a complete account of what is conveyed in the Html part of the message. However, I think this is a viable use case as well. So there might be cases in which I wanna completely describe. The actual content of the human reader part also from machine a prod version, maybe like, in the case of key exchange for instance. When the user isn't supposed to read anything or it's only supposed to read the machine readable version if if she decides to choose for that. And for this, I think there needs to be a way to distinguish for a client This is like a partial representation like it's say right now. Was this is actually a full representation of content, and this is where we have multi alternative ready. So one suggestion would be to allow also alternative search part, so not just explain, text Html, but also something like text json L or text, rd f Html. I think next slide that should be. Clear. Next thing is about which performance do support. So currently, with existing vendors, it's also not hundred percent clear if actually every vendor supports all of these formats, but for instance, for Gmail, it's clear Say support both in the Html, is the Html email header Jason L. So this is a small snippet you have been seeing before on the screenshot. But they also do support line annotations on the Html email. In two different formats, actually, which means that clients actually actually need to support three different ways of extracting that information, which, of course, a little bit of a burden for implement. Question is what would be a recommendation for a standardized version? Proposal would probably be to"

And if you look at this plaque also use different versions of this generation. So some use json Led some use each micro data. A very reason is that with in these systems, the ways that generate content is just different. And so as the extension points there, wouldn't allow easily one of the other approach. So it just makes things easier for sender. And this is probably the rationale that should be having priority. But of course, open to discussion, it's just for illustrating points. Next slide. Next next thing is about the vocabulary. So currently, vendors like friends instance Gmail, users I think six to eight types, depends on how you count out of those what was it like seven hundred? I think sc dot Rock things. On the other ones, I think gmail gmail says I might probably store it and maybe show it at some time in your Google search. But you won't see them directly typically in your Gmail. For you I'm not sure for one and one, I think Juan said I support basically two or three years. So overall the the use cases are very limited by that. Yeah So even though in dot or for instance, a representation of a music album, I cannot send you a spotify song. Even though there is concept and rock location. I cannot send you a location currently. To your gmail account or something like that. So the question is should is stick to skip dot org. Which also in a way would be it would be helpful of course to have some, you know, baseline here, but also, I believe there probably a mechanism to allow for generic. Rd there is any question of course again, like how we'll send us receivers agree, very a complicated question very long discussion."

So the way it is currently, if you look at plain message which you received from Sender which includes structured data. It basically doesn't tell you which part of some semester this structured data applies two. So that message could have multiple attachments for instance. There could be multiple parts in the Html content and basically, there is no way for you as a user for the email client to say, okay, this is where the flight is for instance? The only exception is if you use this inline Html annotations, Then, of course, the annotations are exactly that Management element. And so you have an idea probably as a client where once this is, because the annotations is right into a place. And the advantage would of course be Sorry. That in that case, you could do maybe some inland highlighting or some like that. Yeah. So I have some ui features there in a way. And also, of course, it would be interesting probably to say, okay, this is actually flight which was extracted or which describes what this in that Pdf or something like zed here attached. Something not currently possible. So there are various options I how something like this could be achieved. Just very short mentioning them So obviously, you could do something like multi related nesting, so you could allow for each and every attack to have a multi part related part a rep attachment with dedicated Json File might get a right quite complicated mime three and might be quite complicated for clients. You could think about something like Cid Mid we already have in Rf for referencing message body parts or con Ids in a, similar fashion don't want go into detail.

Some of the issues you come across here restricted email actually issues that have been around already for us things like encryption keys, like calendar invites like inline images. And which I would say is there is certain gap current implementations which this again highlights in a way. And so this could also be a chance to reconcile some of the client behavior or to, you know, more clearly define it in those particular cases. Next slide, please. Sorry very. Okay. Another thing Hai mentioned, do we deal actually with multiple user agents or clients? My personal opinion, and I would be very interested to learn if there is as opinions as a crowd. Is that in the design, while I a was designed actually for movie clients usage in a way. Many of the emails send don't really address or take care of the facts that uses might come into with various clients. So if you think again about calendar invites, there's is a plethora of actual implementations where So service side of the incoming system will already press process calendar invite for the build in Calendar you as a user might actually want to process a Invite with your favorite on a client. And it's very dependent on the environment you use and on the situation"

So in case your own clients another way of each other, a typical provider will twelve imax threats experience wise to use. So we have many users which multiple devices attached to their email provider and with some devices then occasionally, they just get error messages and they have no idea why because, obviously, all the clients are basically...

So again, I think this is a very general aerospace there might be ideas of solving that here probably assignment flex or header of fields to discussion later on? Next, please. Message updates. So currently, when you send... When I essential you flight itinerary and this is process for is this katie each app, and your flight get canceled or something Like said. Unless you do something like an implementation with the airline to fetch life data. There will be no way to revoke that data So even if I send another structured email with a very same flight with a different boarding time or something like that. You cannot currently state that this actually overwrite the prior message. Formally. I mean, you could implement it in a way by whatever comparing flight numbers or some Like said, and assuming this is actually updating, but this would be a hack way of doing it right now. So once you start processing emails automatically, you might want to have a way to explicitly say is this piece of structure data sent by now is actually an update of structured data I sent before or it's even trying to delete that because for whatever fly"

Was changed the issue was changed. Might be something reading in your client, but help you orders it out a little bit. But it might also be nice. Totally irrespective the structured email. If there would be a ahead of field or something like that, that say okay. This stuff update of github actually replaces all the ones before. Regarding this issue, so probably the email time can fold all these emails into one single email. Maybe the loads of a prior ones but get rid of you of the status email flooding.

So one thing I didn't mention yet, is Gi dot org for email actually has one tiny back channel already and since this basic and actually post to confirm certain actions. So as a airline provider for instance, you can actually in your markup which you send to your Isp, include a concept which called confirm action with an Http Url. And isp isps might provides was a small tiny button Excuse me.

So those of few who have been implementing user side, email processing, stuff, maybe also partially Service side, no it's quite the resource consuming to process large email.

Problem is now with structured data, especially if it's if it's embedded in the text Part, you don't know if there's structured data inside unless you really look into that email. Yeah So question is in all for implementation. Might, it'd be interesting to actually add a header a field or something like signaling...

So I think there this was discussed mailing this, I think this has not been done as an rc, but I was too lazy to look it up.

From this legacy databases, I basically display it it's select, So structured data, which one and one for instance has been extracted by machine learning from emails. Will us not be available currently if you access is with an open client like Thunderbird. So wouldn't it be nice also to hammer away, of accessing z data or giving that data which was once extracted two other clients, than just the prop proprietary clients of the Isp.

Was there some particular points People would like to discuss or have questions to I help. I was not too fast but I hope I I got you an idea what kind of challenges are there and you know, I also hope it was sort of clear why I think some of these changes at least would be helpful to be solve, not just structured, but we have been obviously seems that some of these overlap actually was very different use cases.

So the obvious process question would be if this becomes a working group forming know, type of scenario in the future, how do we write a charter. That's a little more limited in scope than everything you just presented. Right? Or you know, I assume that not all of these problems need to be handled at once. With respect to actually standardizing something. So, you know, this isn't so much a question is you know, this is something that I think we'd have think about it just still your slides into know what step one step two in step three for a working group to charter a couple of times. I think we would definitely need to prioritize if we did that. Even though if I'm a lot of short comment, those I mean, I I would even say some of these issues, but maybe tiny.

We need to do inter interrupt testing we wanna convince people that the work that we're doing is functional. Do you know of anybody who has, like, a fleet of male user agents that we can just jam messages at and see what they do with them. And how we could evaluate them as to whether or not they support it That's a very good question. If I catch you correctly, please stay a little bit at some mic to clarify if I get a getting wrong. So the question is if I got it right, how to test this. Yeah. So how can we ensure actually some we develop will really work out how can... Okay We see it somehow? And this is actually a problem right now. So I told you for sender, it's really difficult to test with the current Isps and also told that to see what happens. There are some cases. It's it's not verified, but I heard that know, some vendors might only show certain markup in certain regions. So with like accounts, which I created in certain regions, which obviously is sort of really tricky to figure out as a sender. However, I do... In this case, I mean, yeah if it's based on running codes? Is based on reference implementations So I mean, I've been discussing for instance, we see Kd people, I think they have also been writing on the email this from which Kd itinerary plugin is here, and they also do have an open implementation in a k mail. Which is a standard email client of Kd, which already displays sort of this. And there's also implementation with the next cloud.

However, since I think the Is not mainly concerned with user experience to a large stand. There will be limits with respect to that. Yeah. So obviously, there no way to test how Gmail does this or, you know, web registers in their product week. But this is obviously clear I think. So So I just... You know, as we think about whether we wanna declare a given spec within something like this. To be functional. We get a working group, we say, okay. We're advancing this. I I think it may not be what Has done traditionally. We should be thinking about how we can actually verify that these things are functional. And I'm fully with you on having free open source software implementations. But if there's a way that we can tell even proprietary vendors, hey, Mh. Here are some messages that have this thing. Mh here's how you can record what your user agent does we can you know, that we can evaluate Isn't something that we we ought to be thinking about. And I know that's not traditional Work.

We need to be thinking about how to do that I agree that, I appreciate your your suggestion and I would like...

And maybe with that in mind, we could reach out to at least develop some of the big makers. And make sure that they are in the loop. So maybe the next step will also be some outreach in place is like Mo other email organizations to... I mean, inform people that if have stopped and seeing whether interest and it could be the next step so between now and francisco idea I mean, whether that's actually the willingness But I do think that many May that. Have the concern that they're getting more and more of this kind of of structured information in multiple ways and it it might be easier for them to actually make a good product if if they have a standard way to the detect what's going on. Thanks. So just we speak to your suggestion, I think it's very much useful to engage also with with as a potentially interested bodies like more. So for instance, that's a recent market san Francisco. I already gave a lightning token to actually advertise this of session answer certainly is the idea to continue this kind conversations. There is actually also an ongoing working group more on dynamic content security issues, which is overlapping a little bit for some of points here. So yes. Let's make sense also in terms of getting windows involved. Okay. Okay. So what I wanted to check now, is everybody clear on a problem statement, the use cases is the things that"

Somewhat confused by speak densities of these presentations. I saw some things go by were stated is as matters of fact, which I think could controversial. Which is another kind of that clarity. So I'm not knowledgeable enough at this point to people to be poised nor I able to be enthusiastically supportive. But if you're asking if find clear answer that is definitely no. Okay. Good. That's that's what I was probing for. So there's still a need to pursue the discussion and get more clarity on where we wanna proceed not just how we wanna proceed. Okay. Let's say has something done. I suppose I would like to to ask more generic question. Do people think there is something in this set of proposed problems to solve that people would like to work on. And maybe we can do a short hands of some kind Okay. Well, let let's take Christopher first and see where we I feel like the list of problems was huge. But I don't see anything that's particularly enlighten in the document as to what the scope"

And do you see things in here as more to Alexa question, do you see pieces of this that you would be interested in working? Potentially. Okay. Thank you. Daniel. I think the pieces that would be the most useful for working good to work on our questions about the preferred format? Location with an email reference to other parts of email, these sort of meta considerations. And I think a charter that focused specifically on on that and had one use case, one specific structured data use case. And the creation of a registry with that one entry in it. Would be a way to avoid boiling the ocean. It the one use case gives us a chance to verify that replacement and references and those are the things are are working. But if we if we start with a charter that says, I wanna know when my pizza gonna be ready. We're we're... You know, we're never gonna get anything concrete. Okay. And I so Christopher putting you still up for that. Haven't really discuss this with barry by, but maybe my suggestion is there should be some possible drafts to write because a lot of the discussions we had in the chat as well was. People might agree on specific things to work on, but they start disagreeing a lot about specific solution. So maybe we have some more concrete examples how this might look like might be also helpful to narrow it down a little bit. Sorry. One one other comment about"

    "text": "the way works. So earlier in your talk, you mentioned that There are multiple different formats. And you were inclined to say let's leave multiple formats because it makes it easier for the sender to use whatever form at they that handy. I think that is completely backwards. So is not a reflection on you. The ecosystem tends to do this. The It we tend to do this. It drives me nuts. We should be specifying one good way to do it. Because if you do one good way, then the generators will say, oh, well, I might as well use that one good way. And and we don't to worry about the diversity of all the receivers. The receivers all have one must implement. Then why would you implement anything else as the sender? So let's try to not have five different ways to do it. I I like that point. Yes. Ted, your hand went up and then back down. Did you wanna say anything? Okay. Okay. So I guess the final thing Who thinks that there nothing to work on here, Raise your hand? Okay. I see no hands. So that's good. Who thinks the right answer to proceeding is continued discussion on the list and perhaps another buff in San Francisco. Got a couple of hands for that. Yeah. And and one half hand here, whatever. Connie. Just raising my hand. Okay. Great. And who thinks that there is a different way forward that you would like to see and then please get up to the microphone and tell us what that is. Daniel I would like to see a concrete charter?"

    "text": "That's narrowed scoped, at least as narrow... I mean, what I described, I think was not particularly narrow, but still narrower than the then the huge laundry laundry list here. I'd like to see a specific charter I'd cs work towards forming working group you you think I think there's work to do here and I think we should have a work group to do it. I don't think it belongs in another work So you think the right path is to work on a charter before San Francisco rather than having another I think so. Yeah. Okay. Work on it over the middle list. Ted. I I think I kind of agree with Ekg, but primarily because what we really need is the scope. Mh. And and the point of the charter in this case is to narrow the scope to something that isn't boiling the ocean and has audience. And then so I think if you come up with a discussion that says, here's the narrow scope. And here are the people who have agreed that if implemented they would deploy it and the other people have agreed that if specified they implemented, then you're well on your way. But I think The question that yours asked the moment go is their work here Yeah, It's the ocean. There are lots of fish. The problem is picking which one you're gonna try and catch. Because some of them gonna be near shore and some of tragic and some of them just out of your reach. And I think this discussion especially this last section had so many different things in it. That any working group that tried to tackle it would not ever complete. And that's not success. Even if you get a few things done along way. So I think realistically, I don't care if you have milestones. I don't care if you have the pretty bits of a charter. If you come to San Francisco with a narrow scope,"

But if you come to San Francisco with a laundry list of this size, I think we'll continue to worry about ocean. Okay. Thanks, Ted. So we're looking at perhaps a working group forming ba in San Francisco is the I have three people in the queue and I have zero minutes left sense here. So I'll let the three of you make very brief comments. John. My calendar is made much easier about what Tensions said say agree with them a hundred percent. The only thing I would add would be try sent targets. I'm getting that charter or scope statement whatever whatever is together at be six weeks out from the seventh francisco school meeting. So we can make decisions at that point to what we want W c tore me barf or something else or whatever. But but I think test exactly cover the issues. Except that I would have added some of the fish by try catch card. Thanks, John. Wes West Frederick All working group forming should have a charter coming you know, along with the the working good think that the translation of the last three people is expect a longer time slot to discuss the charter in San Francisco. And because there's going to be a discussion around it and don't do, you know, fifteen minutes at the end Yeah. Agreed. Cute. You got that Marshall. I I think I agree generally with what I've noticed us at so far, there seems to be a while defined problem hair well. Maybe not particularly well to defined. But a a good problem has been identified, and I think work now needs to be done on figuring out. Okay. Exactly how how we're going to tackle. What are we going tackle hair. Instead of... Because this is something that's already implemented by many"

So thanks everybody for coming here making your comments, and we will look forward to more discussion on the mailing gonna a proposed charter at some point.
