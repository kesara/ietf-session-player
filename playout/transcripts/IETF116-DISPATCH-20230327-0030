So this is the first section of this And this is the trying to meeting the dispatch working group and art area So welcome I'm one of the coach I'm shooting and it's very nice to be able to finalize stayed here after a few years. So it means to me that everything is going to be better right? Yeah. So today also join me, it's my lovely c K. Like to see. Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to a good dispatch session this morning. And also Jam Fa. Okay. So his role will be announced shortly. And one thing to remind that this room we got this auto transcription. So please for all the speakers please say your name clearly, so they can record you. Now the first is about a note well. And due to the time reason, I want a raise way to work by word. But please"

And since this time still is a hybrid meeting, And for the in person participants, please do use this on two to first join the virtual queue and then the physical queue. So we... In that case, we would be able to have this unified queue. And here is the on side two you will see it. And also, last you are speaking, Please keep your audio and the video off. For the mask policy rule, and we you follow the same rule as last meeting in london. Please wear your mask unless you are actively speaking. So here are some resources and the links for your reference. Okay. Now we can start our have read meeting for the dispatch part. No sorry. First is the agenda.

Are you there? Yes. I am. Can you hear me? Yes. When stop? Okay. So this item is about the multi formats specifications There are a few of them I'm gonna go over two of them today explaining kind of what they are why they're useful and why we would like help from To find a home for these specifications. Next slide, please. Okay. So what is a multi format? Effectively it's just a data value. Right? It's a self describing data value. So by looking at the data value, you kind of know what the data value is a is a about. A multi format always starts with a bite header of some kind So it's got a header on it. So it's a string of bytes."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:08:02",
    "text": "It's got a header on it and that header tells you what the rest of the bytes mean the the header effectively shares all these kind of names, the multi format names share one global name space. So If something's a multi format, you can differentiate it from all the other types of multi formats of to give you an example of, like, what a multi format looks like there's a hello world example here at the bottom of the slide the bits in blue are the words hello world encoded in base sixty four Url notepad. So the u in the beginning, that little green u on the left hand side says the next several bytes are gonna be base sixty four Url notepad. And then the blue things are Hello world encoded as that value. That's fundamentally what multi formats do. Next slide, please. So this kind of breaks down what I just said. The header, you know, usually, identifies while the header always identifies what the rest of the bytes mean it usually points to an Rf of some kind to tell people where to look on how to decode the rest of the the value there. Next slide, please. Okay. So why are these useful? Effectively, you know, we've got data, data or kind of encapsulated in these boxes of information and it's nice to have a label on the box to tell you what the data is. So fundamentally, multi formats are label on a box that tells you what's in side the box. The multi formats are useful in text in binary formats. So we already have things like sea in tags and things of that nature But multi formats allow you to kind of have the benefit of those"

    "startTime": "00:10:04",
    "text": "tags, whether or not you're encoding to binary or text formats. Today, multi formats are used to fly all types of basin coatings, like a sixteen, base thirty two, base sixty four, the base we say the following bytes are basic and code basel thirty two, May sixty four encoded. Multi formats called multi hash are used to identify hash strings. So this is a shot two two fifty six value. This is a shark shot three two fifty six Bit length value. This is a shake two fifty six value. This is a blade to two fifty six value, their headers for different types of multi hash. Multi formats are also used to identify types of public keys like e two fifty five, nineteen, that's fifty five nineteen, sec p two fifty six r one so and so forth, as well as codec So multi formats are used as by headers to tell you that the next set of bytes is a sea object. Or a raw git object or a pro object. So multi formats are used as headers to identify all these different types of strings. Light strings. Okay. Next slide, please. So who uses these things? I'm the editor of a number of specifications at the worldwide web consortium, verifiable credentials decentralized identifier data integrity. We use multi formats in all of those specifications. There are variety of large vendors that use multi formats as well, cloudflare flare being one of them Microsoft through their new ion services brave and Opera who have Ip f s built into the browser, use multi base in multi formats on the Ip s community in general uses it. So it's it's largely deployed"

    "text": "today variations of it. There seventeen implementations in a variety of languages today these have existed for many years. In the general ask of dispatch is, you know, given all of these things, is there some way that we can get this usage documented via an If. And a set of ion regis. Okay. Next slide, please. Okay. So real quick. This is one of the independent drafts this is one one of the Ids is a multi format called multi base. And effectively, the multi base format identifies the base encoding for a string. So if you look at the examples at the top, you'll see the first first example start with the letter z. That means this is base fifty eight in encoding using the bitcoin alphabet and then the rest of it is the string. By the way, each one of these examples is string hello worlds encoded in a different base format. The second one is a little u that means based sixty four Url, no padding, the next one is the little b, which means base thirty two, no padding, The next one is base sixteen, hex encoding, use uppercase letters. Right? So that lets you know very clearly what the base the following piece. Encoding for the binary string is And this is useful in tech formats like Jason in Yam. So that's multi base in a nutshell. That's the whole that's the entirety of what multi bay does. Next slide, please. Okay. Multi hash is the next one. So multi hash is a multi format, but unlike multi base, which is kind of a tech string format Multi hash is a binary header. Right? And so let's say that you have a crypto hash"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:14:03",
    "text": "that's two hundred and fifty six bits in length It's sometimes useful to put a header on that value to tell you whether or not it is a shot too, two hundred and fifty six bit hash or s three two hundred fifty six pet hash, or shake two fifty six. Hash. Right? So that little header that the twelve sixteen and in nineteen tells you what the rest of the bytes are, What type of hash it is. The other really nice thing about multi formats is they compose really nicely. So the very bottom example you see here in multi basin coded it starts with a z, that means this is a base fifty eight bitcoin alphabet encoded value. And then the the six is effectively encoding of the the multi hash value with the hash following in the blue characters. To the right. So you can compose these things together to put different headers on things to represent these these data values with precision, both in text based and binary based formats. Next slide, please. Okay. So this is the last slide the question is, where does this fit at. I'm gonna suggest that the preferred path here is a d sponsored. I don't know if that's the best path, but it feels like it fits both of these specs that I described are, like, two to four page specifications. They're really tiny specifications that are effectively documenting mature implementations Most of the content in these specifications would exist in in Ion a registry of some kinds. If eighty sponsored isn't the way to go, maybe Cfr g because a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about is used in security architectures and systems"

There's is also the question of you know, a future potential path, which is a multi format working group at I I suggest that it's too early for that. We have two fairly simple formats that we could document. And depending on how that goes in what the reaction is to those then maybe in the future, we can start looking at some of the other multi format. So that will require more cat hurting in time. Okay. So that is that is that is effectively in the introduction to this work I have not been looking at the chat so we could probably do questions, concerns. Whatever at this point come. Great. Thank you very much for presenting your work. So just a reminder, please state your name clearly at the mic before speaking, it will help with the auto transcription.

This is Sean turner. I'm channel richard Barnes from the channel. I guess this question is... Mac is a clarifying question is my impression is that these multi x things are usually pretty domain specific. Wonder whether there's a need for a global registry thing. Yes. Sorry. Yeah. I can Manny. Did you hear the question? global registry thing, there's a global name space. That is viewed as a good thing at this point, you know, it it that's up for debate. But multi format tend to, you know, use a global registry today. That's kinda how they they're set to work. Okay. Thank you. Marie or in the queue?"

My backlog is gonna get very big very quickly. So that's probably the slowest way. We should look at other alternatives. Like Okay. Hello. My name is Martin dew. And I want to ask for this hello example, can you also do that in various other languages and escaped to on. Or does it work only ask it's not asking only. It's any binary string. So yes, you can do it other languages. Binary is not doesn't say it tell me what text is it it is. You have to say what character what charles is otherwise that doesn't apply. Yep. Understood it. Martin does the response affect your view on the dispatch question? Where this work should go if it should go forward Well, the the Idea should definitely make sure that questions like these are good solved well. So I I don't know which Alternative it might work best for that. But... Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So next in the queue, Jonathan Rosenberg. Jonathan and Rosenberg. Can you clarify I was surprised there's no magic cookie In front of this, without this, this will overlap with the name space of all existing strings that show up in all kinds of places that are just you encoded. This is somewhat related to whether this is a domain specific encoding or is something meant for global use. So you would car is there a reason there's no magic cookie in front of it? At present, it hasn't needed one. But that doesn't mean that that's not a bad design."

I I expressed so my this earlier but I don't fully understand steve this. You're talking about clothing registered use already. If there's a global registry use already then got it's not clearly needed I registry or maybe we two. I worried about the same introduce or or magic something telling tell idea what this is as been mentioned. If it's done and people that and deployed it maybe would get the if I enter registry needed to draw, we get the The ad and the To sign off operation the registry and said the documents of the Is informational documents just describe hey specification developed somewhere else. And I'm also worried about what I think is in kit to pursue this in parallel and I f and w three because that's just an invitation manner of confusion and a lot of time and we a lot of kinda So I'll get last of last questions sure. I think this dispatch question is this ought we need more clarification on this. And then maybe it goes to the Is rather. Thanks.

I think we should do it etf, I think that's a much better choice than w three or just doing it sort of as a separate, you know, standalone github project, I think that makes it much easier to reference and use the other places. And I think it'll be easier to do at I F and w. Now, that leads to the question of where in the And I'm gonna have a question for you about this second. I definitely don't think this is Cf, Of course, they make some of the things that end up as strings here, but I think that's totally the wrong place to do it. Think it should be done. Inside of, you know, basically somewhere in the art area. Don't think this is a good thing to do through the Is. Again, because of the Ion And this comes to my question, which I think one of the things that may be the hardest part about this is determine the sort of registration procedures for these, particularly for very short numbers for or short strings versus longer strengths on this thing. So what's Can you say a little bit more about the current policies for deciding what things get a new string in this... And in how it's been used so far today and what's sync stone? Yeah. It's a fairly loose open process today. It's got three people in a github registry that are or sorry, a github repository that decide who gets the low numbers and who gets the high numbers. There hasn't been a lot of fighting over it. But yeah. I mean, it's run more or less like you would see an Eye registry run by a set of experts. Right? Except it's a good repo. Right. Yeah. No. I mean, that's much the same. And hopefully the same people would be willing to do it as the experts As well. So I do think that just sort of hearing that answer makes me think though that I was an Ad, I would not want ad d sponsor this. This is going to get into a very complicated fairly quickly. And also you have the timing issues of of the obvious To do it. So I know it sounds nuts that we'd spin up a little mini working group to do something that's only a three page document"

Next in the queue is Ted hardy. I'm currently Ted hardy, but I'm willing for him to be ted hardy if he really likes. So I actually put myself in queue to say, I think this needs a small working group. I don't know that it's entirely trivial, but I definitely think it needs something a little bit more than eighty sponsored. I agree that it's good work and should go forward. I think part of the reason I think it needs a little working group is it also gives you place to concentrate the people who will then look at multi hash and some of the other uses of multi formats to make sure that they're well understood by the rest of the community because I kind suspect once this is in place, people will go Hey, can I shut this in a data uri right and that means I need a media type for it? So... Or there there's a bunch of other successor work that's going to leap at this if it gets standardized, and I think having a a small working group to how that successor work quickly would be useful? Thanks. Thank you, Ted. I'm gonna cut the qc soon as it's growing. So if you want to join, please getting quickly, next, Eric risk order. Yes. Erica. Hi. So maybe I missed this in in in discussion, but What is the change control right behind this? Namely do you think it's done? And do you think if we decided that the right letter to indicate that it was like, you know, ask you text or z, Would that be cool? That's a great question. We have the tension we have right now is that we have seventeen implementations and they deployed it and they've kind of decided that z means"

But I mean, that's kinda of what the Process is about is to asked hard questions have the current implementation done the right thing I mean, I think that you know, that those sorts of discussions are on the table. If we are talking mini working group, good one Team z here. So, you know okay. I mean so I think I'm not I mean, I guess, that I think this goes the question I'm working to the sponsored memory if like you wanna change anything and you wanna register the cop point registry, and then maybe, like, working group the right answer, but if you just want... But if you actually wanna, like, reopen the patient like, actually make real changes then like makes more sense I do wanna respond to this, like, don't like like, francesca Out so, like, don't do any sponsored. Like, by definition, like the process requires to the ad And so I don't understand how possible we could be faster to do, like, a work group the eighty sponsor. That seems seems like. Okay. So just to summarize, I think, there's a bit of discussion about whether it's faster to do things a sponsored or working group it's still in both the Ad in either case. Okay. Next in the queue. We have Christopher Allen. Yes. Thank you. I wanted I'm I'm in support of this like man. I'm bridging multiple standards, worlds, And part of the reason for this is that this type of specification really belongs at the Level and W three just is not really suited for this type of thing. If it does if it can't be an informational draft of some kind then I would also love to maybe, you know, think about in the working group running into a parallel problem with Sea where we need to have a bunch of tags registered for a lot of different hash algorithms"

Would be very parallel in a very useful discussion that to resolve both of those at the same time. That's it. Thank you very much. So coming up, I've looked the queue. So if you have a view, please show and jab we'll pick it up that way, Please do discuss when we talking about working groups. I haven't heard anyone mention the need for a boss. I'm assuming this would be a non buff required working group. Harold, Europe next. I this stamp. Just to I was looking at the format I'm trying to remember a one from nineteen seventy eight. And this format lacks the way to the term the end of the string? And a number of other features that obviously be needle energy application, so it's just a little tiny component of of the system. So it's hard to evaluate. The registration thing registers keys in a very small space. So I don't know if case is significantly, so it's either twenty six or double that? So Obviously, free for all is not the right name of the game. You need negotiation procedures. Only usage cited are w c related as far as I can tell? So one possible option is to say okay.

Then we have a very difficult sort of interoperability question to be asking ourselves, is this going to improve interoperability when the only real recourse you have is to essentially implement every single code point that's in the registry.

We should have this to do things quickly and and then without relying an Ad, but their jobs are already really hard. Thank you for your service.

So I think that the way to dispatch this really depends on what the intent of the authors really is what they actually wanna get done.

So this is not be I believe somebody said this is not a full system solution. You still have to say, within your protocol, this is a multi format thing And in a lot of cases, I think that that ends up just throwing the question of what we allow in this. To to another format in another layer, and that leads to complexity. K. Very much for your input. So at the end of this item, it sounds like there are two options going forward. One is Is with the appropriate average rich Demonstrations and the other is a small working grape. Which very much depends on the authors. How much change control they want to give over.

You can reveal use reveal parts of the information hide others. And so we wanted a very flexible format able to do this and that could also be very secure. So we conceived of a document as basically a subject and some information not that subject. Doc... Those pieces of subject and information of the subject are also documents. So we have a very hierarchical nested structure. Again it's all based on a deter sea more. One of the main things and so this basically allows you to nest envelopes or compose. Very easily. The notion structure of an envelope is just object and a instead of assertion about that subject and the insertion is the pre object. So you're probably familiar with semantic triples, but envelopes go far beyond that. Basic concept even though they're to have that kind of structure. So this is a semantic triple Allison bob. This is what you see down below is what we call notation. It's a way of summarizing this the actual Sea format and human format. The actual envelope implementation is a type. Do you see there on the right. And you see there's actually eight cases that include envelopes with sub envelopes, sea more coated which is just a leaf I've envelopes have been wrapped for purposes I'll scrap leader. And but also things like additional assertion encrypted and. And this is one of the things that envelopes allow is holder based. So if you receive an envelope as a secured document, you can parts and still preserve the merkel tree, which basically allows youtube to a live price without about invalid signatures. Sorry to here with you we do have someone in the queue if it's just a clarifying question, no it can wait to the end. Sorry. Do continue. Okay.

String. So I wanna show you brief a little bit power envelopes. In this case, we have this triple. You can add either five add additional assertion. So envelopes allow complex metadata or assertion with assertion as much you like. So there's five positions you can add additional assertion. In this case, we've added searching the subject, Alice. You consider o one p one. Without the assertion. The second location you can add them, is is on the actual case nodes. We've added an insertion.

So we based it on S after surveying a bunch mats and we settle sea because of these attributes entries has that are very favorable.

The point of deter, I'm not gonna go over bullet point here, but but I've couple a couple of. Yeah. It's very important to make sure that when you're especially when you're dealing with verifiable credentials things like that that you have a deter code.

So our view is that we should be opinionated about what we want as long as we're going implementing best practices, one of the main So we looked around and and said, are there any other codecs that out there that actually implement sea deter as a core value we didn't funny. So we've written two of them, which are open source stuff on github one in Swift the other roster. Arc the C more are here gonna make it harder to write, non or each an error to read non compliant sea so we're very strict about we what we read in what we accept. As well formed. Part the issue form and coding map, well, on this very long, that's pretty much a subtle issue in sea mark. One unsettled issue in the Sea group, which is how of how longer numerical representations are collapsed down to shorter Numerical representation. You know, in in Json, you can compose and non on you can you can write zero in a million different ways. We want only one way to write zero. And so we've basically expect that in our Internet draft. Some the pushback we've gotten has basically said that this should... You know, that it's okay. You as long as you define where the field is floating point or integer it doesn't matter. That's not my view in general in terms of and other we can get into. Just like that.

So our questions for dispatch are kind of diverse so in the in the overall envelope format, Although it will likely be used by security groups in the future and it has some really nice capabilities there. You know, it isn't Jose. It has no signatures in many ways, it is a... It is a structure. It's, you know, it's structured format, it just happens to be very friendly because of the for use by other protocols that, you know, need the deter, but also need the structure that allows them to do some greater privacy and things of that nature. You know, there is only one crypto function in it, which is a hash algorithm. So I would really prefer not to have to go up the security dispatch direction and into a security group in the same way, you know, sea doesn't have to go to a security group to do things because you know, because Uses it or something.

You started off talking about blockchain and that led me down to the belief that you have specific targeted use cases, but I think you're describing a fairly generic type of thing it could be used in many places. Can you give examples of Etf working groups that might want to use this in the long run, What protocols might this be used for. Well, I'll I'll start with a few. There is some discussion about how we what is the future of X dot five zero nine, you know, how do we in various future protocols allow for privacy through and non correlation. So know, how do I as a party making a representation whether or not that's a verifiable credential or some type of supply chain certification or other kinds of statements, be able to sign those statements but then basically say, hey, wait, not gonna give you all of the details of it because you're not entitled to the higher thing.

I think that if we look at this presentation and we grid out the Dc bar from the envelope becomes a little bit easier, I think Dc work going just see makes lot sense be found ambiguity and the draft that sounds like something that would worth addressing because, you know, the deter is great for when you want to do operations. The envelope thing, I have pretty substantial concerns about. Spent quite a lot of time in the last couple of months playing with pro off and how to do very similar type things with making it deter and then sign and actually representing data in a way which is useful. And I'm very nervous that Envelope is too generic. It it seems like the sort of thing where it doesn't provide any interoperability to find it as it currently stands because the semantics of what all of these links mean is an application profile dependent thing. And I'm really worried. If you go and look at what we've done elsewhere with photography is when you have ambiguity and extensions, you end up with something which might be, you know, signed. It's deter, but you don't know what to do with it unless you have the application. Much. So I really would like to see folks come back with more specific use cases with what to do with one of these container formats and how what standardization would that.

Second goal is to improve little bit rate speech speech coding quality with and side information, And the third goal is to do the same but for music quality Next slide, please. So why are we proposing that? So first, is that recent advancements in speech and audio coding have really made things possible that we didn't even think were possible back in twenty twelve. But then why in Opus and why not a new codec basically, you know, deploying a new codec is very expensive. It is time consuming. Opus is already deploy to billions of devices. So we are proposing a simple upgrade that can be done gradually rather than pushing a new it and also, in general having a single codec for a call, reduces interoperability issues. Next slide please. Now how we're proposing to do this Opus already has pattern mechanism that allows to wouldn't random bytes that are ignored, normally. And so we are proposing to use this padding as an stan mechanism. That means that the main opus bits do not change their definition everything remains compatible. And any order order that does not know about these extensions. We'll see the padding ignore it and compatibility will be preserved. So a proposal for the extension format is in the draft on the slide. So you can look that up for more details."

And the way we're proposing to do that is to code very low bit rate redundant acoustic features for the past audio within each packet. Practically, what this means is that each twenty millisecond packet can actually contain one second of previous audio coded at a very little bit rate, which means that you have about fifty times redundancy for about a total cost of about thirty two kilobits per second. And then you use these features with a irr code to synthesized the audio that was missed during a packet loss event. So I have some audio samples. I'll be playing them from my phone. The first sample I will play is actually without loss, so you can hear the... What the sample looks like. The second sample will be with a lot of loss using Opus and the existing redundancy mechanism called L r r. And the third sample will be what is achieved with deep redundancy. To administer on that into animals. Is frequently a very difficult matter. And yet sometimes it's necessary to do so. To administer next This we could get a very difficult matter. Times it. To do so.

On the left side, to obviously filling with zeros is very bad. We have also neuro Plc that you can try an experimental branch and you can see there the quality that it achieves. It it is better than the standard of plc, but still limited. And when using dread either with or without L r As you can see in the circle, we actually get through a quality that is very close to the Clean speech. That was evaluated on the packet loss conceal challenge data that was provided by Microsoft Next slide, please. So we do have running code for deeper redundancy. It is in the Opus repository in the Ex p neural f three branch. The current code takes around five to ten percent Cpu run a recent laptop We are working on reducing that complexity. We believe it's possible to reduce that. For more details, we also have a paper that is out and will be presented at the upcoming two thousand twenty three. So that was for the first call.

It is something we can discuss the the technology in the way we have it now is highly optimized for the case of redundancy, for example, you decode going backwards. And it uses a lot of prediction. So it's really optimized for that. You could use the same technology to make it codec out of this. I'm We can debate how this is useful or not within Opus. Specifically. It's not technologically impossible. We just need to discuss Great. And then second just as really a small technical comment. whether it's useful in... Okay. You talk about this idea of just putting on the padding bits so that it like, is basically backwards compatible. Honestly, you're not gonna send this overhead unless you know that we see receive it, So you're gonna probably signal it anyway. In that case, you could probably do it as a proper negotiated extension. Again, it's just a small tech comment coming in. Thank you. Yeah.

An endpoint with an emergency passport profile, Again, what we are asking, the Fcc commission is to make a real in swing that every device that comes out of the manufacturing. We'll have it a passport profile that includes the emergency access in mechanisms all credentials. That is one thing. Second aspect is, we are also asking, you know, the the access networks, like, in essentially, hot spots to be able to support that passport profile. Now in what for how they make the room making these Think that the key question is It is about liability. Today, even if you look at eight two dot eleven, they're defined mechanisms for emergency thing. But nobody no device support signal ignore network supports it. I think the the issue is the liability. If there's a call failure, you know, who is protected? I think that's... Now what we asking is by bringing the open running into the equation, essentially, initially, if Since can step in and say that, you know, if there's a call failure we are we are going to provide immunity to the access. So we are extending the W s, you know, the legal framework between the access network and the And... And the and the identity provider, to include rules what eli calling. Think that is the the new legal things. But from the solution point of view again, There's an emergency passport profile an access network ability you to signal those emergency or C or saying that I'll give you access if you're making a nine call, And the final the other elements are in the system just hiring connectivity does not solve my dialing problem.
