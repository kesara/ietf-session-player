So are these two some stuff routers, indeed, for the same stuff net work and the same infrastructure link. This case. It could also be, different stop networks, same infrastructure link. Or it could be, same supplement network different infrastructure links. That's another case. Maybe that that case, I'm not sure. Could be out of scope, the last one. Yeah. And so I can't remember. I can't remember his Ted. I can't remember if we if we explicitly make make make make multilink multi adjacent infrastructure link out of scope or not. Gonna just go look at the document when I sit down. But, the other thing is for single adjacent infrastructure link. I don't think it actually matters whether the 2 stub routers are serving the same stub network because the point is that we're just advertising I we have to have an ipv6 prefix on the adjacent infrastructure link some stub router has to do that. It doesn't matter what stub network serving. It just has to be some stub router doing it. And in fact, we see situations where indeed we do have 2 stub networks, and it is possible for the stub routers to ping pong back and forth. Because of that. And we we just need text that says how to deal with that.

Darren is the one who wrote that on reading the par the section now to try to remember where it is. Oh, So Let me just point out that there are a couple of editorial comments at the end of the section that are probably worth looking at. Jonathon, could you maybe scroll down a little bit? Yeah. To to to There you go. So one of the things to say about this is that currently the so the threat implementation of this we actually generate prefix that we know is gonna be the same across all stub routers for a particular stub net which does not prevent us from having 2 stub networks and still having the problem. But but a single sub network, we don't. And also with 2 stub networks. If you've got multiple stub routers per stub network, the likelihood of all of the stub routers that we're advertising the prefix for the same stub network going away is much lower. So we see the less often. But, the point is, that, So the first point is we don't actually have to advertise the stale prefix. We can just configure it on link. And then, if somebody remembers"

We don't actually need to continue sending the advertisement, which means we don't need to continue sort of polluting the routing table of all the devices on the network with stale data So that's one point. The other point is, whenever possible we probably try to have all the stub routers use the same prefix. All the sub routers for a particular stub network if there is more than 1. And currently with thread, we do that by using a constant that's part of the thread network. So that's easy. For wifi, We don't really have a good answer for that. As it says up here, we could use something like the the the the SSID, I guess, is like a a number I think. So We could maybe use that as the prefix. But, so so if we're gonna write some text, the question is, do people agree with that solution? Cause if we if we agree that that's a good approach, then let's just update the text. If we think that's, like, particularly the SSID thing, like, nobody here as far as I know has ever tried that. I don't actually know how well that's gonna work, but in theory, It's not a bad solution. It's not a bad approach, and we have definitely had with the X Pan ID approach. So can we write some text in here that captures both of those. One approach we could use would be to, to just say if possible use an identifier that's specific to the stub network. And, we can leave it unspecified as to how to use it although we could also give examples like the X Pan ID. And I think maybe that would be sufficient. Does that make sense? Yes. Test me. Okay.

Separately, obviously, it would be best, I think, if all of the stub routers that, Might advertise a prefix on the stub network could converge on a single prefix. Yeah. We don't currently require that. Currently, we just assume that every every stub router will allocate a prefix that will potentially be advertised on the stub network but if that stub router goes away, then some other stub router might advertise a different prefix on the stub network. So So the reason for this text is just to to talk about the fact that stub routers have to have to allocate a prefix that they can advertise on the on the on the stub network. So we could change this so that it Oh, and the other thing is, previously the assumption was that the stub router would use this prefix for both the AIL and the stub network, and the stub network is sort of constant, except that a stub network partition.

So we can't use the same in that case. And the advantage of having each sub router have its own prefix is essentially that when this partitioning event occurs, we, we are able to successfully number both networks and provide routing to both networks. Because by definition, each sub router will be connected to 1 or the other of these these partitions. So that's why we have this text here. Whether that's the right solution is another question, but maybe that explains what this is for. We don't have the AIL problem anymore because of Yeah.

On the mic, please. Sorry about that. Yeah, so so in the case that the stub network is a Wi Fi network, then the the RA behavior that we were just talking about 521 is also gonna be required on the stub network so that we don't screw up the routing there because you might have a device on the stub network that remembers a prefix that was advertised router, which is subsequently drawn it.

And what you're we are trying to do here is to build a device that you can plug into existing home networks. Saying that the home network doesn't comply with an RSC, saying that there is an SSID collision, saying that the not stable is not acceptable in the home. Now this doesn't mean that we need to explicitly take those cases into account. But it means that even those that that home networks are going to be misconfigured statistically that's inevitable And we need to make sure that things don't go horribly wrong. In the case. Where the AI is not stable for their SSID collisions and so on. Because in the home network, any possible misconfiguration is going to happen. That's inevitable. So I I I agree with your principal, but I don't agree with all of your conclusions. The first conclusion that I don't agree with is the one about the SSID. I think the SSID in a home network is unlikely to have properties that would conflict with the use that we've talked about for it, although we're not requiring that use. And the reason I say it is because people just don't set up multi subnet home networks. That's a very unusual thing. And the person who does a multi subnet home network is either an expert or they're using a stub router. Using a stub router. We have defined stub routers as not providing routing. So not providing transit. So so we're explicitly excluding that particular situation. That's possible to stub router could through stupidity advertise an SSID that is the same as the home router SSID. And that would has massive problems. So we definitely don't want that.

And so we have some experience with the problems that you're talking about. And there are a couple things to say about that. One is that for the most part, cheap home routers are fine. We we never see issues with cheap home routers. We never see issues with like, you know, something that's that's like a when I say cheap, that's actually also somewhat pejorative because sometimes they're not cheap.

There are exceptions For example, we've seen some home routers that advertise, Like, you can do they they they support DHCP V Six PD. But if you ask for a prefix, they give you the same one that's on the link. So I actually have code in our implementation. The compares the prefix that's on the AIL with the prefix that we were given with PD. And if we get the raw the same prefix with PD, We just chuck it. And we we mark that link as not supporting PD.

Is there an arc a snack architecture thing that says that there's a sort of model of addressing that you would expect see when a stop network appears on a home network. So so, I mean, Julia's actually kinda articulated this pretty well, that we can't assume anything in particular about the home network. And if there's there's a misconfiguration on the home network, a, we should do maybe do something to work around it, but, b, we should also try to get them to fix it. So The question is, is this something that happens and what would happen if it did happen? So for example, let's let's say there's a host on stub network. And the host on the stub network is trying to communicate to a host that's on the adjacent infrastructure a work. There's only a GUA on the adjacent infrastructure link but PD isn't working, so we don't have a GUA on the stub network. Yeah. Yeah. In that case, what's what's the device on the stub network gonna do is the source address selection process gonna going to going and I should say the desk source and destination address Is that gonna work? Or is this gonna fail? Pair the ULA. It won't get model get anything else. Well, right. So so if if it produces the ULA and the GOA, then that's fine because it'll work. Right? Like, it is nominally misconfiguration, but as long as the host doesn't, like, look at that and say, well, this is invalid. I'm just gonna say the host is unreachable. Then we're okay. If it looks at it and says this is invalid, the host is unreachable, then we're in trouble. So, yeah, if you can if you forget, well, forget the residential one where 74 says you say it's a campus network. There's no requirement for campuses to run your days.

I I didn't I didn't I didn't state that in my list of cases, but but, yeah, we should just ignore any advertisement we see from stub routers for making this determination. And and the other point he mentioned, like, do we have a section for that? I think there was another, open points coming from mailing list discussion is that we would somebody said, well, we would like to see a complete list of all the elements in the RA, and complete list of how we set it and also why we set it that way. So that would be as a new section probably Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's, yeah, we should just have a section that is constructing RAs. Yeah. So kind of complete our array for dummies, overview Yeah. Yeah. And and also, there's probably a section on constructing RAs and then possibly either we have subsections for AL and stub, or we just have two sections, one for AI all in one for Starbucks. They're so different that weekend. Join them together. Because I I think on the stub network, we pretty much never wanna set the m bit, and we pretty much never wanna set the o bit because We're not actually specifying that the stub router knows how to do DHCP. And that's what those bits signify Yeah. And then maybe for for that part, for subnetwork, it's also technology dependent because threats, you know, it doesn't have any RAs, for example, and it's all the ways to do the Yeah. Wow. Wi Fi, probably has the RAs. Right. So, I mean, we need to we need to specify how to do RAs for network that use it and for networks that don't use it, I think we can just say they are responsible for figuring this out and here's what they need to accomplish."

Yeah, we we can talk about that offline. Great. Okay. Clarify text as needed. It's the same text we were just editing. Participant question, will it have an impact impact on the state machines when we start processing these Ares new flag, it's it's So I Tom think do we write a state machine for for RAs. We don't have. Oh, we we have a state machine for whether or not it's advertising prefix. Right. Yeah. So, I mean, I think, If we certainly, if we write a state machine, for doing RAs, then it would have to it would have to just it would have to include this information But since we don't currently have one, the question is when we add the section, does the section just run just describe the state machine? Were does it just do text? And I I think we should look at what we write and see if it looks like it gonna be more or less confusing. Because the problem with state machines is is that sometimes they are much clearer you know, like, like, if you don't do the state machine, then it's not really clear what to do. Other times, there are a lot of work to read and you have form a mental model of what you're gonna do. And if you're not actually gonna implement the state machine, has a state machine you're doing a lot of extra work. So we need to just, like, probably write it in text and then say, well, what would this look like if we wrote it as machine, and would that be better?"

Like, the design proposed in our draft definitely says you. Is it is it just the deployment model suggests that you get in the new prefix? Right? Sarategically, you could get the same, but that would require changes to PD relay specification because it may because, ideally, RFC requirements explicitly says that you have to keep the route pointing to link local address of the client even if the client, if the labor and eligibility detection tells you that link local is not here anymore in case it comes back, which means if you had the old route and you keep gives the same prefix and you move to another view of our turbines and that Right? They will have 2 routes pointing to like conflicting routes and you'll get packet loss. Right? So if you want to have a prefix mobility, we would need to change this. And it was definitely.

There's no we can't really tell the difference between PD is not available. And, you know, PD ran out of prefixes. Right?

Home networks. And so if we want we need to ask anyway even if the PD bit is 0, the pivot is 0. So Yeah. I mean, the the other the other challenge with CD is that if you got multiple stub routers. Obviously, each one of them has a different identity, and so it's gonna get a different prefix. And we don't want them all to have prefix as we want only one prefix.

So 2, this I I just wanna interject one thing into this discussion about release, which is that, we, we have the same problem with DHCP provided prefix that we have with any other prefix that might change over time, which is that hosts might still have routing table entries and might still have address configured on that prefix because of the prefix lifetime that we advertise. So we need to make sure that we keep we don't release the prefix until the valid lifetime that we advertised has expired. The prefix would never but but the prefix would The prefix is I I would argue that we would never should never send an RA on the AAL with a prefix that we got. If we go to pretax, it's Now I'm talking about I'm talking about in the stub network. So this is a non threat case. On the non in the non thread case where we have, like, a wifi network or whatever that's a stub network then we need to make sure that the router advertisement that we advertise, that we honor the the valid lifetime router advertisement. And that may mean that when we first get a prefix delegation that we set maybe a relatively short preferred lifetime, because I think if we set a really short valid lifetime, the device might just ignore it. Yeah. But that's what we should do. And then I'll get up. No. Yeah. So I like the way we are moving back from digital to analog queues, by the way. And we have only a couple of minutes. Yeah. And I just wanted to to say that, okay, I think the something about the release is maybe good to mention in the draft. I don't think it's currently mentioned. So it's the same as Lourenco's had, Yeah. Maybe that also make that explicit. It seems like we need to do a fair amount of additional tech in order to describe the thing that I just mentioned, and and that would include the release stuff. Yeah. That's right. So,"

In fact, I think we are they're we're already doing that, aren't Dewey? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's that's excellent. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of our goals with the with the matter home gateway work is try and get all this stuff into the home gateways that we needed in order to make this stuff work smoothly. We should definitely work with Tim on that draft, then we really need it to any that and do people know which restaurant I'm talking about? Yeah. I thought it was a no brainer. Yeah. Can you start a thread? It's like, hey. Can, like, We need this. Snack needs this. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, like, if you start a thread, I'll say, like, look, you know, I'll Yeah, guys. So, We have 1 minute left. I was just comment, Richard. I was gonna say, At this point, I think correct me if I'm wrong, Ted, I think that someone can go implement with some Oops says maybe this document and that might be worth saying. And the the next step is it might be it might be interesting to have some for a to be able to do some kind of interop, which other than CSA matter. So, Michael, did you just volunteer to do that implementation? Is that right? God, I'd love to be. It's telling you that but but I I'm Sounds like that. I would really like to tell you that, but I'm not. So, I think that's right, and it might be fun to do a hackathon thing if anybody's interested in doing that. In in Brisbane. Yeah. Because nobody will be there or what. That we were actually thinking calling some university students in if they can read your draft and implement it, Yeah. Great. Yep. Let's see how far that goes. Sounds good. Yeah, with that, We"

So what we are going to do is just copy over issues and their comments as our meeting minutes notes. And that still has a lot of work to do till that I the next idea of meeting. Thank you. Well, I think they have a much clearer idea of what that work is Yeah. And a real big thank you to Ted and Jonathan. And everybody here for your very, super collaborative. This is the most fun I've ever had in the IETF working group. So thank you. That's how it should be. Thank you, guys. We're done. Thank you. Thanks, Jonathan. But then It wasn't bad. That was just a spectacular sofa And I'd love that they came over. The invitation last minute, like, Is it exactly? The things that it's, like, even unless you Yes. From the specification. It should be already handling"
