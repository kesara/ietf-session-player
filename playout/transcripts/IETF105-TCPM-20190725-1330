    "text": "please so first let\u0027s quickly recap hi start so traditional slow start for TCP has a flaw so it does exponential increase but it can potentially overshoot the ideal sending rate by a lot and this causes massive packet drops and then TCP spends multiple round-trip times recovering from those losses even if you have logically algorithms like rack sometimes this hands up causing retransmission timeout so high start is a paper that was published which had two schemes to solve this problem so the Cole here is to exit slow start early before the Mass Effect packet loss happens so the paper had two algorithms one was based on deal increase and the other was based on entropic at arrival the original paper suggested that the sender run both of these algorithms in parallel and then exit slow start early the problem is that the inter packet arrival algorithm does not really work well because there is a lot of act compression happening both on the receiver because of things like RC as well as I meant LRO and as well as the network doing ACK compression the dealer increase algorithm works but we find that it has a lot of false positives this happens because of latency fluctuations on wireless links it also happens because there could be a large burst from another flow that could cause transient queue build-up which could last multiple round-trip times and then you and then the fluid ends up exiting slow start very early and then congestion avoidance will take a long time to ramp up next slide please so what is the deal increase algorithm the goal is to keep track of the minimum of 0 delta T in each round so four rounds where so we keep track of this minimum oddity until the condition window is higher than the minimum ssthresh value this is to ensure that slow start does not exit too early there\u0027s some protection and high start for not exiting slow start early so the first few rounds we know not eyes it\u0027s lost out even if delay is increasing once that condition is met then we calculate bt a based on the last rounds observed minimal T and if the current round our GT is greater than a certain threshold from the last minimum observed our treaty then we exit slow start and we capture the value of insets Thresh I\u0027m loading down the constants that is used in the current implementation and windows I I believe that the constants are very similar in Linux based on mailing list discussions next slide please so why is this not sufficient the problem here is that even if you do this only for the initial slow start the slow start could exit prematurely because of "

    "text": "at all possible and the answer is that perhaps no that\u0027s probably not a good solution because the receiver may interact with a variety of devices and the attacks may still work as intended in many connections and even considering a specific sender perhaps the sender may offer a mixed traffic pattern where the attacks may work as intended for some part of that traffic so a conclusion is that a solution to this problem should be at the segment granularity so what we are proposing in this document is what we call the AK pull mechanism and it would make use of one of the TCP heavy Reserve beads which is defining the document as the active flag this would be more specifically the sixth date of the 13th bite of the TCP header and the mechanism would be as follows the sender if the sender wants to request an immediate AK for DT segment then it sets the at poles like and on the receiver side upon reception of a data segment with the approach lock set and the receiver if it conforms to this specification it must send the ACK immediately there\u0027s a question okay then after the internet graph submission deadline there was some nice discussion on the mailing list there was good feedback many good comments that were sent on the list I would like to thank everyone for that and I\u0027ve tried to summarize the feedback on this slide so one point is that of course one of the TCP header reserve bids is an expensive resource and we are well aware of it so that means that we need to carefully assess the pros and cons of this proposal or some perhaps some alternatives then also the use of the maximum AG delay option was suggested however with that option we understand there might be two issues one is that it\u0027s a an option that would not be a solution offering sorry a solution at the second granularity and on the other hand this option entails another head of 28 bits which might be not so good in some scenarios such as IOT then there was another comment or suggestion like perhaps we might redefine the push flag as having the octal semantics this could be phrased as a tcp me not delay acts for data segments with the push flag which in principle would be allowed by RFC 1122 then there were some reports about how is actually the bush flag being used in the Windows and Linux implementations they said the push record the message boundary and at the receiver side neither windows nor nor Linux sandy acts immediately upon receiving semijns with the bushwhack set so it means that in these implementations that push flag is not being used as having the opossum antics "
