So this were went into last call quite a few weeks ago. That last call has expired, I believe. That's working group last cool. That is. The main feedback was just the it needed a bit more kind of examples and how you would put it into a spec for, like, mail calendars because this is kind of the template for how sharing works everywhere, but it needs like a specific example.

So the next item is calendars and contacts, and Neil is back for that. see. We're gonna do calendars first, I guess. Let's Sure. Calendar is the simple one in that nothing's really changed since last time. We believe the spec is basically ready. but we are waiting to see if there are any revisions to JS calendar. I think there's a Jess calendar that's coming as the data format we're using. We don't wanna standardize the jamap bit until we know that the data format is kind of kind of kind of kind of definitely final. But I think we worked through all the issues we had on the Jmap a bit of that spec. So probably some more implementation experience will be good on that. if anyone's start implementing let me know. We've obviously got quiet complete implementation at Fast Mill. but we'll want to update that to match the final version before we push that forward. So, yeah, We think that's anybody waiting for JS calendar based is the summary on that one. Okay. And we'll switch over to This one is a bit more interesting. Yep. contact?

So I'm gonna run through a quick summary of the changes and kind of what's next for that draft. We were mainly again waiting on the data format, which is why I hadn't updated it in a while, but Janet's contact is is this close to being done. Robert is just handling the last few bits of feedback from the IETF last call on that. So we expect Jess contact to be published. pretty soon. And once that's done, Jaymout for contacts is really straightforward because it's just that data format plus map for the synchronization, and there's really not much more to it. So the changes we've got Contact groups are no longer separate type to oh, sorry. I can go backwards. -- to contacts. This is because this is what's happened in JS contact as well as the data format. It's kind of a single type. So have a look at the data format. formal on that, but it we thought it made more sense to just treat it the same. So there was consistency between the data format and the synchronization protocol. So, essentially, it's a it's a contact card with type equals So a kind, I think, equals group. represents group, and you can have a member's property with a set of UIDs for the members. of that group. The carts, belong to can belong to multiple address books in the draft rather than having to be a single one. This was done just to mirror the way calendars and mailbox as work in the other jamout drafts. Just like in both of those, there's a capability that lets the server say the maximum amount is 1. So if you only split 1 on the server, you can still do that. I'm happy to jamap, but it gives the protocol that flexibility for service that wants support kind of"

So if you wanted to share different sets of cards with different people. You'd want different address books, which you can set sharing permissions on. be able to do that. is very trivial thing, but the data type has been renamed from card contact card to, again, match kind of the name in the data format. So with event calendars. We have the Jonas calendar format and the event type within that, and we call calendar event. Here, we have the JS contact format and the card typed within that corner contact card. just just just just consistency and hopefully a little bit clearer. And finally oh, not quite finally and on. mobile TV media, this is just if you have an embedded avatar or photo or something rather than getting back a big data URL, JM app will convert that to a JM app blog. The JM app server, that is. We'll convert it to JM app blog. and you get the blob ID back, and you can then fetch those in the standard way. just like with attachments and email so that you can load the data more efficiently. And a quicker, and same if you're creating them. The final change was just defining what properties the server should support for filtering and sorting if you're doing querying on the server. just so that was well defined. So with those in place, I think, again, it's actually fairly complete. We're waiting for Jess contact to be finalized before we push anything Further about As I said, there's really not much to it because it is just Jmap Synchronization protocol combined with the JS contact format.

But you can just say using email query, you can say, I want to find all messages which are encrypted. then do something with them. and So that's the part that is missing, which I will add. The other thing possibly is during decryption, one thing that a lot of email clients are doing is they are verifying whether Who the message is a like, is the sender of the message is matching the form address and stuff like this sent whether it's addressed to you. So I was wondering whether there is a need to possibly extract email addresses of recipients, for example, from encrypted a spineblob. and do a search for that. If you have opinions, let me know. Would that be likely to be different from the 2 addresses? I mean, is there additional utility from looking at the encrypted 2 addresses as compared with the the 2 addresses on the in the message, header?

So for, like, encryption, you know, you might want to select what algorithm to use and whether it's authenticated encryption or or non authenticated? Yeah. Possibly. And also the the header encryption you know, I think it might be good to allow a way to specify, like, which of those headers to encrypt because You know, you you might want to encrypt just the subject, for example, because it's user generated text, or or the subject in recipients, but not, you know, necessarily some of the other headers So with this, I think the way we've done this, it's basically referencing the Lam's document on header protect which tells you which recommends which one to encrypt So"

But there's, like, the injected headers and wrap headers, which think it recommends the injected hitters -- Yes. -- at this point. So I guess I don't know.

On the other hand, trying to get defaults, which are as sensible as possible. So you don't need to, well, it can amid the options. So Sure.

As I'm as we've been talking, I've been thinking about your first bullet and trying to come up in my head with the use case for wanting to for needing to know all the encrypted messages, and I can't imagine one. I imagine that you're ever gonna wanna say decrypt everything. or whatever and finding out finding all the encrypt messages in a mailbox can likely be very expensive. It seemed to me the would only -- No. It's just media type match. Well, think. Right. It depends what information you have And and the parameter, I cashed at the time and depends so it's going to depend on your mail store, I guess. Yeah. I think this operation is probably going to quick as opposed to asking to decrypt everything, which will be slow. Yeah. So what is the use case for needing to know all the encrypted messages would seem to me that you would decrypt messages as you encountered ones that you wanted to deal with. cost to decrypt -- You can show different and wouldn't have any symbol in a scan list. saying that it's encrypted. I also why why does the user care about it at that level? Okay. I actually we had a requirement that you want to flag all the messages which are not encrypted. or not as my sign, for example. to -- To the user because there should be an exception in some environments. Okay. I'll buy that. or you're looking for you you know that you're looking for something that you know is sensitive, and you can't remember who sent it to you."

I don't think it's Yeah. It's kind of it's not hard to implement. because you don't actually need to even look inside the payloads. You just need to verify it's encrypted as mine, basically. That's the only thing it does. but it's slightly more complicated than just matching content. Would would this be a mandatory capability for somebody implementing or an optional? I would just keep it as a part of the base just because I don't want to have too many options. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's just in terms of the the complexity of somebody in Yeah. I I agree with what Neil said off mic. Options suck. Yeah. if it's gonna be there, it ought to just be part of it. And, yep, ponder, ponder, Yeah.

And so we always want to import JEMF data, which we have a test data represented to server, for instance, and there we already implemented something like this a little bit.

Meaning, giving users a chance to export their mailbox and keep a copy by themselves. some migration scenarios when you do not do directly have a connection to social destination, which is a live connection, you could use that to persist temporarily the data on the disk. and you could reset format also trust that this will still work after some time without doing a proprietary thing.

So there is pure mail storage. and you're familiar with Mail Deer or Amdocs. I didn't actually find an RC for MELD here. I'm not sure if this is true, but doesn't to never see. Never see. Ah, okay. We'll we'll repeat that from Mike. Dan Bernstein just invented John Levin says, Thank you. But, of course, these these are common formats in a way if you just deal with mail. If you look at if you take a little bit of broader scope and look at, you know, seeing that go beyond mail, I think the most commonly used format also, for instance, when you look for this N run archive is usually PST files. which, of course, is a proprietary funded"

I think Also, other tools beyond Outlook partially try to implement it, but it's very difficult because format, I think, is not fully specified. Maybe I'm even wrong. But nevertheless, there are not so many implementations that libraries are available. On the similar matters, there NSF databases in domino notes, which is sort of similar. There's also things like Google takeouts. I'm not sure you're aware of that. with Google, you can request a dump of your Google account, and you basically get a big TAR file, which includes folders, which your mails, which I think is basically is a mail to your inbox. And then even your Google Maps, you have a whatever GPUX file in that folder and so on. I think they use iconendar and Recard for the context and calendars. So this is basically what's around, and obviously, as you see, this is not really satisfactory. for most cases. And so there's also not really much tools to board around. So for instance, for the Google takeout, it's not really easy to digest end users, I'm not aware of any tooling, which really helps an end user to deal with that file. I mean, of course, you can unzip it and then individually use each file. was a appropriate program, but it's, I think, not really use usable and I'm also not aware of any provider where you can just import that file again, and it will Magic keywork, Okay. Next slide, please. So how could this look like? So this is a little bit in progress. As I said, we have some internal implementation where we didn't really think a lot about just because we did just just use for test data. But discussions I had so sort like this might be used to probably generalize a little bit, listen to other requirements of people"

    "text": "And maybe coming up with a few suggestions, So one such suggestion could be yeah, you have a you have a a file which might be compressed or not. and, basically, which might separate folders by data types, by JEMF data types, So you might have a mail folder. a context folder, calendars folder, sift folder, You might think about separating blobs. for some reason because Fire might not grow too large and so on. You might think about, for instance, in the mail folder, even reuse maybe your inbox. question mark to probably get stay same with the standards there. And, yeah, for other data types, maybe just using the corresponding JEMAP responses as JSON files. And, of course, you would need some mechanism on top This is this is here's the index JSON, for instance, which tells you a little bit, okay, how to navigate within that file have some hidden information and so on. And, yeah, obviously, there is a lot of questions that would arise from that first run. So So it's basically what the state here is. So I'm happy to learn a little bit what's the feedback on that if it's worse you know, working on this further providing a real draft for review and so on. And, Neil, go for it. And, Neil, go for it. Nail Jenkins. Remember this time. I quite like the look of this as a just standardized takeout format. I think that's a useful thing to have. Mhmm. I would say it's only tangentially related to JMapp in that respect. Like, I'm not sure that should be part of the name. But, certainly, using JSContact, JS Calendar, and then, obviously, just a raw RC5322 email file. I think individual files for each one the folder structure seems fine. you need metadata to preserve keywords, in particular. I think if you wanted to do all full fidelity so you could explore and import and have everything back"

That could either be in one single index file at the top like you have or kind of individual sidecar. files, you know, if each email file also has a little metadata file with all the stuff in it. I be better to have a single one at the top, but either would work. But in in general, I quite like to look at that as a the format you could yeah. equities, equities, equities, We could probably Use that. k. Daryl is next. Daryl Miller, Microsoft. The PSD format is supposed to be part of our open specification promise. I pasted a link in the chat. If It was updated as of last year. If you find issues with it, reach out me. I'm in the exchange division. I can find to hunt down? 6. Great. Thank you. And See, Braun, I think is next on the on the queue. Hello? Is my sound alright? Sounds good. Awesome. Yes. So the fast mail backup format is not quite the same as this. It's much more specific to the internals of Cyrus at does a lot of stuff by the show 1 of individual mail messages that has deduplication in there. that uses it's a top file with a bunch of sim links and all sorts of smarts and deep raw index files in the binary internal representation. So it's certainly not the same as this, but this looks great. probably one thing to consider. is diffs. if you wanted to take a one of these archives and then have something that you applied on top of it to update to a new state. if you're looking at backups, you want incremental. So I think it's probably worth looking at how you might do incremental in terms of a reference to another file, maybe put a UID in each of these. And so you could reference apply this patch to this UID and have the index blank out files or something."

How did I do that? and so I've done it with a a blank file so you just have to remove all files with 0 size, but it if you unpack them one over the next Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. You're next. Hey, man. It's Ben Gearing. base my question is, like, I what are the trade offs as you between representing this is like a a comp an archive of a file system sub tree versus, like, a they part media type That contains a bunch of different Mime types that are, like, mail messages or tasks or something. Is that okay? representing this composition of many things as a file system sub tree archived versus just a multipart. message. rightly me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And maybe for stays a little bit, if I really understood correctly, because if you say, like, reverse represented this as a multipart object would mean I put everything in a giant on MIMEtree. Right? Well, we are I'm I'm seeing if this is if if this is an appropriate pharmored for that and can be efficiently navigated I mean, that could certainly be an option. I wonder if, for instance, the diff property, which Ron mentioned, would be so easy to realize here. because you might want also for our use case where we have to test data, for instance, we wanna easily access individual entities or individual contact calendars and so on. is probably also, like, from a user perspective, something, you know, you want to remove or move a certain contact or update a certain contact. And I wonder if if in the Mime case, it would require always pausing the whole tree,"

You said your name was Ben? Yeah. Then Okay. You you you weren't signed in on meet echo. It doesn't seem so please do that. Sure. And it's a reminder to everybody if you're not signed in on made echo. We we need it for attendance. Neil, you're next. Yeah. Neil Jenkins. just regarding that previous point, I think the reason not to have one massive kind of mine file is is available availability of existing tooling based I think, you know, there's a lot of existing tooling if you've got a standard compression archive from the, like, zip or something to then decompress that, grab out the bits you need easily. and pass them rather than having to pass one single massive file in order to which means in order to get the small bit of data you need. is you can have harder time finding good tuning for that and harder time doing it efficiently. Sure. But you still gotta pass it in the first time to divide it all stuff. So, yeah, I would I would say this kind of format is probably better. personally maybe when I was I was speaking, I was also syncing to to the mind I think one of the things is I mean, you might not even need to a single archive format here, but you could also decompress this. for some reason, then you could easier do our sync or something like that with individual files, which is probably not the also list. manual types. Yeah. I I wanted to to follow-up on on the same point that I think the archive formats a lot better because you can unpack multiple of them. I'm almost leaning towards the idea of having the index dotjson dispro. basically contain a reference to a uuid.json that actually describes So it just has has a list of of UIDs you know, and then dotfile.jsonfrenchone. That's indirection. And then if you have a diff file that refers back to a previous archive as well."

    "startTime": "00:50:04",
    "text": "you would then have the index file list all the UIDs.json files. that were required for this plus the previous versions of it. you know, might be certain if you had original file plus a 100 diffs, over a 100 days, you might wind up with Well, along, but still not that huge index.json. And then you would you could just unpack each of these archive files in turn, over the directory. And in theory, you then have a fully possible archive. and the the files that aren't referenced by any of the indexes can be removed safely and that would give you a backup format that you could you could incrementally apply using basically standard tools and still extract the data. which is what the goal that I was going for with the backup format that we use. you can just untar the file, and it's it's actually multiple TAS concatenate together, and then that whole string is it. You can unzip that into a directory read the indexes that come out of it, and that's enough to reconstruct all the message using obviously, you need to understand some of the format but you can use standard tools to get all the data out. There's nothing. really custom about it. John Levine at the mic. Yeah. John Levine. I think this is a good idea. I think we are this discussion is telling us it it's a little bit underbaked Mhmm. You know? And for example, like, your example of like, here's all the here's here's all the components we wanna I think if you if we go go through, figure out what the components are, figure out to what extent we want, to be able to rent randomly access them, then I think we can then then you can come back and well, here is a whole bunch of well known standard formats and pick you know, like, compressed tar is a perfectly fine format, but but the only way you can access is to stream through it. you know, and which is fine or maybe a Zip in which case you can you can speak to a particular file. But yeah. But once you figure out How how you wanna access this then then picking the container should be easy."

So we had 3 milestones We've got some old milestones here. Woah. Let's see. I'll I'll I'll start with the oldest ones who would submit SIV to IESG was supposedly December of last year. So we have an update for that, Ken? think it's not a last call. Oh, yeah. That's lost track of that. So, yeah, we're we're I we'll be submitting it to ISG in a month or so. Maybe Let's see. Jaymap sharing was December. forget who's who's Who's this, Sherry? Is that Neil? Yeah. That's just finished working group last call, we think. Okay.
