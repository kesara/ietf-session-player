John\u0027s um one of the things that\u0027s happened in this in this thing we\u0027ve gone over and over again on the low latency thing and I was thinking about back when I was dealing with voice over IP and the people saying ringing must start immediately you know when you pick up when you when you press the button it must not ringing within a small amount of time well guess what the systems don\u0027t work that way so what ended up happening is you\u0027re in starts ringing and pretending it\u0027s actually happening so there are other ways of solving the low latency problem rather than this multicast group thing especially when you\u0027re talking about well how many lights are you talking how many lights are you turning on with the flip of one switch again the message may be longer but there may actually be an authentication token for each one of the lights that you\u0027re sending and it\u0027s getting multicast out but you only care about your piece of it so I I understand why we keep going in this space but I\u0027m afraid unless you limit this protocol really specifically to these low latency low security things and figure out how to do it in the protocol it\u0027s going to end up with a field of use violation you and something else and that\u0027s really why I\u0027ve been complaining about this since the beginning so among Mike come back please I\u0027m gonna ask you a very specific question of course based upon what you have heard them said do you believe what is up there represents theirs what their security problem is all but the third to the last bullet okay so among the solutions so that\u0027s a new solutions interesting if the third to last bullet is that multicast is needed for efficiency so among the solutions that we had entertained on a million years I think this one is new just to change the user sort of behavior but the "
