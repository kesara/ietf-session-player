    "text": "very important to make sure we address the other two functions of Dave please thank you Dave Schoeneck Rob Eriksen so again I\u0027m going to ask my question for clarification because after you answered and said it was interface is that there will be more than one you went on to explain it as a singular interface so my question is this are we looking for one singular transport slice connectivity interface they can accurately represent all the different types of transport technologies that would be under it yes this is the intention I know the intention is to have a singular slice interface that represents all the different types of transport technology underneath yes as I go to the next slide I clarified that one the idea here is this interface similar to 3gpp our technology agnostic and other what how we are implementing let\u0027s say I give you an example I want to connect in the not very simple that 5g or 4G connectivity I want to connect in ODB to a core the connectivity it has I want to connect ran to call and with a specific isolate my latency should be less than 5 millisecond my bandwidth should be more than 10 megabit per second how this one is implemented in the network implementation or realization really doesn\u0027t change the fact that I want to connect this together I can connect at the end of the day I can connect grant to course through some routers in the middle using layer 3 VPN or I can simply use rocket VPLS connectivity of layer through lavatory the connectivity is the same implementation and realization is different and this is one of the item that in my opinion should hold to make sure for example we are separating the implementation from the definition of that and this is basically that abstraction layer that is created how I can implement the need for network maybe in the future there is a new way of implementation of light or layers 3 services in the network it should not change this interest and this is exactly the same for 3gpp those interfaces regardless of how is implemented who is the vendor and how detail is the implementation of random code they are very generic I want to connect of any creative personality for networkers life with some estimate focus was ID my SLA is this and very high level and this is basically aligned with them so can I interrupt for a second just to ask perhaps a naive question related to you also mention broadband forum as well earlier in your presentation so as I understand it 3gpp has said and has defined the ran slice interface and the "
