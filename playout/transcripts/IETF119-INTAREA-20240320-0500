Effectively, this is an upgrade from something that you may only know as a insecure be connect proxy or a SOX proxy, and learn that it supports, something better like a secure version of HTTP connect or a mask protocol, etcetera. You can also ask a proxy that you already know, about a configuration that it has to say, are you gonna let me talk to All domains are only some domains. And you can also have a mechanism to learn about proxies that are associated with the network so that when you are, are learning about, network's provisioning domain. You can understand the associated proxies in a secure manner. So here are just some diagrams of examples. You can have a HP proxy say that I support mask. Or you could say that, I support only proxying to these internal domains. Or the network can say, hey. I have this proxy that you could use of what you would be using otherwise. And that opens up all of these sorts of questions about do you trust it and you want to use it? But that that is mentioned briefly in the draft. So we had a discussion about this before, and I think we saw a good support for moving forward with this overall mechanism. One of the key pieces of feedback was, around, the the format for how we're communicating proxies being admittedly too naive here. He was just a list of URLs, Not only does that, have implications on being too, Unclear about what exactly, you were but it was also brought up that some use cases, like, learning about a proxy for media over quick may need a more extensibility and, more ability to communicate what this is for.

We essentially have, like, an array of sub dictionaries So you can say, here are my proxies, and then each one is described with its own JSON object, which can have multiple keys. And now we have an explicit protocol field, for which proxy protocol is is being used for this proxy. And then a proxy key that describes the location of the proxy, which is either a full URL, for all of the modern proxy types, or is just kind of the legacy hosting port that you would use for old HTTP connect. And SOX proxies. So this version of the draft defines some proxy protocol types, These are either essentially legacy types or they're reusing the HTTP upgrade tokens and protocol pseudo header fields that are used for the modern types of mask. And this is extensible, and you could have a registry and register more protocols in here. There are definitely open issues and things we wanna continue working on and having discussions with people who may use this. We need to look at how we correctly handle extensibility of adding new keys into these sub dictionaries to understand cases where There are essentially mandatory, keys, like, an extension such that you wanna make sure that older implementations, older clients that are learning about this particular proxy, don't use this unless they understand the new key because this is a mock specific proxy and can only be used in this one way. But also be able to have other proxies, that could add new keys, but still allow legacy clients to use them in some more generic way. So we need to work on that.

Maybe that's just something that becomes an optional key. And we also of had a comment asking for support for exclusion domains. I'm saying you can use you can reach anything over this proxy other than these domains. I think that's a very nice feature that would allow it to have, more parity with and ability to replace pack files, And I think there should be some discussion about where exactly that should be? Should that be at the parent PVD level or within a specific, proxy sub dictionary. But I I was I think these are all things that are worth considering potentially, you know, after an adoption and, have a broader community review of what would be most useful. People to use. Do you also wanna call out some of the relationship with what I would call legacy proxy discovery mechanisms, and the document does touch on this how this is, related to things like pack files and WPAAD. Which have been common techniques, that has Been provisioning proxies for many, many years now. But those don't support modern and secure proxy types. And, of the provisioning, at least from the from the perspective of client, not very secure or something that we want to trust going forward. So just on this point, You know, p the PVD approach does allow taking any proxy that you've learned through one of these mechanisms and upgrading it into, a proxy configuration that can now have new protocol type So that is one touchpoint of a relationship.

I realized that I didn't Make any background slides, so I'm just gonna sit on the title slide for a little while. I've been so deep in this topic for that, you know, I forgot that other people, like, might not even know what the protocol is. So, What is what is pro? One of the motivations for probe is, looking at the status of the network in these deployments where A router might not have a unique IP address assigned to every interface. Or in fact, a router may not have a unique IP address. In your Do within the domain. To be able to use ping to check on liveness. And so, So probe has kind of 2 modes that you can run it in."

So you can You can address a packet to the router and say, hey, router, you know, how's your ethernet to interface doing. Is it up? Does it have V4 and V6 connect, you know, addresses assigned to it? And, another mode that you can run it in is called the remote mode. Where you can it's kind of a query of the ARPA or neighbor discovery cache of the router. You're saying, hey, do you have an do you have this entry in your neighbor's discovery test? And what's state is it in? You know, is it in delay or, like, failed or Working. Right? So So for the 1, you can kind of look at your own system and say, this is how I think it's working And, For the other, you say, this is a peer that I know that he has. And is he likely to be able to talk to his peer? You know, a routing peer or whatever. So that's the, that's the basis of the protocol. It was published As Rfc 8335. And, I decided to implement it. And so, I tried to understand it from the RFC. And then what I was observing kind of didn't match what I thought I was reading in the RFC. And, so that's where We start getting into the the the details of, of what these what these packets are. These packets use the, RFC 4884 extension mechanism for ICMP And so that packet format has kind of a A pack, a header, and a check sum, and then arbitrary objects after that. And the request information is stored in in one of these"

And so it only worked against a responder that I found doesn't check the extension checks. So So, I was and it so, you know, I I started collecting these observations and saying, gee, you know, these are things that maybe should be clarified in the spec so that when people go to implement these things, they everybody does it the same way. Another really interesting aspect of the spec. Was that, The They they, echo the data that they received But the only place of the spec Mention's echo is in the name of the ICMP type. The ICMP type is ICMP extended echo. But, There's no place in the spec where it says copy the data from the received packet to the sent packet. And then There's another aspect of this RSC 4884 ICMP extension. Where That RFC says that the extension header is followed by 1 or more Extension objects, and those objects are formatted in this way. And, The 2 of the implementations Just added extra information after it just like the pink client does, you know, some some data to To test if all the bites are getting through. But my read of the specs said that that wasn't allowed. So, So that was what the responders Did, Then we have clients. How did the clients behave? So as I mentioned,"

And then, of course, there's relying on that extra data The The traditional ping program you sticks a time stamp into the packet. And relies on that being returns to it to measure the RTT. But again, the spec doesn't really talk about echo other than in the name. And then there's, you know, it's one of these things where the option is supposed to be full of 4 bytes, but the interface name might not be a multiple of 4 bytes. You add padding, and then You know, is the length of the interface name object that it contains patney+3 patting bytes. Is that length 5 or length 8 and you know, that's something that Turns out was being done differently by different Clients, And then a final topic that came up as I was investigating this was How how can a user interpret the result of his probe request. So you know, this is a nice client that prints out all the information that it got. Right? And, and it princident a very familiar form. This is, you know, basically helping outputs its data. So is this good or bad? Right. If this was a ping, The answer is this is good. But it turns out, There's hidden in there. There's active equals 0. Ipv4 equals 0. Ipv6 equals 0. It's like if you were expecting that this link was up Then this is a bad response. So the that's kind of a a a UI issue, but, It's, it's it's something that's important to be able to you know, make the tool usable for people."

So We don't need to be desperate about it here, but basically, I I I tried to cover each of those areas, that the, that I thought the spec was lacking And, And Also, to address the, the human readability aspect of the messages I added a section to the appendix. It's already non normative but, It talks about If you're going to print, you know, if the if the response came with an error message, Just print the error message. Don't print the rest of the fields because the error means that the rest of the fields don't matter. And then know, if The If you're querying a remote interface, Don't print the fields. That are relevant only to the local interface. That's just clutter in the UI, and that's gonna confuse user. The important part is the remote interface state. And so and then the a suggestion to print You know, there are these 3 bits. Is the interface active? Does it have V4 and doesn't have V6? And the suggestion is kind of to rather than say you know, I'm gonna print out false false true you know, to make something nicer than that. Interface is not active or interface is active and has before on it. You know, rather than just seeing v 4 equals 0. V 6 equals 1. So, finally, Here's a bunch of stuff that I've done.

So You know, unlike a regular system where you would expect the response to be relatively stable with this synthetic response generator, you get 1 of each response. In sequence.

And so, We use, before wraps with V Six next hops in order to 2 Do routing based on Using the 6 addresses of neighbors instead of V4, And then, So in that in the in the easy to imagine scenario there, each router does have a global unique IPP 4 address. So you say, oh, you know, how do I address a router you, you know, you know when its address is. But, there's there's a Kind of more extreme scenario here Where the address shortage is so severe or just the overhead of making allocations is is problematic enough. That maybe you have a network design where here's your spine and here's your leaf and whatever and they each have an address. But then you take that design and you replicate it in another data center without changing the the addresses. You know, you can do all your network management, etcetera, over ipd6. So that part doesn't matter. And within a data center, you can get a trace route that goes you can identify, you know, leaf's fine.

Or the name or the IAF index. And, And they can tell you information about the incoming interface and the outgoing interface. But this doesn't really necessarily help you identify the router still. And the address, is, it has to be the same address family as the packet that you're responding to, so you can't say I have here's the V Six address of this interface. I did assign a global V Six gruss, to this interface, and I will give you that information. So so that that doesn't really fit the problem. So Right. That There there may not be an address that you can put into the packet. And, and if you just if from the central system, when you are looking up an address. When you get an address back, you it requires another lookup to figure out what the no name is.

Personal let's go to the background source address spoofing has led to the spread of network attacks and other security incidents. And has become one of the most important of the current internet. As shown in the figure, if host a, sit, send sends a package to see with source address e, then there is no problem. However, host the agents both the source address of the packet. Wants to send to see to be Then I'm making the thing could that be has send as a package. 2 is So there in this case, that there will be a problem for this issue, the IPF establish the savvy working group. In July, 2008, to adjust this issue. Its goal is to ensure, that hosts attached to the same Sorry. The the Yeah. In this in this slide, this goal is to ensure that hosts attached to the SIM IP link cannot spoof each other's IP addresses without disrupting let's teammates chatty. Next please. To enable network operators to deploy find green the IP source address validation without dependency. Supportive functionality, hosts The 7 method was designed to pretty Puritynetwork based. A service solution, enforces the host's use of legitimate ID source addresses according to the following 3 step model."

A third, enforce that's the IP source address in the package. Match the bending anchors 2 weeks they were bound. Next, please. There are various ethnic anchors that can be used. For example, actually, in extended a unique identifier switch ports and and and so on the virus bandwidth anchors differs significantly, in the security as they provide. For example, a triple e extended unique identifier failed to render us secure badly anchor because they can be spoofed with little effort currently, the commonly used the ones are a switch ports, the savvy working group has developed, RFCs for a variety of scenarios.

This is a high level overview of CVWLANs, CV devices in this case, APs, access points, and access controllers. They first listen for address assignments. Established Bandies. And then validates the source address of the packets. The bendy entries are also synchronized and confirmed in the between APs and ACs. And the between ACs and ACs. Taking into accounts, that's as a user, maybe mobile, next, please. We use MAC addresses has been the anchors in Savi wireless LAN but they must be, secured, using mechanisms, mechanisms such as ish02. 11i or other mechanisms, if the MAC address is unprotected, attacker can spoof the source, MAC address to pass validation successfully. And next, please, we have designed to data structures. The first one is IP Mac, mapping table, And the second one is MAC IP mapping table. The IP maximum table maps an IP address MAC address.

For example, access, access points or, access controllers. A synchronization mechanism must be used between these two tables to ensure the consistency of the bandings. Next, please. We we consider, 3 scenarios for banding, Christian. The first one is static. Or the static IP MAC address pairs, configured into the IP MAC matching table with the mechanism enabled. A second DHCP, the service, devices, device snooped snopes the DHCP address assignment process between the attached attach the host the DHCP server. For slack, the Savi device snopes duplicate address detection procedure or adjust the resolutions procedure between attached to hosts and neighbors. Next, please.

Are you gonna take questions in the middle or at the end? Both both are okay. Also, it's okay. Okay. So We have to learn. So in the queue, I don't know if your question pertains to this. At the end? Okay. Thanks. So please continue. Okay. Next, please. This slide shows the process of performance your, sub suggest validation first, way, extract the IPS source address and the Mac address runs a free And then we we we will look at, the, MAC addresses a MAC address in the IP Mac mapping table in the Mac IP mapping table and check if the Mac IP pair exists if the exists, we will we will the the static device will, for worst package, If not, then we will look at the IP address in the IP Mac mapping table a check if the IP address exists. If not, we will drop the packet at UBS, we will, UBS, we will check the app MAC addressing the entry is the same as in the These are free.

What was the method of synchronization between says can be determined independently Next, please. We also consider, 2 deployment scenarios The first one is synchronize the wireless LAN And then the second one is autonomous a wireless LAN. Next, please. For this first scenario, centralized, wireless LAN we consider 2 cases. The first one is AP filtering. In this case, AC maintains IP maximum action table, and AP maintains MAC IP matching table and performs perform address smoking. Next police. The second one is the AC filtering. AC maintains both Mac IP and the IP mapping map pin tables it performs post address snooping and packet filtering. All the packets will be forwarded to the AC firstly. Next, please.

In various lang, random MAC addresses are mainly used for discovering wireless networks and accessing networks and communication. For wireless network discovery, a a host to use it properly, proper proper request for him to discover virus, wireless networks. This does not, affect the establishment of savvy and the anchors. Second case is network access out of communication, random MAC addresses are used to send and receive packets. In s02dot Level I wireless networks. The key used for communication is tied to the mac address, And there's a random MAC address. It's a dress that's not changed during communication you're in the same various network Is there a random MAC address does not change, when you as a wireless network to ensure roaming experience. If the, MAC address changes the accessories to be re rechecked. In summary, the anchor of Savi Bandin is stable during 1 access. There's a solid function will work well. Next, please. Next steps.

    "text": "Yes. Thanks. We have people in the queue. So let's start with Lorenzo. Yeah. So, I noticed that, you know, the draft mentions that, slack addresses are bindings are populated by snooping dad. That's an approach that people often think of first, but it doesn't work very well because that is only one packet at the beginning of the exchange, and it can be frequently dropped. Additionally, if you just snooped that, you have no way of expiring the address. Because you don't know how long it's last and how long the host is there for. So snooping that is not a workable way of doing this. Is, however, documented in in, 6620 FCFS Savvy, So, maybe you should just use that, which is already an RFC. Okay. Yeah. mean, I another thing that you that we might wanna mention is that, is a draft in DHT, which is I guess I guess on its way to ISG now, right now, where there is a, d2v6 address registration packet. You could consider using that. To build state as well. That means you only have to look at one protocol. But but but No. No. FCFA. In any case, you'll have to figure out something out for Yeah. for Slack. Oh, thanks. We will consider your, comments we will refine the refine the draft in the next version. Okay. K. Thanks. Next, I put myself in the queue. I I have a question. No. Sure, Pat. So moving to slide just because you're talking about the MAC address around the migration and the fact that, Think that It's not necessarily the case all the time. Besides, and made it to 11. Right now, there are, multiple active discussions in native to live in B8 and BI regarding how to randomize the MAC address"

So, just a word of advice as a lot of these assumptions are currently being changed in NATO to 11. Regarding the use of random MAC addresses or you may want to consider that too. Okay. Thanks. It's We will consider this issue. Okay. Yen? Jen and Kala, I I it Not like probably problem of, like, not directly related to your draft. Maybe it's kind of problem with original Dgcp service draft, but the HCP would a a DSUV 6 can allow you to get a prefix delegate. Slash 60 for whatever. Right? It could be a lot of addresses. So I assume that any service solution should also snoop DHCPVC's delegation exchanges, and allow all those addresses. So you might want to put not just IP addresses, but the prefixes. For APV 6 into your table. Because otherwise, like, previous delegation would not work with all devices. Okay. Thank you we ignore this issue, and we will consider the the prefix issue the next person. Thanks. So, Eric, To be honest, you know, the the the draft, but I wonder what's the difference with ROC 6620 and the others we're already doing something very, very similar And be honest, right, I work for Cisco and now don't want to make an advertisement, but this technique has been used for more than 10 years now. If I understood your proposed actor, Maybe it goes beyond, but it would be nice to explain what you are going beyond the existing solutions. Okay. Thank you."

It wasn't clear to me from the presentation. What needs to be standardized by the IETF. This sounds like a reasonable product feature suggestion. In which case, some access point maker can just to ship this feature. Snoop on the neighbor discovery. And enforce the security IETF standardization is needed when different devices need to communicate. And I didn't see anything here of a request for Android should change to do this or iOS should change to do this or Windows should change to do this. I it seems like this draft has been around since April 2011. So it's thirteen years old now. And It seems like this would be a fine thing for a vendor to ship. I'm just not understanding what the request of the IETF is for this. Currently, the the savvy solutions RFs, standardized in the does not address this, the issue in the wireless lens So we we can hear just then, try trying to standardize, this this draft. And as for the, as as a study working group has been con concluded So, we come here to trying to to stand standardize this, this strat. I'll let Lorenzo speak next, but If a vendor wants to ship a product, they don't need IETF permission to do that. Right? I don't think the Saudi working group being closed. Is a problem for vendors that want to ship products. Thanks."

    "text": "Lorenzo. Yeah. I mean, I think, this kind of is solved in existing savvy solutions, in particular, you know, if you take if you take DSUV 6 savvy, for DSU V Six and you know, FCFS savvy for a Slack, or if you just use FCFS savvy for everything, That basically uses the MAC address as the binding marker, which is basically what you're doing here. I I'm not sure that this is actually sort of not solved. Right. Right. And I'm not sure what's different, because Yes. This draft mentions that if you have 802 dot eleven eye then the MAC address is secure, but, you know, the FCFS have you already uses the MAC address as a binding error. So I think that's the same. Existing standardized RFCs the MAC address, although the MAC MAC address usually in the vendor anchor, but they or, they they are combined with use the waste with, switch ports So more use case, they are more used in the why why are the networks? So we consider this issue Jean in the wireless networks. Various lens. On. We we can commute. We can talk about this issue in the mailing list. Okay? Alright. Thank you very much. Lynn? Thank you. I see no one else in the queue. Any other questions or Business, Alright. So Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you, Josh, for the notes. Hold on. I I just raise my hand. Yes.
