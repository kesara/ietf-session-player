So the first one is about resource preservation. So this is very much relevant to the kind of network. that has constraints such as power, storage, etcetera. So from network point of view, We will have that's linked activation, deactivation, our node that's On and off, based on a schedule. The second category is about operation, operating efficiency. So this is a network that operates result. time varying cost. And so Also, to a network, will will This will involve schedule a link link cost based on time. The 3rd category is about mobile devices. This is the all the use cases, all that's cost network topology changes or any attribute changes because of motion or mobility. So this may from network point of view, we may have link on and off pass attribute, bandwidth change, etcetera. on neighbor changes. So after we publish Version 01 before ATF."

So a typical example is University Campers. We have the traffic that network traffic all goes to classrooms, library in the morning and go back to domes out of campus in Amy. So there is a draft in TBR on this one. So I think at least from the mailing list discussion, we agree this should be added to the use case document and we will work with that draft also on this one. and Another comment is about satellite. So the suggestion which is we should include include satellite not just liasetlight. something maybe like a We we got meal, all Jill, and our interconstellation. communication. So to me, you know, if if the movement of the satellite or the impact to the network can be describe using a schedule.

We should actually bring in the the predictability of the traffic. As you mentioned, the example. Your first example, for example, the campus traffic, for example. It's, like, cools off and goes somewhere else that, you know, doing doing night time.

One more quick note. it's quite possible that we have to consider the fact that, you know, once we are predicting something, and that prediction doesn't come true, then what we have to do. That might as well be parts of the use cases if you wanna mention in death. So your for example, the the the the the schedule is is telling me that a link, for example, Sethalo is gonna come up. within this time slot. And then but for for it was easy now that that link would not come up. Now what happens is that, especially in the satellite case, this this thing will go around the earth And we have to sort of have a mechanism in place it back also. This is different from what we have in the terrestrial network. when the the the the lead state protocol basically will just work that way. here, we have predicted that something will happen. it didn't happen, and now we have to put a mech mechanism together to back back it off. you want, I can actually -- I I guess we need to discuss more about this. I personally, I don't think if you tell me a No. If I'm a router, you tell me a fake schedule. How am I supposed to know that fake? No. It's not fake. It's just like, for example, Alia is going to go around the earth, and then I'll and be a bit we have an element act that tells you how time we start that app. The interface in node 1 and node 2 is gonna come up. And now something hits the the laser beam or the the radio of the of the satellite a on that interface and bring it down. Now, everybody has predicted no time of the clock. Everyone basically went in and moved their prediction algorithm 1 spot further and they are assuming that interface is up. Right? So now that interface is not that prediction is no longer valid. So we have to create a mechanism to back off that prediction. from everybody. Okay. see a point. Thank you. If you want, I can actually I have I have the documentation for you.

Like, Why do you think the unplanned topology changes should not be covered in TBR? And if so, where do you propose it should be covered? Why is it different from plan to policy changes because these are probably very frequently that these happen as well. So TVRs charterer, we are talking about plant, network topology change, our network attribute change based on a schedule. So I client topology change.

Even link failure or no failure, all handled by FRR today, and that's not within the charter of TBR. it should be you're thinking it should completely be addressed by FRR and TBI still is now here. Well, just with Sharehead on, it the the the a scoping perspective, TBR's initial charter was to focus on planned.

But I don't know what a time variant load a's. if it is something different, then sure. Yeah. Let's make we can identify that it is something different. But I I I suppose this underlines my concern that I think this might be the wrong approach to start a classification of notes. rather than looking at how existing notes which are running existing routing protocols could be augmented to understand that there is some time variance in the decisions that they are making. but but I could consider scenarios where being a time variant node, is simply a configuration option. and it might change over time itself.

I so I I think I do under where you're coming from is is to some way to to classify a node as being subject to time or being Tiberian Sensitive, but I would suggest that that property itself is time variant. I could have a I could have a note my mobile phone I can plug it into the power, and it's, therefore, got a sustainable regular apparently, power supply or I could remove the power supply, and then it becomes battery powered and could, in some ways, be you know, time variant.

There's still a lot of DVDs in here and still a lot of things that need to be discussed and worked out. But we feel that it's a a good starting point. And what this is doing is it's it's trying to achieve the charter item of documenting basic definitions and requirements of what what TBR means. So the use cases are explaining What are the situations that exist And this document is supposed to be taking a stab at identifying nomenclature and explaining what the systems that deal with those use cases Should shall and may do. So it's a combination. It's it's not a augmentation of an existing protocol. It's explaining what these protocols should and should not do. and the goal is linked back eventually to the use case draft, draft, to point out specific purposes and rationale for why these things are refinements of TBR Systems."

    "text": "Next slide, please. So we give a definition a very general purpose definition of what what a time variant network is And one relation to what we were just talking about is the way that this, view of things sees the world is that It's the network itself, which is time variant, not an individual element of the network. We use terminology from existing modeling documents in the IETF so that we know what a note is, what a link is, but interaction point. I think it's called is but it's the network itself that's time variant. and and The reason for this is that either sort of what we were just talking about too is that Either nodes in the network systems that operate a on in the network or talked about the network Either they do understand time variance or they don't. So Having a a node in the network, that doesn't change state over time, doesn't affect the fact that the management to the network or the length of the network aspects of the network itself can change over time. And there's a lot of different things that possibly could change within a time varying network Some of these are attributes of nodes. Some of these are attributes of links. And what we're trying to do here is capture some some some basic terminology and some basic Notion of how these can be modeled. And then The one thing that is I don't believe it's a specific slide out of here, but it is important to focus on and important to have discussion about because It affects understanding of of how these systems are are operating. it's documented in the draft currently but it's not"

And any system that models this kind of thing or any system that has to deal with this kind of thing, has to consider both of those things as independent but related aspects. And in the past, management protocols routing protocols and these things, deal with changes in Waffle of Time Time because they have to. If you enable an interface or enable a link, And like we were saying earlier, the link doesn't come up, at That's just a fact of life. That's things changing over war, 4th time, But what we're trying to do with these requirements and with TBR generally is to describe how things change n, schedule time, And, ideally, scheduled time would play out, exactly as we planned it in wall clock time, But in fact, there can be differences. but it is important to distinguish between between These two Completely separate timelines of activity, And when you're talking about things changing over time, It's also important to be a little bit more clear whether you're talking about things changing over a scheduled timeline, or things changing over work or timeline. Next slide, please. So the scope of this document is we're starting with The use cases is a basis for why is any of this happening. And then we're discussing What can be modeled, What are the different aspects of models generally of a network and how schedules can fit into these things. The next group of items here, are some terms that are being defined in this document. These terms are a first go at putting concrete definitions to them,"

    "text": "So a welcome feedback about these details, about how they're written now, about if anything's missing or if anything is confusing, We want these terms to be as clear and understandable as possible. And some of these things have major effects on the capability of a time variant system. So things like time precision of the model itself, greatly affect how that model can operate in the sense that your model operates on the time precision of 1 hour, then you your Wall clock time certainly is going to evolve as as reality does, but your scheduled time is then constrained it can only evolve in 1 hour increments. and maybe in certain applications that's sufficient, and maybe in other applications that's wildly in a insufficient. but these are aspects of models These are not this this part of the document are not requirements on models, but they are requirements on what models must consider About time variance. Periodicity is another big one. There are existing systems that model time variants but don't include a notion of periodicity and that simplifies things a lot, but it also limits things a lot. So going back to what are these requirements really we are not going to require that a TBR model includes something like periodicity, but that that these models must consider periodicity because going back to the difference between schedule timeline and wall clock timeline, in wall clock timeline, as we were talking about earlier with orbital systems and with title systems, systems, Things do change periodically. your model might not have a notion of periodicity intrinsic to it, But the thing you are trying to model does have a notice in curiosity."

But, again, just a consideration of a system that deals with scheduled time should at least address these concerns. And interpolation is is related to continuity in the sense that some things deal well with discrete changes in state but some systems again, going back to the scheduled time versus wall clock time, if the real system being modeled varies more slowly and more continuously A discrete changed model might capture that well, in other circumstances, it might not capture it well. So continuity, interpolation, and then time precision, like I was mentioning before, all play a factor in how well cannomodel capture the nuances of the real system. And then lastly, the terminology of nodes, links, and the attributes of those those things are taken from an existing document and just to call it out here because I was Trying to Call this. This is the RFC 8345 the the data model for network topologies. And the the goal here is to hopefully build on what's already"

When we talk about the descriptions of these definitions, temporality, time variability, time horizons, and so on. is it the intent of this document to to make them relative definitions to understand the requirements or is the intent to make these the the normative definitions of these terms for the TBR working group at large. the goal would be that these are definitions for the terms that other Specifications would not need to reuse. that doesn't mean that everybody has to agree on them. But if you say a term and you cite this document, you don't have to reexplain all of the world around what that term means. And I do agree with that. One of our charter items is to make definitions of terms common to what we are doing here. And so putting that as part of the requirements document is is a reasonable place to put it as opposed to a separate document. and people would point here to to understand those terms. type it. Thank you. Thank you. So right now, we have really one illustrative example of a very complex time variant model, and that is that the FAAAs, air analytical information exchange model and This is highly complex, but also highly expressive. This represents a kind of a A reference of how difficult, A model can be to try to capture a lot of nuance from reality. this is not intended to be a, an example that we would adhered to for TBR models, but it's intended as a a point of reference to say how complex something might be"
  },

    "startTime": "00:44:01",
    "text": "but also how expressive something might be. The intent of probably how TBR models are going to eventually evolve, is gonna be considerably simpler than this. And considerably, more narrow in terms of time horizon. That was one thing that was mentioned in the last slide in terms of terminology, is that A model could attempt to to handle the time horizon of many years but that adds a lot of complexity, and that adds also a lot of situations where your schedule timeline starts to deviate wildly from your wall clock timeline, because you don't necessarily know what's gonna happen in in multiple years. but you can have a model that is limited in time to a few days, a few months and aty maybe achieve better adherence to reality. So Also, for examples, there are some existing models come from the the delay to our networking domain, they are, in some cases, less complex, and less expressive, We don't have 1 model to rule everything, So but we still would like to point at some existing models to use as Again, examples of what what does an existing system look like? And how does it fit into on these set of aspects that are defined in this document. So it's a an open call to say, Are there existing models, that our TV are like enough that we could point to And say okay. what does this model look like when viewed through the lens of of these aspects that we're defining this document.

You don't have to have certain kinds of security but you have to explain what it is and how it fits in. And the goal here is to do the same thing. We're explaining what things a model should say, of itself, so that somebody can understand what it's doing and what it's not doing. And then The other main area that's not in scope is how an implementation shop rate And so this is not talking about Where does this information come from? it doesn't talk about how does the information get distributed among a network, and it doesn't talk about how It doesn't talked about specific Lee, how a model can be implemented in a device. But some of the aspects such as time time horizons and time grain time precision, affect, how a device could execute a time frame schedule. because if a schedule has a very fine grained precision to the time in the scheduled timeline, but the devices implementing it have very coarse green clocks then that's something that's probably not going to have very well in practice.

The reason for distinguishing those terms is is to talk about how things change and and when you're saying a thing is changing, It's very important to distinguish. Do you mean it's changing in the schedule, or do you mean it's changing in reality because of they flipped a switch was flipped or a link was down. Right. I think I have I have to think about that. Would you see there say there'd be in instances, where a schedule change based on dynamically. Yes. And and there's some discussion in talking about this. But there's there's a notion that a Model has state. and the schedule is inside that model state. the model state has a full schedule it it it adheres to whatever the model, you know, the horizon, this the granularity. The model has a state within it That state of the model actually changes over wall clock time. the expectation, and it should be something that is required of TVR Systems is is You don't make a schedule once in a lifetime and you're forced to stick with that schedule, it that it's not already, but it ought to be a requirement of a TVR model that it is allowed to change over wall clock time. Okay. The schedule should be allowed to change. You shouldn't be -- It should be allowed to change, but that would take a re configuration. Oh, okay. Okay. Exactly. And that's -- Because because that take if if it doesn't, that takes away the predictability of Exactly. If I had a system that I could configure one time ever and if I ever wanted to change it, just tear the system down and rebuild it. that would be a nightmare. Right?

And the concept is that 8 Schedule augmented model, should have should have the same things being modeled as the non augmented model, but it's it's up to the detailed implementation, the detailed specification to say, these things are allowed to change based on a schedule. These things are not allowed to change. And one thing that is a carryover from the the accent model that is useful to have in this kind of thing is that identities of things, should not change over time. but but other attributes of things should be allowed to change. the accent model, anything and everything besides the identity can change over time. but in a realistic TBR network model, it's probably gonna be restricted to specific things But what those things are is up to the individual model. you said something earlier when you were presenting about commonality. And when we get to commonality, it's probably pretty good to have common units and common degrees of precision, common ways of expressing, in other work in this an IETF.

So if it's you know, a link speed that has been measured in you you choose the the lower link speed to work with And if it's latency, you would choose the larger latency to work with. So, you know, examining the distributed case a little further, you know, one possible thing that would to be done with this data is that existing IGP metrics could be populated with values from the availability list. So meaning that No. When when a link comes up, the router could consult the availability of this to see if there is an entry there with matching a matching link and time. And if so, borrow values from the attributes there to fill in its metrics. There is also some work being done on IGGBmetrics, with time constraints built into them. And you decided to go that way, if then I think it'd be a very direct transcription of you know, availability data into that. metric. Next. Alright.

I I think addressing your point about the difference between Bubble protocol bips and CLA attributes, I I almost wonder whether those are 2 2 models because what your modeling link last day, what your modeling topological information, I'd be interested to see whether it it makes more sense splitting it, in some way, maybe within one model with 2, separate trees or I'll I'll read and provide feedback and help if you want. I think we should keep this in mind, but I kinda waiting for the the group of others to I think I think waiting is a really good idea. Right. Actually, being involved at the same time by this yesterday, I said, you know, let's make sure that my use case is still, you know, in the merge. or not my use case. Alright. you very much."

    "text": "The next presenter is for Alto. Hello, everyone. This is Luis Contreras from Telefonica. I represent the the the well, this idea of using auto posting TBR information. So next please. So as a sort of background, just reminding the presentation that I did in in Yokohama. So the idea is to leverage an Alto to to expose the anticipated changes in the topology. Alto has a feature called cost calendar that allows to present different topologies. So in such a way that we can present the present apology, and plan schedule changes in the in the topology in the future. So this leveraging in auto enables the an off path mechanism for exposing the the planned technological changes. And, also, something interesting from Fernando is the the possibility that consumed by applications. So in such a way that those changes that are predicted predictable can be consumed by applications. So the applications be aware of potential changes in in the network. on the right side or on the your left side. Sorry. You can see a illustrative architecture, so there could be others that was just set as illustration purposes. on how to leverage on on Alto for exposing the information. essentially, what the figure says now is that the information could be collected either from an network controller. could another possibility maybe to leverage in things like network digital twin and so on so far? the fact is that actually Alto will retrieve the current view of the topology plus, possibility of incorporating the plan or schedule changes in in our electropology. you know, in I mean, the the topological changes the cost calendar functionality. Next, please."

    "text": "the changes from the previous version in the documents was essentially I have a a little bit more on the different strategies for advertising the predictive to to political changes. Essentially, where are they driving two mechanisms by means of enable controller as as the element that is able to schedule the changes and using out of our exposing those changes to to applications basically the second case would be, but advertising these changes to routing protocol So both of them could be potential mechanisms of Yeah. the opposite set of potential strategies, let's say, of advertising these changes. Also, we are thinking, yeah, thinking now. specifically your alto we have this kind of better. what would be the 2 different ways of retrieving the information as said, thinking on Alto. one case could be directly interacting with the network controller. So then I will control everything in the element that calculates the the different changes due to the plan topological change, and then pass this information to Alto. second mechanism will be that that will integrate directly with routing mechanisms that are conveying this information of the changes. So as to parse the the that messages, incorporate those changes into the logic of Alto for later on posting these two applications. Next, please. So the advantages of of the proposed approach are are the following. So by leveraging Erato, it's possible to upload the processing of the changes the network elements. So the network elements will not necessarily need to to process all the changes. especially if we follow the this idea of being the network controller the one calculating the potential changes. So we offload these this processing for the regular lemons will leave this processing either to the network controller or the auto dependent depending on where we put could put the logic of the calculation of the changes."

  {
    "startTime": "01:34:02",
    "text": "also because of that, I mean, because not Because processing, let's say, because of loading the processing of the of the changes, We also avoid unnecessary and desirable cascading or propagation effect in the sense. that whatever change that could be incorporated to the protein protocol, and this I mean, those changes are as long as they are being propagated among the different routers. can produce new changes in the routers that are receiving the the schedule, the the schedule change. So somehow generating new changes and and probably increasing the time of convergence the overall view of of the resulting do body after the a desired change. A second benefit that the that that we see with this approach is the following as well. So the the the network elements are good in in pro propagating information about changes of the actual or current adjustancies and and notes. So a a network node will be aware of what is connected to it, what is attached to it, and then can propagate this change. But is not so good for reciprocated changes of network elements that are not yet the system. for that, we will need probably to leverage in our network controller. that could instruct or or, yeah, basically, instruct the node. hey, there will be a new node here or that you will have a new adjacency between these node that note, So Altofit well in in Alto plus the network controller fits well in in in this idea of propagating changes due to new elements that will appear in the the not the ones that are present, but new ones that will be the network. And finally, as said before, the also, the idea that by following, let's say, this this approach, also, we can made the applications being aware of the change, the topological changes that will happen in the network. So that the applications will not have data tax to the routing information."

    "text": "But the by by using ATLAS safety, they come received the topological changes, and then take some actions here in advance. to those the political changes. Okay? So next, please. So the next steps, we would like to call a feedback from working group. also thinking on the this feature, the cost calendar feature, from Alto. The idea will be to assess if the parameterization of the of the models that the ones that we have just seen. the time of discussing the scheduling. so how compatible with the parameterization that Delta is considering the cost calendar. So there there is a calendarization parameter how to how how often to present changes and so on so far. So they will be able to assess are somehow compatible both both both ways. You know? Because thinking in the in the case that Alto could consume as well. these these schedules from the routing protocols. Then if perceived as necessary, Also, probably, we could add some scenarios that could may be better argument, the the fact that the applications can leverage on this information and that would be official for the for the applications. We can think in media delivery streaming session recess, whatever the kind of service that could be benefited or the fact of knowing in advance schedule changes. So they the the application can take decision of moving flows from one part of the network to another part about the initials, about the problems. And then if necessary to refine or or improve the architectural figure that they saw at the beginning, because it was just for illustration purposes, but probably we can go, let's say, into more sales and jump providing better discretion of of of of the case. So with that, I finish or any comment or feedback is more than welcome. Thank you. Should we consider using NetComm for distribution? net contributing. Yeah. Net Net Cox. Yep. Well, you mean for configuring Alto?"

I also have a question, chair hat off of, but we just we talked a little bit about contact graph. and a model for we would talk about future contacts I I I Is is Alto what is the overlap or the relationship between contact graph as an approach, and Alto as an approach for predicted and scheduled links. Well, I'm not too much familiar with the like, contact graph Yeah. I need to to read more about that so they don't have an answer. But at the end, well, without that, we can also post the the changes in front enough for them for So, naturally, this is the essence of the contact stuff, but I I need to become more familiar with that. Maybe what I can do is to post post in the middle list once they're in the draft of a week. and and comment about the differences or synergies. That that would be appreciated. Okay. Stop to mark.

    "text": "So the motivation of this structure is 2 cushion for TVR routing implementation. And we discussed 3 implementation modes in the draft. One is centralized mode. and the other 2 is distributed mode. Next please. So let's take this figure for example, the variable node means that The node has Scheduler, link, or cost changes. So the number of node means that the node the node that has no scheduled link or cost changes. The domain means that all the nodes in the domain will be affected by the variable node changes. So next please. So for we compare those remotes in from for perspectives For the centralized mode, We know that the schedule, the young model, can be distributed to all the nodes by controller. So No scheduled advertisement whether the variable node is supports routing protocol or not. And the the existing routing computation process need to be changed. Because scheduled information including link and the course in the yaw model is to be used when computing the routing table. And the delay before the scheduled time is each node Oh, and computation delay. next next next pits For the second mode, the First, the distributed mode. The sky to the young model is configured or distributed to the variable node"

The variable node advertises the information including link and the cost changing in advance of the scheduled time. The computation process on each node needs not to be modified. So back to the delay before the scheduled time is a night walk flooding delay, plus each node, the o and computation delay. For the second distributed mode, The variable node is not able to advertise the routing information by routing protocol because we know that in cabin are there network. The node may not have the routing capability. So the node cannot advertise the information by itself So the Sky to the model can be distributed by the 18 state node. which has the routing capability We can call this node Harper node. The helper node advertises, the information including link and the cost changing at once of the scheduled time. computation process is also can cannot be modified to fulfill the to achieve the can the go the calculation go The delay is the same with the distributed mode 1. So the it's the network of flooding delay plus each know the o and computation delay. Next. And we are not sure if TDR will cover all these modes but we think that explicit scenarios deployment scenarios. So will help the young model design and the provide the guidance for implementation"

Just we have I've WE HAD EARLIER PRESENTATIONS ON ON REQUIREMENTS FOR for TBR. Is there any do you see anything in in this work, when we talk about the nature of centralized and distributed and route advertisement that should themselves be flowed into either modes or requirements in the requirements document. Okay. Okay. I will read the requirements for multiple So to see it's already here. Right? Or or whether it should be added Okay. Okay. you. Thank you. Thank I know we have another s'more in the queue. Oh, please please discuss is AC Wyndham. I was I was just thinking at least for the IGP's the distributed mode too where there's a proxy that would advertise on behalf of someone. I don't know that I'm trying to think Other than redistribution if there's a natural way to do that. I know there is may be in You know you know you know what? It's it would almost seemed like the node itself even if you have somebody advertise on behalf of them, They don't generally have a way where where where they'd update their own state based on what a proxy is doing. It's it's it sort of seem it just looked at it, and I said, that's something No. The team. Maybe I maybe I misunderstood it, but I don't know. The thinking is from"

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it wouldn't be on behalf of someone who does the would do the advertisement in the traditional case. He would this this proxy would do the advertisement in all cases. Okay.
