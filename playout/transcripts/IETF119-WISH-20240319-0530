So I'm, full on delaying here because I don't have slides from, Sergio yet. So I'm hoping they're gonna arrive very shortly. Like I said, we'll probably not use the full hour a half. We're not gonna use a lot of time if we don't get slides when they're doing So I guess I can do the"

Well, there's another his his other document, which is the other one. You may pop up here. So I don't see him, but Yeah. We'll, give him a couple seconds. I think it's pretty early. I guess, like, 5. I it might be later than. It might be, like, 6. Still early. Cheers. Oh, we got emails. Mills is remote, and it's obnoxiously early where he is, I bet. Yeah. That's true. 6:30. Yep.

It is only Tuesday, so you may not have seen it. This is the whole, if you know about IPR, see something about IPR, and all the other, rules and policies related to the IETF, like, how to run a working group and all that good stuff. And, yeah, Andy, harassment procedures, code of conduct, copyright patents, etcetera. If you have any questions, you can ask the chairs and or area directors. But the basic rule is if you know something, say something, related to IPR and, with respect to code of conduct, nice to each other and pre treat each other professionally, and that's what all this is about. You know, to be nice to each other, and you don't have to love each other, but you need to respect each other and Be nice with the microphone. We got a pretty short agenda. Because we only really oh, this is why this is the meeting tips. Please make sure to log in using the site tool. With the QR code, I think, is it that is at the back of the room? To make sure we get an appropriately sized room. I don't think we're too worried about this one, Needham, more space, but, you know, I think we average about this many each time. Yeah. Too much space because it is it's a little off putting. I did TLS in the room. There was about was about 10% full. I was a little weird Alright. Agenda's more, resources, that you can click on. And our agenda is pretty short, blue sheets. That's how we keep truck of attendance is by scanning. We need to scribe, It's not gonna be much described, Neal. Do you mind taking over and doing Sure. No problem. Alright. Okay. Cool."

Right, before you switch off and we get Francesca. It it's actually been through all the director reviews. So I'm hoping to comments that we get will be pretty minor, and it should slide right through. It's well implemented in the whole nine yards. So I think we're gonna be out the door without really quickly. And then the web draft, which is what we'd be talking about today is, Oh, did I request 90 minutes? I can do that next time. I'll try to make it an hour. My bad. And, unfortunately, if slides anytime, we don't get from Sergio soon. We're not gonna have much to talk about because he was gonna make me live, and he said he was gonna do it. Because, again, there's really nothing to talk about with to the last call. There were, What, like I said, one set of comments and mostly they're put figure in the draft. And some other minor ID knits, which Sergio will gladly debt. Fixed, And so, unfortunately, Unless he shows up out of the blue, We've might be out of things to talk about. Keep clicking this. Don't know if there's any way anybody, in remote land. We're here as a way of, seeing if they can get in touch with them Yeah. I don't see him. It is possible. The only the only other comment I had, I think if I'm not mistaken, the web draft the only update was basically that he made the same changes in web as he did in Whip"

So there wasn't, like, really any major changes in terms of, like, features or anything like that, but, unfortunately, don't know. Other open discussions or topics he had on on his mind for the speeding Let's go I have to just pull that up, sir. Wish working group for repositories. Egress. We got one full request that is there, fixing typos. And 5 issues. So We can just go ahead and take the initiative Okay. Well, let's just not waste our time here and actually we can get a chat about this going have a see if pull this off. Start a little thing and see if I can't share my screen, and I don't Bring the world down here? Yeah. I gotta stop sides. Share the screen. I'm gonna accept that I'm gonna share the screen, and I'm gonna say I'm gonna This I'm gonna allow And then I think I just go over here, and we can go look at these. Are we actually seeing the screen? Ah, good stuff. Okay. Let me check. So there's, like, one pull request, and that's attribute requirements, May must not. Yeah. Okay. So that's That's good. And I guess we can When with the endpoint receives a request, its resources not exist, the web endpoint should return 404. Yep. Okay. Good. So I think he just needs to bake that one in. Right? I mean, that's fairly standard. Right? Yep. Yep."

I don't know why I put interim Alright. Alright. So the next one, if you guys can can you guys read that? Oh, small Alright. So it says when the screen ends, should the web player be notified? Then the media server terminates to connection, with web web player. Yeah. Any thoughts? Seems pretty reasonable, doesn't it? Yes. Right? Okay. Nope. Alright. So leave that one alone. Handle codec negotiation or how to handle the case when the stream's codec is not negotiated codec."

That's what I was gonna say. Lorenzo said in Webb, The subscriber sends the SDP offer They don't know what the stream supports in advance."

Donald Mags, I mean, standard SDK behavior is either fail the m line or fail the offer answer, I mean, If the client supported the codec or presumably would have offered it, If it doesn't support the codec the stream is in, failure is probably the right answer. That's I mean, maybe you know, you know, something more elegant. Would work. But if you, like, if you didn't support the if you if you actually supported that codec, why didn't you offer it in the first place? And if you don't support that codec being told, you need to support this codec. Doesn't help very much other than, you know, download this other browser or something. What he what he said? Adolf, Alistair. Alright. Because Mike offered that there was this other you related to to revisit set server offers."

Lorenzo drop dropped in the chat that the main reason Sergio wanted client side offers was to allow subscribers to open a web stream before it was actually available. This way you can negotiate multiple codecs and then server can reply with multiple codex."

Jonathan's reminding me, we're not supporting updated offer Right? Because otherwise, it seems like This would just be a updated offer answer. But if that's not supported, then You have to do something else. Soon. I mean, I think maybe a lot of things, if there were updated offer answer, could be done, but maybe that's a hard in this model. When the you know, we guess the wrong codec could also be an updated offer answer. Right? Unfortunately, I don't have much to offer here, guys. Don't have much to offer here"

But, I'll just say it's been a pleasure supporting you for the time that I've been with you. Your working group transfers Wednesday afternoon to Francheska and the new WIT area. So be looking after you going forward. I will continue to finish the wish document. Yeah. Okay. Be taking over. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. They will. So the secretary, it is feverishly typing, changing permissions, chowning, chowning, emoting, and stuff. I, I I did. I I did mean to to do a whole, like, welcome to the wit thing, but I completely forgot. So We're now in a we're in a new area. We're we're in a new area. So it's very exciting. Alright, Franchesca. I just wanted to say that if you need to schedule an interim, That's a possibility once. You know, we make sure that everybody's here. And, Yeah. We can do that. That's probably not a bad idea. Yeah. Because, again, I think that, like, the plan really is for this working group, gonna get through WAP then we're done. Right? And then any any additional extensions we're gonna get discussed somewhere else,"
