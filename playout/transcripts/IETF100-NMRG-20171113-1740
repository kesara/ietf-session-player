    "text": "okay so hello everybody so I\u0027m going to present a draft distinguishing intent policy in service models the draft co-written was a bit long and with lisandro and the purpose of this draft is really basic to to clarify those termini see how those different concepts relate to one another so essentially it\u0027s basically is motivated by the fact that they intend to find networking is a is increasingly buzzword and of course that the concept is you define basically what you want not how to get it and it sounds of course great I mean this is this is very attractive really busy but you would want to obtain is an operator however the question is is this idea really new and actually really it is not there are several things that suppose that came before it and so the question is basically so is it just a new term for the same concept or basically is there something different and how can we busy distinguish between between these different items and see there are particularly two aspects of that that or two other concepts or two other terms that send out there one is policy based management this of course has a very long history of 320 plus 20 plus D plus plus years same idea you defined as you think that the high level and busy leave it to different stages and so busy render the policy to do the rest so you don\u0027t have to worry about the low-level details and the second aspect is service models and service provisioning we have also similar things you\u0027re defining service at a very high level concept this is baby what I want services I want to get and you leave it to service provisioning systems and what have you to figure out what are the low level details so therefore basically you get the question is is this policy about certain amounts synonyms are they do they mean different things and by all those some how do they relate and is busy the purpose or the intent of this draft and this falls of course discussion that we had actually also previously in Lisbon and then progress okay so basically in terms of the different terms all the when you look at the draft I think it has Betty the way it is structured as actually it finds somebody introduces those terms anybody tries to distinguish distinguish them so very straightforward so policies there are different definitions for policies rules governing the choices and behavior of a system is basically the classical definition of Stormin in 94 there are other definitions by John Stroessner by RFC 31 98 and and and others busy always basically they have in common they\u0027re sets of rules that you define it at a high level tool to define manage control access to network resources and so forth and then contrasting to that there\u0027s intent in RFC 75 75 actually this came "

    "text": "confusion in the use of the terms we have been Sdn NFV but also in network management everyone is using intents for their own purpose usually related to different approaches and different means of realizing a Nitin based system and also targeting different levels or different layers so for someone an intent is just the first level of abstraction on top of an SDN switch or is in controller but for other people in is what the user is injecting to a toward an operator or network so it\u0027s very different levels of intents so there is different producer different consumer of intents the I think most common aspect of intent that everyone converging is that it\u0027s an abstraction it\u0027s not it\u0027s not much to say that but at least everyone converts saying that we need to work on abstractions those abstractions can be at different levels representing different things but at least this is a means people want to use a neighbor I would say more powerful attract management at a configuration so the question comes now what to do next and I think we will also explore that later offline but first you remind that we are in a research group so just to contradict a bit Taurus about letting I mean the industry or the things stabilized on this side I think we are here also to a bit work ahead of time I mean ahead of the con of the of the market so we need to investigate this I mean if the research group agreed on that this is I think something we should do ahead of of the industry not saying that the industry will not do what they want but at least from a research perspective we need this is something we could do so the effort will surely beyond the terminology or taxonomy there would surely be something like this as discussed in previous meetings there is also the aspect of identifying key components I mean functions and techniques to realize intern base networking system which is also useful in identifying how to build a Newton based system and maybe in between those two that can be a work to identify either for the use cases or operational practices what are really the challenges we want to address with intern base networking because so far we have been talking about techniques how we can do stuff but not really maybe pinpoint what is challenging currently in networking and why intern based network could be a good concept to address those challenges I do like just to try to also summarize but it seems to me data we are talking at least about three different aspects the first one is the terminology defining what what an intent is and what it is not so you know what\u0027s the relationships for example between intent "
