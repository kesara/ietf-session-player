    "text": "now it works exactly the same way as the other one except my margins are a little smaller because they don\u0027t have to accommodate line delay now and everything spins two hops in every spins two cycles in every relay because I have to keep the buffer separate so the per hop delay is twice as long but again the calculations are trivial the other cyclic queuing and so that explains cyclic you in 40 there\u0027s the slide that says the words I just said the time scheduling every output queue has a gate that\u0027s controlled by a rotating schedule that has a precision of up to one nanosecond and that\u0027s all there is to it I\u0027ve got these gates that control my output queues this solution is different from the others and that the bandwidth of a queue the bandwidth of my buffer resources can be multiplexed in time I can have one hello use the gate use the queue at this time and then at another time another flow can use this queue that supports the non-continuous we have in the architecture we talked about continuous flows and I forget what the other term is time flows or well flows like video need the queuing mechanisms we talked about before industrial automation you often have a burst of traffic from this device then a burst of traffic from this device and it\u0027s all synchronized so I can reuse the same resources first for this kind of flow then for that kind of flow that\u0027s a different use and so yes oh go ahead ask your question okay so the time schedule queuing the good news is that scheduling every transmission allows you to optimize everything you can optimize latency buffer space jitter interference with best effort traffic any other QoS parameter you can name everything is available for optimization the downside is number one at the present the standard only supports 8 gates 8 timed queues not one per flow for a thousand flows and also computing for a schedule for a network is typically an NP complete process now that doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t solve it there are certainly solutions out there in use today but it\u0027s not a trivial it\u0027s not a trivial problem and so this is my last slide which is why would like this to become a an adopted document I would "
