What's happened here, unstable connection to serve a fan test I don't know if my arrow case will work anymore at the stage. Anyway, so we've got this little intro at the start.

We're on the jam agenda now. So right. Okay. Cool. Go ahead. Would you like to share them or do you want me to pop up for you? If you could pop them up, gonna be great news Just a couple. So... So the short status is is calendars we think is nearly done. I have there's been excuse me. New draft since last time think guys next slide, please.

And Yes. The with Calendar stuff is to until we have get come of ready to go at the same time, and then we'll do those together. Marco? Hi. This is Jonas. Speaking. So Yeah. So I was part of the discussion on the list about the kind preferences object So the discussion was is Does it... So Janet mail has a role property for the folder object. The mailbox, which defines several types And in Calendars, the idea is to not have that then to use a to only have a default calendar folder or not and the whole discussion was about we need more than that? Is it enough? Maybe? In summary, my my point of view here is that I would preferred to have more roles here more more types of folders, but I don't have a strong opinion on that. So it seems like there's is strong incentive on only using the east default. That's fine for me. So the idea here was if you have annotated if you have like auto generated birth birthdays or similar"

So that tells you on an event basis. But Hans. Yes. This is Hans. I have a strong opinion on This and from a data perspective, there's quite some systems actually which to have these auto generated photos in a way and you typically wanna handle them special in a way because otherwise you might even call cost duplicates on the destination and so on and so on it's on. And I'm not convinced of so much that this will be solved or it makes things certainly complicated only happens on some other item base because these auto generated things like for instance, from anniversaries which many systems do it's basically each and every item in that folder, which for which to applies to. So I would find it more clean and more in line with existing systems if that would be something like a special use property on so canada folders. A How is that exposed in existing systems they actually say it is anniversaries county both birthdays. So what we do in existing systems so in existing systems currently, this is not to be distinguished. So what we do basically is we have apply heuristic based on the full name. So we know actually in a critical power system folder or calendar called birthdays or anniversaries? Is actually an all populated folder and so we skip this folder migration, if he knows it in the destination system, a similar folder will be automatically"

For instance. Interesting. Yeah. I definitely think this is kind of off double is default. It's kind of a separate thing. I wonder whether he wants me like, is also generated or generating from or something like that. To say this calendar is something Yeah. So what I'm currently out of comfort zone because I would actually need to look to... So what this this related to actually is things probably like shared folders. That might be all kind of special cases, sometimes, you know, where you have something in the user's folder visible, which is not actually created explicitly by user. So this universal revised... Example is just a very specific one. I probably might to look look again. My strong gut feeling is that such mechanism might also prove useful in additional cases actually without being able to point on one. Well, if you perhaps follow up on the list then like, later Yeah more examples and kinda of times like go back and look at it a bit more. I think that'd be really helpful. And that was where It got to the thread I asked like, yeah, What are current things do what we actually need to be able to represent here. Yeah. And then we can come to conclusion on that Okay. Cool. Thank you. I think Yes. That's kind of the main thing to be resolved and we've got a bit of time is yes. Come this as a little way off, but hopefully we can get that resolved and still get this published. Later this year. Not too long much later. Hopefully. Go to the next slide, just briefly.

This is Robert Step next speaking. I only have one remark for alerts that I would like to discuss, but I'm not sure if this will not type of deck. So oh, the last side of this for me. This is Yep. So I asked a smart thing. I I recently implemented alert and the came with calendar spec currently defines that for if an event is in multiple calendars, you use the e for the earth set on all calendars where that event is in, which which make sense to me. The thing is the spec also currently says, you take all of them as I read respect. And I do wonder if we should allow some leeway for the implementation to decide for example, tool alerts give two different alerts of different calendars on the same event. That have the same trigger and the same action might actually not trigger twice Yep. But the course that's point. Okay Yeah. Can you email me after afterwards raise it? Github. Take it or something we we'll discuss that. Okay. Yeah. I I might propose there if you had eu idea on the alerts and they had the same Eu id. Then suppress them the server could actually combine them and give them the same Id idea. So so this pack already says that alert default alert Ids, chamber ids, must be unique across all calendars.

Are still on Gs calendar are we on something else now? Question. Yep. On. Yes. We are still learn Js Calendar. So then Okay. Alright. The next slide I believe is on sharing, which we may well do now as well. Yeah. Sorry that I was I was just saying I think I got good ahead myself. Went to just take this to last school and publish it. After last meeting and I didn't get advantage. I need to fix up the section references and stuff. I've just been doing that this week so Hoping I'm give it a last week through, and then published new version hopefully can get last call tomorrow. Alright.

For symmetry with the activate script So we use this a lieu of a null argument to activate script to deactivate the script And if you wanna actually change the active script for one to the other you actually need to use both of these arguments. Pretty simple change in the text. And if there's no issues, there think we're pretty much ready for the last call because I think the list the four protocols pretty fully make. Hi, Kansas. This is Hans. I've just small. I think we we shot talked about that previously so I've don't have a talk later on in the extra session about handling and so on.

So what's new and the newest version? We I had some feedback on the One and five and in Car connect, I worked. Yeah, not all of that. What also that... In, I would say, So first, I structured the person object. To align with a J's contact offer object. Jay's contact has notes. So the the idea the feedback was We have comments and checklists and maybe a bunch of other properties that are connected to a so entity? And Jay's contact has something So contact has notes on a contact which is connected to a certain entity.

So checklists, at last, I had some present some slides on how to do that. Try to have a discussion here and I decided on using a single checklist object and not link relations that was the alternative I presented last time. So I decided find an actual object because it's says very simple way. It provides a simple way to specify what properties should actually be be supported by items in a checklist. Because typically, you won't don't wanna have all of the items all of the properties of a task for an item in a checklist. And it's easier to handle sometimes if you use link relations, you could end up a task could end up referencing something that's non existent, and you need would need to handle that somehow. And it might even be more efficient but not sure if that's. Very good reason. Yep. So we now have a checked this object and a checklist in task Yeah.

Because the draft doesn't currently reflect what's how it's been done in in General Calendars columbus. I will publish a new version. Soon with that. So the idea and general calendars is that a person object that's currently used in a notification there? We'll have three different ways how it's connected to a certain entity either it's a simple email address, that the Ui can then look up you to look up certain details of a of a person or it's an actual principal Id or it's something that identifies a participant of the underlying topic of the underlying data format. So person is so the participant here is something that's from the title format. Js Calendar and person the space a layer on top of it's in the Api. It also uses Well, theoretically, can use the principle. To identify information about a person. Yeah. So I need to use that in checklist and comments.

Also you wanna give have give have an api perspective that we can just give to vendors of legacy legacy systems, which currently don't do not have an appropriate Api for certain data types. And additionally, we wanna combine we wanna combine the Came Spec with additional solutions or extensions for migration in portability related. Issues that we observed? Yep. So that's currently the scope of the spec. Which is open for a discussion if that makes sense to put it all in the singles spec. You will see soon it's I have quite a lot. I think this is quite so long ox. Let's see. You don't need to jump in right ahead if you have questions, but feel free to do so. So Yes. All observations on Rf eight six two zero is it's really nice that it's feature rich. It's really nice that generic, so we can use it for migrations but it's sadly a bit complex because it has so many features.

Have simple guidance on the bare minimum for a one time migration use case? So we have a lower entry barrier. Yeah. So In more detail, what what did we do? What this what's in the stack? First, in the session resource, it can be session results can be reflected by Jason having many constant values for a lot of use cases, actually. And the idea is to focus only on key objects, methods and properties, defined by J Carr for the migration use case. And also, the idea right now is to have a minimal version of Jam post defined? Have and have very minimal additional see use cases that add more implementation effort on top of the minimal version of. For example, what we wanna what we leave out is here we no query for some use cases, so the query method can be left out in some cases or typically, there is no need to implement methods like copy, or changes in a first iteration implementation. Other things we left out is batch so support push and on. So... Yeah, this might be somewhat controversial And that really"

I forgot to say currently leader The spec is supposed to be an informational spec. It's supposed to be guidance on how to implement I c eight six two zero. But it also introduces it simplified request team. Scheme. So the requirements are even lower for certain very certain ancient legacy implementations. Or... It's also the the entry areas even though far certain use cases. Doesn't matter how old the implementation is actually. So the third thing also in there. I also already is extensions for further migration related problems. Improve which as supposed to improve even further. That's one thing I'm gonna talk about. At the very end. So focusing on key objects methods and properties. So the idea here is document how to implement R c eight six zero in a minimum way the first, and then find additional steps for common use cases. Common use cases are data x export data import typically? That export can optimally have listing and paging. Which is currently all required by or not. I wouldn't say required, but it's typically all listed in our see eight six two zero just as is. And some use cases require additional attachment support, some don't.

For for a new project manager that wants to implement. J app, and then you can talk to c o. This is what I need to tell my developers? And this is what it looks like. That's an from the table that that's in the spec right now. Sorry on the in the columns. On the left column, you can see the time up call feature? Of the spec here, it's a method or the get method or request. Gut method response and then the properties separate properties of request and response listed as a single. Line? And export use cases, export Exporting is one very important use case for parting is one important use case for and then there are some more advanced things like cor. And, basically, what we right now did is What do I actually need? I don't really need minimum implementation I don't really need card echo. For for importing or exporting But for exporting, I need to get my data out of the systems when a get method. Need to implement whole request. In the second line now, but but I don't need necessarily need the properties method. Which has some more advanced features. So this is slim. Displayed with a minus."

And I already got some feedback on the list on that. That this is not really conform with do the current Rf eight six susie zero. So And the idea here was instead of just omit certain things, or recommending to submit certain things. One should reply with an error message in some cases saying, hey, I don't support this. Or sometimes this actually something I edit as a more workaround around for supporting the full spec. Sometimes things can be just implemented as a constant value. So this is what I'm gonna present on Just like the next iteration of the spectre, that's not currently what's in there, but that comes from the discussion on the meeting list meetings certain features has forbidden? Like I just said. And use constant values or error responses. Instead of just submitting. As I just said. So For example, how can we do that? For example, a state? Or session state could just be an empty. There's no if there's no need to res rethink then just have it in the response have it in the session object. But make it an empty string. Don't leave it out. It's required by the spec. Also the download url if you don't have attachments, it an empty empty stream.

Say, oh, I don't know this method. So fail Yeah. It's a very generic Error But it's the most fitting in this case that I could come up with If it's a get request and you don't implement that, then reply with request to large. Because you set max objects and get to zero. You don't allow any objects in your get request. You can see this is really obvious sometimes. And then for set, if you don't implement that reply with can't on the error. Because you said can't read only to true. This took me quite some time to figure out which error to respond in which case. So Yep. One of the big questions is does it make sense like this? Or doesn't even make more sense to have it as a separate thing that's not fully conform to R c eight six two zero. But I will have that question somewhere. Maybe Nick, just shortly, this is like an extension slide, and then I can take your question. So this is in more detail what it looks like that's the same the same table, basically revised version But this time, I actually changed the columns, so trying not to be cautious confused.

Neil has a question here was following somehow at least. Hello. Can transfer Yeah. It was it was just good question. Just think this approach make sense just because this means that if you've got some library that chain up. It should just work with this. Like, I know we've had problem before with the rust presentation that had very strict, like, checking of, you know, response property.

So I think it's important to understand for everybody we we our use cases migration So we we never had the intention or maybe have some future somehow to use J as it just designed for as an internal probability protocol to build a client You know, that continuously acts in on behalf of a user a server. But we found actually our use case is possibility portability or migration. However you phrase that. And the clear level is of course, the data object there. Yeah. So it was tempting for us of course because we we were searching for quite a long time for a standard Api, we can... Especially in case of legacy systems"

So sometimes this is why there is a distinction between imported export because we typically, in these situations these systems will only it's a legacy system. So they will just export obviously because the system will be dead afterwards. And clearly, once this points out is from a protocol level, Of course, first of all these vendors we cooperate with, or we help migrate don't have... We cannot tell I'm implement J. Because They will say are you crazy? Why should we implement batch or something like that. It's just not required for that use case, because difference between data or migration and inter interoperability of full fledged protocol is that you just don't, you know, have certain use cases like changing stuff or so on because the data will be copied out once and again and that's it. And the same happens also on our side yeah. So for the client we are client obviously in that case or man in the middle yeah because we read from the source right to a destination which might be on my top I also. So also we don't basically implement all of J for that. Yeah. So you find all the nice libraries we produced so far, a little bit incomplete yet. Which just fine it's open source. Everybody can complement it. Yep. And yeah. So we bought this as you are set to the Of London and think. So the idea was it would be helpful to documents this in some way must not even be an Rc or so. I think there was some discussions that at in London that it might be helpful their specs. That's why we are here. So just everybody notes in that case. Second remark very shortly. So this gets back now to this error thing. Yeah. So obviously, in a very much case, I now describe. Actually, it's also kind of pointless for a legacy vendor to tell them to implement some of the methods produced and error because actually in the migration center we as a client will ensure we are the only client from that legacy system so we will never call any of these vessels and it's totally be pointless to"

There, of course, it could run make sense because they are people could also use it let's say I have a mobile client with J and wanna use that. In order to exert the right of data portability and get out of the system. So I agree that for that case, actually, it's perfectly fine and a good idea to have these error messages. It would probably not make sense one off migration center. So just to clarify, so this is not you're not voting for either option. So you're not saying it's better to have this back be conform with Rf eight six. Two zero or you having it as a separate version of J I did not... So I think one needs I mean, in in in a way anyway, a legacy system, which uses this boarding won't be a afraid if it cannot itself label compliant to suspect here so They can just leave it out. Might make sense to have a footnote in a specs that especially say it. So it the developers are not super confused when we give some back and they say, okay, there is the thing... It's not a... I mean, this is not something we see to decide right now. Problem. Qm. I would like to say that I agree with your what's the word approach to this.

That tends to cause problems like down right all the other arrows you've suggested seem to make relative sense. But may maybe more research required on the just internal era. That is a really great feedback that shows me... Because I also also have that on the next slides somehow now. It shows me that people were actually following what I said. So let me just If it's okay, there's brown in the queue? Yeah. I was gonna to say, what's the argument for not requiring core echo even in the most basic of basic service. It is literally the simplest possible thing you can do. Why would you why you consider out so be compliant if it can't do cor echo. It's just return the thing that you've just been given back down the wire. It's just I try to leave out as much as I can. Irrespective of much implementation effort it would be? Yeah. That's something I didn't look into. Yet. I think cor is probably the one that you could say you have to have because that is the way that anyone tests. That the server exists. And he did it it's talking J. That's. Yeah. So say cor, even if you even to the absolute minimal camera server you should do that. Yeah. So mean, before I...

Right now, the only error I was I found I was fitting is Summer fail, which is basically defined as an annex affected or unknown error. But not having clarity implemented And then people calling it, should certainly be expected, I would say. So not a perfect thing to use. Similarly, if I use if I sometimes for queries limit property for some properties. The only fitting error message I found was invalid arguments. It's it's a valid property. It's defined in R c eight six two zero. So calling it invalid might also be kind of confusing? So this error approach, I'm not sure if it's the perfect solution, maybe we we would need to extend Jane Colbert with new error messages So have, like, something not implemented or I'm not sure. But certainly, I would say it's not perfect as it is, or I was just maybe unable to find the fitting error message. So if anybody has feedback on that, feel free, to say now or jump on the list.

Man. Sorry. Such a long talk. Hi. Tim. I I I think the way that I would think of this is is This is kind of a profile of J map for a particular application. So I... You know, I would kind of document it that way. I think it may I agree with the the the sense that there's some implementations that are very strict and therefore you want to not violate this back, but sort of having particular, you know, for for this application like for data portability and and so forth. To have a profile, I think is is a very would be a very useful document to have as at least informational, maybe maybe even standards track.

Also, accessing share data is not required? So now getting no setting shared data because you would need the account Id for that. Also the capabilities and restrictions, for example, Next May box male, your properties like Don, are the same for every user, If you have all those three, which typically a lot of bit what use cases have?

Not really secrets, I would say, but yeah, that's one downside. Didn't notice. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I was gonna set those an idea that I've been playing around with for a while, which was to create a rest mapping for J objects. So you would you'd advertise rest your uri and say under here slash object, and then and use rest star rather than Jam Style. Queries to access it, which might map more to what you want there, but I days parameters still, I guess, you fetching multiple days the same time so some kind of multi get thing potentially So will you support Ids then, like, a single item well... Yeah. Basically a single idea in a apart. And if you wanted to request multiple things you do something like Shape two query where you're fetching multiple urls in a a single stream.

Alright. Last second on these two slides left. It also... It this in the appendix, because I also... Yeah. Don't think it fits in an information back. We included Gem debug. Capability new one. Yeah the idea is yet supply lock messages along the usual data exchange instead of sending them through a separate channel, so then you can just have a gym request And just use the capability debug and then you get locks in addition to the usual reply respective of what you used as a method? Yeah. An example use case is if you have a J Api, server we're running on a third party infrastructure and you cannot access it its locked, then you can just use the same channel. Yeah. So I would say I don't need to ask the question it should not be in the same spec? Similar for the second extension that's currently inside the appendix of the spec. Yeah. Some where we have the gem second info the idea quickly here that some sort of doesn't properly follow the core Rf.

So the question now is, what do I do with those extensions and with the informational stack. Oh, then I have to the room. Okay. This sensor again, just a very small to those last two things. So It's the distinction prior. There is a data, two use cases. Really constrained one where there a legacy server which is shut whatever. There situation, you might use it in the data life ongoing kind of setting. So these two last ones are very particular dealing with these legacy situations, so especially one might be very look very weird for many of you in a way, but it makes very much sense and said legacy thing, because you might end up with an nice p who has some legacy platform. There is no more access to the platform no way to lock out something somewhere and we give them an Api spec for J and implement J saying and say cannot give us locks if anything fails. So zed was basically the idea to create a back channel to our system where we can see where something broke in the mapping from their database to chain it. So it's... I agree. It's a little bit weird. Probably. However, we saw we also mentioned it here because there might also be used cases like you know in settings where some somebody is implementing jam from some system where this might be handy in some situations whatever.

It's not hundred percent true because there is Lin mail or client implementation for mail and be recently started developing a little bit for fun. Jam calendar and contact support in here partially because we have this implementation for instance for our around what and there's currently no way you cancelling around by mail address books or calendars. With a mobile phone. So we thought that could actually be, you know, a nice extension here and we actually found out that for this very particular use case of for instance syncing contact, this minimal Api which we also use for migration is actually also quite sufficient to do actually probably a simple sync app because, you know, contact data is not So vol is typically clear so that you need something like, you know, fancy patching and kind of stuff, You can even circumvent update by doing a thirty lead and trade. So this is a little bit more to get you thinking that's this kind of profile might even be interested in certain scenarios to have really maybe you know, an easier entry barrier for adoption of even interoperability clients. I'm I'm not saying this is necessarily a good idea. I totally agree if somebody is not so happy with that. But personally also thinks that could be something like you know, incremental pass into, you know, more deep general supported the later point if you have really, really an easy creek start where you can have a very simple implementation which already brings you value.

That case it said that you don't emit these things at all or you just submit the basic one that doesn't have the to on tagging it.

So first question is or I'm not sure if this is the thing, but I could imagine and there is security issue here in terms of actually the server is exposing sort of internal information or behavior. So I wonder if cisco be leveraged by attackers in terms to find out, you know, how could be stressed in a more particular way. I'm not sure if it's a good argument because you could still do so by use just usual commands, but this gives you extra information probably on, you know, how stressed the server is for a certain moment, but other of people might be much more much more educated to answer this question I'm sorry.

So as far as sun know, there is currently no such structured way to notify sw to a client So especially if or, I think it's there is sometimes error messages somehow but this is still something also I trying need parse. And I see a relation shortly. So struggling is when, you know, when the server has rate limits, or right limits on Sorry? No no. What I want to explanation what the Sorry. Yep.

So I think this could be it somehow in additional or related information. But yeah. That's what I I think so, we might need to think about it that this might be a separate thing. Yeah. Again, like from fetch is I'm right hand clyde that by b heavily I don't actually Like, if the server will start rejecting my second fetch because it's in the same pipeline. I think that's silly. I'm not actually asking for specific speed from the server. I'm just asking that my fetch will be dissatisfied if the server wants to slow down how it sends it to me, that's completely fine. So, you know, there there might be some interesting issues there. If it's What I can think of probably more interesting is if you start running multiple searches and parallel. So we decides that now this is too many searches. I don't want to allow for that. But then the server can say Well, reject there. Second third or whatever.

So this runs back actually, here go to, you, lunch off at the vienna F. And I finally found some time to write down and yeah. You'll see what it's about. So probably everybody in a room roughly knows as a mere official language, we had it on in some of the previous part. So it's managed as h based protocol to let users, manage those trips. Next slide, please. So the question though is how is actually used in the wild. And there might be some statements here one it could challenge, but this is basically based on personal observation in the certain way and or informed observation. But I'm I'm happy to discuss also part it later on, maybe. So typically, usage like Sip typically explained, is like what I call your direct usage, which I think is like, it actually edit a conceived script where all your rules are defined in language. Use either do that on your local file system or your service file system where where file stored? Or a service is managed, managed actually gives you a way to obtain the file from the server and edit it with with whatever client or editor or you have and send it back. In order to do so, you need to understand language. Understanding self language, probably is nothing what the average and an user is capable to do."

So this is for experts I would say. Now. So then, what do I see in practice? There is also a lot of? Which actually is somehow created by users but not we are directly the file, not we. But actually by a user interface with z Ui. And this is what I call your field the editing user interface so this your eyes don't allow you to edit a whole script. But to give you something, like a drop down list so you can select like, from... You can enter an email address, you'll can select from a list of support actions, filter into or file into sorry, and you have you can browse the folder basically. Think all of you probably have seen such kind of stuff. There is related case which I call the indirect creations. This is basically some systems offer you in your inbox, you do a right click on a mail and you can say, puts this use on allow list Quite often this actually triggers in the background or will be stored for rule. In a similar fashion, there is what I call your special use filters So for instance, in your mail you are, you might have a featured certification notice said other forward or to max expand. It's probably more related to. The first one here. And these typically or can optional be mapped thirty the very much on the system, but Sip is a mechanism which solar systems actually use to realize this functionality.

So overall, I would say is this indirect usage scenario which has different facets as I just pointed out is I would argue probably is the most used part of Sift in the wild when it comes to user base scripts, But, yeah. I it's at least used to to a very large extent. I've probably we won't argue if it's more scripts. Otherwise, but, yeah. Next slide. Next slide, please. Next. Yep. Not responding hang us. Okay. Good. Okay. Thank you. So how does it work in practice, actually? So got interesting. So these sip scripts created by Ui and by special safe rules actually these things are look different, let's try put it that way from those system scripts edited by users. So I've never seen so far and I've seeing quite a number of systems with these you know, end user search rules let's say use also else, but the also very modular. So each of these rules to be separate from each other so there's no else as kind of stuff. But it's basically an a a rule and then typically a stop like that, which makes pretty much sense because it's some our matches we c paradigm because you can have multiple rules underneath each other. Furthermore of all, these rules typically quickly clear are not very deeply nest because in those ui developers didn't take a much of an effort to allow you five times nested"

First modular rules have something like a name typically, which is displayed in the web mail user interface. And the spec actually gives no place for that name. So there is no way in the spec where actually windows could stalls it. The same applies for the types. So how do vendors know that a certain rule which say store is actually that rule for the vacation notice of all the other forward? Classification notice you with they can identify by a test, but a to action... Sorry. But for other special use rules that we not be possible and also the order sometimes is things I wanna source separately. So once I do they do, We have second yes. I do do use it in header comments. So they do comments in the c script, and there is a pattern whether it say comments name, key value is status rule name. And so just want the power when a a fills weapon using the face and on the right back. Second aspect is actually dea activation of modular routes. So in these ui, you have those twenty filters. You can enable this. Some things that sift by itself doesn't really support. There is support for multiple scripts when you have managed safe. Some of the systems do that and move this small rule to the other shifts. Script as us actually just comment out individual rules with in the larger script of those module scripts and some even do wrapping. So that just once you click disable, I will update the sip rule on the back end in an all of false and then the other test statement to make sure they will trigger. And so shows us as disabled in the Ui, Next slide, please. So this is what's there in practice. What's the problem here? So the problem obviously is interoperability because I"

A provider officer a third party client has big trouble in supporting multiple different systems because if you would allow a more sophisticated if you are, you would risk to mess up with ways of used in the vendors actual Ui. With the naming the user could probably mess up with the special use stuff and so on. And dealing with the deactivated rules the same thing. It's also a pot issue. Because as scripts might also break if you just migrate from another system in the back end. And also, you might need to consider that special use stuff might be handled in a different way between different systems. So once system might use vacation notices, via sift scripts, whereas a new system, where the migration goes on tool, just two vacation notice in a totally different way. So if you now just copy over the Sip script, you actually end up having two different vacation notices on the same user, which is obviously not to desire behavior. Next slide, please. Yeah. So I hope the problem somehow came a little bit clear. So I think this is at least worthy probably some informative description of what is say a while. So you inform at least clients about forms of comments and scripts and I to need to encounter and what to do about it. An open question if is this should also probably have norma dimension, like actually prescribing a certain pattern of comments or as a ways, probably in the room for doing comments for doing this kind of motivation for maybe also defining something in the head script that's an open question for discussion, now, this is actually worse"

You know, the whole complexity of having totally nested rules is more complex to be implemented. Is it something really required everybody.
