As a courtesy for others, and then to have give talk to everyone. For the normal number working king group contributors, please focus on what is your addressing what do the address of of the regular charter for new summary of the technical renaissance and for not so new drugs what have been changed.

Here is the structure in the first section, we leased the Dynamic controller requirements which which aligns with the data platform framework.

And also we give some had a control plan considerations for a based of the network mechanisms. And also, we give over overview for that and management plan. In this just updated version. Thanks for the contribution from carlos, we have ended a new section about multi domain aspects. This section is and supports collaborations of multiple controller functions among different than domains.

What we're trying to do now is to make it more logical. Maybe we should end a very simple figure as as showed in the picture to make it a logical process about the whole control plan, including resource collection, past calculation, pass allocation and the results reservation. But the contents will be almost a same. Yeah. And this is another proposed update is also very simple. We have done a control plan. We have a management plan.

We do need to proceed from requirements the solution. So we already impose some sort of sort of cutoff off at which point we we probably start using the premise tracking roughly it's form at that time. I think there was a request to me find some to facilitate longer presentation, potential solutions because of ten minute slots that we can allocate in the meeting is just hard and not really me go to into the solutions and details And finally, suggestion that addition to the requirements in the requirements draft we we will walk the pay some attention to a evaluation criteria would be used that we would use choose a among solution when we have multiple choices, and I think that's an important suggestion about which there'll be further consideration and discussion.

But I will not this step today. And if you use that value, the entertain latency of the flow is bounded like that. Yeah. There are so many parameters, but all of them are as specific to the flows. Except the l and larger r. Is the initial packet value over all the flows in the node. And large you are installing capacity. So there's two values you cannot control.

And that was about, you know, the specification of the mechanism to be too much a descriptive, instructive rather what what seem to be necessary and so far as using a queue to n q in a slot and then to d you from it. And so when I revisit that again, Obviously, for T, It doesn't matter of how packets are released from a slot and forwarded to the next lot right? So they can be randomly ordered on every hop and the overall late can see and Jitter in the end, will still say the same but as soon as we have more than one packet from a single flow, in a single slot. Then reorder would obviously be undesirable. And obviously, would also be undesirable to have another header to do reorder at the end. So I think at this point in time, the proposal is... And that's what in two that we wanna maintain for every package that come in from the same incoming interface going out into the same cycle, the order it should be maintained. That's now shown in the pseudo code, but the timing with which you know, packets from different incoming interface in the same slot are sent out or, you know, if if things are send out as fast as possible within slot or spread around. That's next free. And I have to describe that in the text. Next slide? Right? And this is kind of the the way that the pseudo code looks right now. So was kind of trying to abstract for all packets, and then there is just q for all the packets for a particular cycle from the same incoming interface, but other than that, it's scheduled to send packets before next cycle starts.

And obviously, it's Tc, like, I guess, all of our algorithms are applicable to centralized control plane mission controller, path computation engine, And of course simple admission control policies as outlined in ingress per maximum number of bits. So that's I think very easy to see when you give a flow a certain number of bits in every site you can get more efficiency in the same way as in the Ts solutions that are based on the same principles if you allocate fewer bits, but then you have to do a more network wide quotation in the centralized controller, which is also one of the great ways why you may wanna have a centralized component Now for those of us full of the distributed models like Rs Pt as the controller plane, that will work equally well except obviously that one has to because whether you wanna have a distributed control plane when you are trying to be stateless, But so what I was writing there is that The state is in the forwarding plane at one hundred gigabit is a completely different gold than state is that the control plane for the number of flows the combination may still be very valuable.

And and the idea really is to to arrive at something like back sheet with the different criteria, right? That rx x explaining the properties of the algorithm so so that they can be compared and then I've got an sample spray spec for one method, which you as you can guess is the algorithm that I've been trying to write down Tc q Next slide. So I let out all the explanations of his which are in there, so every line is one criteria. So the first one latency guarantee, right? So there any... Well, given that we're right here now working on them, the should be so bounded or heuristic, So Jack stein was proposing that we should also have heuristic ones, so far, I think all the ones that are currently actively pursued are bounded. The hope I hope jitter bounce nice marketing terms or more explicit description in time on time. You know, in time would be as soon as possible. Right, The network load is low, then the packet is forward it without any queuing delay. And the on time is you're exactly always arriving at the bounded latency or closed therefore. Network applicability So maybe of course categorization which forwarding plane, would it work for Ip Ip six mp? Maybe others be right, multi cost, or subset thereof off. Is it intended for really high speed networks? I think right now most us are looking into these high speed networks, but that doesn't mean for the overall evaluation of forwarding plane reasons, like even the existing ones that we should not kept sure that are that typically bounded by, you know, not wanting to go further than ten gigabit which is, I think what we're seeing in Gsm. Does it require a new packet header over the wire? Yes no or optional?"

The the latency is is a bound or else the that their scheme doesn't work. Just a requirements for wire line links and for radio links. I've I separated it out because I think most of us have only looked at wire line links, I guess, when we wanna talk to mobile networks, they may also ask applicability across Radian, we may just not have thought about it. And then is the algorithm asynchronous kronos? Yes, or no? Which basically means then we're get into clocking. And the the way I could have... The best I can capture right now is the maximum time interval error between the clocks and what impact has on down latency next slide? So the traffic model of the flows in terms of finding, you know, for how the traffic can express their characteristics, the forwarding model and obviously for Tc you have this state, less method without flow information is important. And then the algorithm parameters and The calculus, right? Is the calculus for the mechanism available is published and then all so, you know, is it linear so far is that we can calculate it independently for every... For every hop independent of the others and then just add up, for example, the the latency. And then the packet, right. Compatibility with the hop hub source routing, Sr mp Sr six. For example, end to end, packet header requirements, right so something that doesn't change across the path when it gets longer, and as well requirements where like, you know, the steering, which that that where the headache gets longer the longer the path is.

Does it require a new on the wire packet header fields no calls, we are very confident we can use a ds. And the Not ex p field Greg is going to kill me. I'm always also remembered It's in the draft, but I can I always only member? Right? So the latency requirement the links other than C, the the the link latency And jitter requirements are can arbitrary link latency at can arbitrary Jitter, obviously at the cost of higher latency, And is it Asynchronous kronos? Nope? Does require clock and what's the impact then on larger Mt of clock, well that translates into higher latency. And the level of detail whether this is good enough or whether they need be formulas or something like that. Obviously is the next interesting step to talk about if we would agree that know, this type of spec sheet and and criteria would make sense. The final slide? Traffic model right a bit per cycle, time t for flow. The forwarding model is it's stayed. No. So it is stateless. What are the algorithm parameters? Right? So we just require mapping table for the forwarding What's the calculus is it published? Yes. Is it linear? Yes, it's per calculated.

That you said that in congested over provisioned environment, there is no a delay. I think that probably it will be more accurate to say there is no pic jitter. Because it basically, when you un congested and or don't the serial utilization see there is no queuing can we call it queuing delay? Yeah. So... Right. The queuing delay There is no queuing, but there is no devaluation. So basically latency exist. Please take that to the list. I think you are highlighting the importance of terminology and and that as we go forward with queuing mechanisms, we make sure we have common terminology something else to add into the criteria.

So this is the zero zero version of draft and it is an output of some simulation or the Poc we've been doing with process automation in industry control networks. We came across some limitations, and I wanted to share what those are. So we were building this platform and next slide, please. Go to this one. Yeah. So how we use industry process automation in the industry, we had Dsl networks, and you can just go ahead and configure the devices there and they interact whatever information come command process command information. Then dead net came, it's pretty much the same that you get better scalability, but you still have to configure device is in terms of flow Id to interface between rulers and field devices. So now if we look at a more progressive optimistic way that we have a cloud centric behavior where controllers could be somewhere in the cloud because they need a better compute and"

That behavior does not change. And what we are looking for is a communication between a controller and a field device pair and it is slightly different from what they net does today, which is based on flu Ids. Next slide.

It is about the traffic patterns how controllers will interface with the field devices, some of the things we want to worry about is how control loops will be implemented uses the... Using that net hub your is established. So these are the things that are already being done in terms of queuing scheduling We just want to figure out how an application can to faced with that net to provide these mechanisms next. Slide?

Next slide, please. So these are some of the country config considerations that most of the discussions are seen here or observed are based on how an operator will deploy a dent net system, but it's not talking about how application can use this data claim. For example, if it is Mp then my end device controller has to know that there is an Mp network in the system. But it doesn't work very well with the cloud based environment. If I move my application from one system to the other let's say from mp to Sr or something else then I will always have to continuously make changes in my applications and that's not very suitable. And we also need a more practical for applications to interact with the network You don't want applications to realize, okay. This is the queuing model I will to use... This is the... This is the type of algorithm I want to use in the network. You want these things to be you don't want applications to worry about these things. And then spec traffic flow is another problem that if I go from my E application, to control it and all the way down to the device, I'm losing out on end to end process automation. So we would want to eliminate that type of strict mechanism and then support different type of traffic patterns that I mentioned earlier next slide, please?

I'm just going to send an urgent message that please send this message urgently over your net I don't care what kind of queuing mechanisms or What kind of scheduling you use in your network? I want this message to be treated as an urgent delivery method. Similarly, if I have I have different kind of act in the system and each act may have different kind of bounded latency requirements in terms of when the command can be delivered. So I want to provide my latency back to the network that This is the information again, I don't care what kind of mechanism you use. So this is what we are exploring right now that can we support and extension header that encapsulates application to dead net interface And I would like to get group's feedback on it that Is this the direction we should take? Should we go ahead with this does it fit in the group or not Next slide is just covering that but this is my last slide and just looking for the feedback. So to go about this work? Okay. Thank you. Dan? Yes. Down book. So the... I agree with is that the applications should not have to understand the intricacies of that net service full agreement.

And then in industrial environment, with some of the robots they work like swarms and they get the global context compute somewhere in the cloud, to get it to a local application controller that builds it up at know, that controls is that swarm. So in this presentation that you did. You said, like, oh, here's the cloud. Here's the host. But it is not so clearly delineate. It is much more granular. And then the death net would be just supplied between the local application and devices that are under the under the control of that application. I agree with you that there are so many different kinds of scenarios and that may apply to only certain set of cases But specific scenarios I'm looking at is something like I have multiple sites of factory floors. I ruined my edge cloud to control those two sides to together and I want to control some kind of supply chain. So for that, I don't need that to be local, I can actually exchange... Extend it to my edge cloud environment. So this is this is actually a super interesting this discussion and it...
