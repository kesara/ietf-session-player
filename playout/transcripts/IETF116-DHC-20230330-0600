I'm I'm very suspicious of said situation. We're now supposed to start just summary. I've also remote people feel free to it volunteer as well. I've seen that in several groups this week. I can be helpful as well. I have it open and we'll try my best to keep an eye on them as we go along, but since I'm solo today. I won't be able to actually do them."

I did drop in the agenda and all that stuff. So it's just filling the dots underneath the presentation. Alright. Perfect. Okay. So here's the agenda. We have Lorenzo is gonna talk about sub registering self generated Ip v six addresses. Gonna talk a little bit about distributed Sr v locator. That presented earlier this we in spring. And then we're gonna talk about our favorite thing trying to get eighty four fifteen to an internet standard. Yep. Oh, Right. Document standards. Okay. So here's what we got going on. We only have one working group document at the moment. I suspect we're gonna have more after this meeting would be my guess. I think we've got a couple candidates. So we're gonna talk about all of the related stuff right now. I did throw a couple of extra related documents that are going through other working groups here just so people know what's going on. The first one is added encrypted Dns the radius update that's going through Is. S I e s g review right now.

Okay. Friends I here it. Okay. You're gonna present the slides. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Gonna Gonna do that. Okay. So this document is about registering self generated Ip six addresses using each v six. Work with the below. At least possibly one more. Next slide, So we presented this in in London and we had fair amount of feedback and we sort of essentially, you know, address the feedback. So we renamed the message. It used to be called that notification to try form, and form is more consistent with language we using D before. So some information on my in in in Before it's called D form so we felt this was better. Next slide. Several folks at the meeting and on the list suggested that, you know, we needed an act in order to, like, stop the client for me transmitting. We sort of were split on this because we thought that in general, any new server is not gonna be able to access because it won't understand it. But, you know, we thought we decided to sort of follow the feedback and say and add an act. Right? So the server can choose to acknowledge the message."

And knee client must stop pre transmitting if it gets replying. And I assume I don't know maybe of question from. I guess we don't need to say that the reply identified by the Transaction Id. That's of just basically, it's... I assume this is, you know, just send D semantics, but. Okay. Next slide. The re the... It was pointed out that the re transmit logic that we had was, like home homegrown and sort of like, we rolled our own and we sort of moved away from the we moved away from that and we sort of actually, we implemented basically similar logic with this with the our c four eighty five fourteen behavior, which does yeah. It kinda gives you ways to do exponential backups with various maximum. So So we basically say that you it'll transmitted with exponential back you know, one second, two seconds, four seconds. Jared, with a maximum, you know, try... Maximum transmit count three you transmitted one to you returns t t equals zero, t equals one t equals three and t equals seven, and that's it. And you... Unless you get an. And the client should allow these promises to be configured. Our next slide. And we added away for the client to say that it can release its address. It does this by sending an in informed message was all the lifetime set to zero. This is not generally super useful. But, you know, it's sort of it was there for completeness. And I think, you know, servers can choose to forget about it. Although the the the purpose of this is mainly forensics, so probably wouldn't beat it anyway, but Anyway, so And next slide? And"

One of the things that we also one of the things that we that current draft says is that the... Because the message comes from the Ip address that is being registered any sort of layer two snoop device can verify the correctness of the address. Because it will drop the packet if layer to security in use. And so if you start doing spoof it becomes kind of complicated and erode that guarantee. And And also, there was a request to do sort of I forgot there was a... That was basically saying, well, we should use Tcp for this because reliable and we can inform that the server of multiple things. But that also seemed like a very big step away from Standard Dhcp and we sort of didn't we didn't do that. We sort of just left it as send the D six. Next slide? So with that, we do think that most of the feedback has been addressed and we we think this is this is ready to go forward. And the next step would be to a population adoption call. And if we have there are any questions, Couple people. Go ahead eric. So everything no head over here. Just looking for router and switch vendor as you can guess. So could the switch relayed the message? I need to to read the draft right in the detail. I think is a Dhcp relay. Right? I see why not. Yeah. I mean, yes. And you spoof the message and relates I don't see why not. Yes. february. Right? I mean, I see I gave in my table right and mapping? I generate on my own. Spoof message"

So we got to database in the switch and the routers or the access point we've all the mapping, it will be so cool to export it on the stand way. Not overseas slow. I mean maybe... Yeah. I I I don't I don't particularly oppose this. I find it ironic because one of the reasons we're doing this is that people hate this, and they don't want to use it. And, you know, we've been trying to work with people to say, like, don't you just use all of this information this this features that your switches already have and they well, but we need to be in three. But, yeah, if you if you wanna solve the opposite problem, I don't know I don't know what that would mean for this drop. Should we say may, should we just leave it unspecified and then you can build your own proprietary feature item, Actually no. Any comments from anyone? Why this is a bad idea or a good idea? Or Terrible. It is not the stupid ids with the fine. Anyway. For this there's no way you can, you know, actually mandatory necessary people to stop to that because mario middle Know. Who's there. So... But as standardization document what we said, I would like to have that possibility here because you you know, the agent here is actually spared the range of Dhcp server could recover. So I would like at least leave it as may you our talking. So the... There are two issues that I've just thought Of just found just now. Which are number one, what if the client also does this?"

Well, you could argue it doesn't matter, but it actually does because the switch doesn't know what options the line would put in, for example, the F q m. And the f is one of the things where actually, we decided what we actually heard a real customer that wanted to do this. And they... Apparently, they take the F q n from D before and they stick it in Dns. And I'm like, well that. Doesn't seem like a great idea, but they... That's what they do. I they do. Yeah. So So that wouldn't... And and the sort of the the the switch that spoof this wouldn't really have any idea that the if the client was going to later on do it. And so that's would have to be sorted out to add it. Yeah. So maybe There's someone ahead in the queue, but I have... I'm responding to this sure I was kind of gonna raise the same comment. The way normally is done is that the switches don't to proactively generate stuff. Which I guess some people may have been doing to try to address the problem because the client wasn't doing anything yet. But the way this would work this is why deployed is that the switch doesn't generate its own messages, but the driver just when the message message is passed through it adds something like option eighty two or whatever. And that is a modification of the existing message from the client. And what's a new message that the speech generates. I do think the draft needs to say what exactly is snoop switches savvy, whatever else sort supposed to do with these messages, even if it is nothing. And especially, I think it's important to point out that the reply model only need doesn't mean confirmation to the client. It also doesn't mean anything get a switch in to maintaining its snoopy table for security purposes. Mh. It's also quite unusual in the sense that it goes directly.

I mean, this race can be relatively easily fixed by just waiting a while.

It shouldn't do it just in a case where hosts are updated to implement days but the server doesn't understand the draft already says that the Dsp server is required to drop that it doesn't understand.

Slightly less number of eighty four fifteen implementations, but that's what we're trying to do is is clean that up and figure out how we can easily distinguish which ones are doing the latest stuff and how many of them exist.

I mean, there were three three drafts on the slides in the on the right. So there's that I get some ways it's similar to six man, which has basically, like, in it's charter it... It it basically says, well, we're around and like, anything that touches this stuff needs to come here and, you know, we're sort of response for keeping an eye on things. And that was... I actually remember that was not That that text like, was use, you know, only a few years ago, right? You know, and and there was a discussion I should we close this? What should do? And and said we said, okay, this is kind of a stewardship thing. There's a lot more arguments there than they are here. I think this is the more sort of let's less controversial, but, you know, We also have the odd thing of a lot of working groups can do to work on our own we have the options to find.
