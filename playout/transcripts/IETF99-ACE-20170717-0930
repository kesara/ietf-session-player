    "text": "new credential fight between the client and authorization circuits the framework only defines the mapping and relies on the default account credentials next slide the DTLS draft it defines how to do the client to resource server using raw public key and pre shared key so it\u0027s very similar but it\u0027s concerned with other nodes communicating it was interesting that all of mentioned the client to OS role public key and maybe so it\u0027s it\u0027s closely related but it\u0027s concerns with the different area next slide and then the MPLS draft that defines new client credentials for x.509 certificates doing it a bit annoying in hindsight seeing the x.509 certificates used quite a lot in the wild I think it makes sense to define for role public key and pre shared key now directly and it\u0027s slightly wider sculpt and the dis dropped I think that was the last slide it could be interesting is to ask the question does this fit into the ace workgroup I think so since it very much complements the profiles and also D framework however it is pure client credentials and it doesn\u0027t refer to any other ace document so it could just as well be moved it to the off word I was working with and then I would like to just ask for feedback I\u0027ve gotten some questions and comments on it but it would be awesome to get some more comments on it create a new version and then maybe later on ask if this makes sense for adoption thank you um before I forget where\u0027s the blue sheet has everyone signed the blue sheets where\u0027s the blue sheet or did everyone sign the blue sheet okay okay you\u0027re on cylinder here it\u0027s on so I think this makes very much sense I have some questions comments yes so first of all a profile as defined previously in in this session is something that concerns the communication between the client and the and the RS yes well this is it\u0027s not not really a profile but it it deals with it\u0027s like an extension to the framework if you like I would say this is I would "
