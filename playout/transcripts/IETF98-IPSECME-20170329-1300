Els but it doesn\u0027t exist in ESP of course you can say that you\u0027re doing a modified ESP that doesn\u0027t require this alignment which is fine probably a good idea but 4303 says that you have to pad to a multiple for but then the padding is part of the because all three is a TSP it\u0027s something that the ESP does are for calling ok ok right that\u0027s the way for you feel free ok then what is here is wrong um next slide so I CD was a comment from Valerie about a icv yeah the the comment was if I CV is "
