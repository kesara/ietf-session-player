    "text": "conversation so very concise I would love more tutorials on how to use Travis circle now to build and also the beauty that HTTP base has on their github with the getup pages it\u0027s beautiful about hard to build yep sure um yeah I did a lot of working on github in w3c and it worked so fantastically I know there\u0027s problems but it\u0027s it really barley improves what you\u0027re doing and to all of Patrick\u0027s points with regards to tutorials or second that the Travis stuff would be great but just a little bit of process for some new chairs getting started I think was richard barnes and martin Thompson did a thing a while ago and I asked them after that about how to make what to name our repo and you know Pat what processes shall i do should i do one repo for the whole what a thing or a town or an organization and so those kind of things would be great right so one of the one of the outcomes of that particular one because i chaired that oh yeah was um the question about the guidance to give people versus do we need not necessarily process but do we need and you know do we need certain structures or certain rules for how people use a github to do I ETF stuff and that was left as an open question then and I do believe it\u0027s still sort of an open question up so I know some people feel like this processes might limit some things I would as a newer chair i would i would like those processes it won\u0027t matter old old chair i would like that yeah it\u0027d just be nice say this is what you should name your organization these are the people it should have access to it these kind of things just for people to get started I how do you set it up in such a way that you guarantee the transparency that we want to ensure continues without hm yeah yeah yeah anyway I\u0027m violating my own stuff Isis so Ron gondwana I just wanted to I guess counter the idea of ITF running their own git repository our own git repository and own tooling around it it\u0027s very insular compared to being on github where other people can discover it when we were talking about the website being discoverable people outside the ITF if we\u0027re using all in-house tooling it\u0027s a lot harder for people in other communities to discover oh okay and I know you\u0027re going to answer that so go ahead I don\u0027t have an answer for that I just have a counterproposal are we going to do a nice tutorial on how working groups should use Facebook it\u0027s the same thing I mean github is a third-party organization where how does this work legally I said when there\u0027s miss you I love because there\u0027s a good question on there follow mark Nottingham\u0027s document because that is the bigger picture yes like that okay I just feel there\u0027s a lot of enthusiasm and I can see why because this great tooling right there\u0027s a lot of good reason but I just want to kind of pull the reins a little bit say I think we need to think about this right more so there\u0027s been plenty reigns polling as well the one thing that I would like to emphasize on this is that the reason we\u0027re doing this is to make our document processing better and there are a wide variety of beliefs in how that happens I mean Patrick brought up a real interesting point which is if you ignored github the "

    "text": "knows nothing about the ietf that plans to come get the information that they need so a lot of the improvements there will come through the result of the website redesign the next thing that they get is a newcomer email from the secretary and the newcomer email from the secretary it gives them pointers to a number of things including things like the mentoring program and tell somewhere to sign up and those kinds of things so that the next thing that Newt that impacts newcomers is the mentoring program and this is one where you actually sign up you identify what you\u0027re interested in and the mentoring coordinators match you with which match you with somebody from the IHF community who has similar interests and you may develop you know you may just exchange one or two emails or have a conversation or you may develop a much deeper you know relationship in the sense that in a more traditional mentor type of relationship so the nature of those relationships vary depending on that the pair of people you\u0027re talking about the next thing that they would hit would be the newcomers tutorial which mike st. John\u0027s has been doing for the last couple I chest and a really nice job on that the tutorial is a has been recast a bit it\u0027s shorter than it used to be and it\u0027s it\u0027s really more about pointing you to where you need to find the things that you need to do and it\u0027s less about that the long history of the IETF that material is still all there but but the the way the newcomers tutorial is currently being defined is slightly different than that then we have the speed mentoring which we\u0027ve already we were talking about a little bit and that the real objective of this is is not so much to match people with other people specifically related on interests or working groups but basically to get folks talking to people in the IETF and and occasionally you\u0027ll make interesting connections I know I\u0027ve heard a couple stories from people this week who are very excited about being able to connect person a two-person be based on the conversation they had in speed mentoring so then the question that newcomers meet and greet is next and and Pete completely teed up the conversation about newcomers meeting greed we were having a conversation about whether this is really a useful event or not or is it really more a working group chair social and so the witch which has valid and you know a valid purpose I did also hear somebody say something about you you know refilling their glass of wine when it was free before they went to the regular reception where they had to pay for their wine so that that\u0027s another strategy for that but so we were going back and forth on what\u0027s the purpose of the newcomers meet greet and is it effective and is it meeting that purpose or not and one of the pieces of feedback that i did get which because i was leaning towards the this is not really very effective and the speed mentoring is doing more of what we actually want to do there the newcomers make great the speed mentoring is more about meeting in you know various random individuals whereas the newcomers make great is provided that you have the structure and the you know you will reach out and do this you know I\u0027m interested in this working group chair or I\u0027m interested in this "
