Harmon for instance whether we will have one or multiple absent providers whether we will use one single or multiple routers to interconnects with absent providers or whether we are using the provider independent or provider assigned prefixes in in this context and once we have you mounted all these use cases by specifics of the D multihoming then we describe the recommended behavior for each of the use cases that we have identified so far for instance if there is if we can use a unicast or not if we can plus a fork the request or we or if we have to stop it in the does client itself so basically this is just a summary of some example at least the main trends of the use cases that we can cover when we are we\u0027re dealing with multihoming I am not listening in this one the other use cases in which you have your mitigation provider it\u0027s not your own transit provider and this is a cloud hosted by in a cloud basically you have three three three flavors there which are three of them you are likely to encounter in an enterprise context and one and the the fourth one which is likely in the world that context in which you have SCP SCP which is connected to multiple and multiple domains first typically a fixed X line and the other one with a mobile element and the E and the D traders this is typically the entreprise network in which you have a multi hond you may have multiple absent providers if you want to play with your top team as your Cecily\u0027s and in industry flavors you have francis the typical one usual is in one single router or one single CP router to integrity on absent provider or if you have the using dedicated routers to interconnect to upstream sales provider so once we have identified this may flavor of having multi-home at the human we will start to see now if we enable the das service somewhere so again there will be a variety of of of scenarios there you may have all your ups observers preferences that support the dude server but you may also have only a subset of this providers who offer to do the server but whatever the scenario that would be experienced there there is a constraint that is that some of the dist servers that will be available in this absent providers may not be "
