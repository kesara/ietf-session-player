I'll do the second one first So we now have sent 4960 sorry, that that says 4169, it is in fact 4916, John Elwell's classic draft on having identity work in the backwards draft says 4169. It is in fact 4916, John Elwell's classic draft on having identity work in the backwards direction for the original RFC 4474 that is post working up gas calls now pub rack as I did manage to clean up the innumerable irrelevant references that were cluttered in the back of it and sorted those properly into normal"

And for those of you who have no idea what this document is, this is a revision basically to an earlier specification that was RFC 88 in this. I think we long ago agreed here. And for those of you who have no idea what this document is, this is a revision basically to an earlier specification that was RFC 8816, first defined the out-of-band architecture for STR. And it was informative and kind of loosey-Googley and frameworky and like you could do it this way, you could do it that way But it did have in it like a rest flow that determined like, okay, if you have a passport and you're concerned that that passport is not going to reach the terminating side because there might not be end end step in the middle, then you can kind of store a copy of it up in web service and the term terminating side can go check when it receives a call that does not have such a passport in-band to see if there's why not a band And if it looks like it matches the call, you can go with it Pretty cool. The rest, system we defined for that was like okay but you know we did put in a little like line at the end of it that said yeah, and, you know, if you really want to do a complete special of this, you should probably like do some more work later So service provider OOB does not actually do that work What it basically does is it says, let's do a down rep and for those not familiar with this in IETF parlance, a down ref is when you have an RFC that is standards track that is relying on an RFC that is informative, normatively And like that's kind of a no-no, but you can call it out in the IA relying on an RFC that is informative normatively and like that's that's kind of a no-no but you can call it out in the IETF last call for it and if people are cool you can go forward with it. The argument I'm making is basically the specification is probably sufficient for that rest interface in order for it to go forward And the tack I proposed for this is to figure out a way to specify what is mandatory to support in the case that you're doing this service provider OOB use case, and then what isn't And the reason why I want to leave it kind of loosey-Googley like that is"

It could be a subscription where then ultimately you say I want any passports for this set of numbers or these set of resources to come down to me. And so what I pitched to our distinct AD, who I invited us toindusk, you know, was something along the lines of we'll specify it's like mandatory to implement effectively the rest interface that's in our 8816. And then we'll have like, may-ish stuff for what that's subscribed interface that we haven't specified yet might look like. What I don't want to do really is just close the door on this and say the only way you're going to do this is with like gets and posts, right? And because there do seem to be some other potentially more useful ways to cast this. And I owe you a mail about this I know but just from that description, that's kind of what I have in mind, right? And I think probably the description that's in 8816 is, like, sufficient for that simple get-and-post-disc I just want to be able to must that out, say must implement that. But like, you know, you could also implement a subscription interface in order to receive these things on, you know, more of a polish or more of a pushish situation on the terminating side If I did that roughly, does that sound? cool? Does that sound not cool? I know you just walked in and like yeah, yeah All right, or he still respond that sound not cool? I know you just walked in and like, yeah, yeah. All right, orie steele, responsible area director So there was a couple back and forth points in our email over the document I think the main concern that I had with the normative reference to the rest interface is it says sort of at the bottom doc, this is a is there enough there for, uh,"

Do people think this is kind of close enough? to what we discussed in last call that it would be cool if we went forward with this. And I don't know if people here have strong, feelings about that either way So this has been speaking from the front We did do a call for objection on that down ref when we promoted this document to standards track. Yes, we did have that discussion. Now, that doesn't mean we were right You know, certainly if we think we need to do something different, that's great. This is more if I, if we took the more substantive material about the rest interface and and kind of jam that into uh search provider OB, right? like this would that require us to come back here for another last call or do you think we can proceed with that?

Next slide Okay, thank you actually three slides. There is a slide that says next steps after this, but like the meat of the slide is simply this presentation All right, so we've done a bit of work in the past couple of months to try to get our freshness drafts all up to date. So what are the freshness drafts? Basically, we looked at a couple of different approaches to being able to ascertain that structure to try to get our freshness drafts all up to date. So what are the freshness drafts? Basically we looked at a couple of different approaches to being able to ascertain that certificates are actually fresh It doesn't work quite the same way as it does for in traditional PKI because we added in RFC 8826 a little bit of extra spice to these and you know, there is an inherent dinet it does for in traditional PQI because we added in RFC 8826 a little bit of extra spice to these. And, you know, there is an inherent dynamism to number assignment. People are familiar with things like number portability and of course you know just numbers get activated and deactivated all the time and so when you talk about credential having the authority to sign for a big block of numbers, exactly how you manage that and figure out is this certificate valid for this particular number? at any given time as a relying party when a call comes in can be tricky and so we end up with two approaches doing this with the online certificates status protocol of CSP and as well with short-lived certs and we endlessly spun around the Maypole of like, is one of these better than the other? Like, can we only do one and these and we ultimately ended up with the notion that no they probably both have their place and indeed even more so than letting the market go ahead and shake this out we think there may be niches in which"

Next slide So what's new? So there's a zero-eight version of OCE now. We now have examples of the request and response and actually use the 8826 extension in it. Previous ones did not. I would like to give my thanks to my co-author, sean turner, and to our esteem co-chair, Wes Hausley, for their assistance and getting those things up to date. No way I could have done that myself trying to hack that out like, you know, with open SSL on my Linux box One little note about that you know, it was pointed out that we use examples that have dot CER as the suffix for certificates that are in this document And really that's not quite true because the way that X-by view communicates your certificates, you're going to find is actually in PEM and like this is not an appropriate suffix to use for PEM certificates. However, when I started looking under the hood, and this is back to Chris and I years and years ago, we use dot CER in everything in 8224 and 8225 and all the coasters stir specifications, every extension, because we just like row one example, right, of the jot header for this and just copy, pasted it forever And I'm just not sure this document is the place to set the record on this matter. And so for the moment, I am keeping it in honestly I suspect it is hard hard-coded in a lot of implementations of stirr that are out there which is more than a few at this point And like, you know, let's not suggest that they have to change or break something to be compliant with them way that we're doing OCSP. But with this, I think probably our OCSP story is complete as long as no one is really going to yell about us keeping in the example of stat.c.r suffix think probably our OCSP story is complete as long as no one is really going to yell about us keeping in the examples that dot CER subjects. Anybody going to yell about that? It's like kind of wrong, but man, we've, it's been kind of wrong for like 10 years"

And at last after I don't know how many versions of this I've been kicking around draft Peterson IETF search short be good ship. And at last, after I don't know how many versions of this I've been kicking around, Draft Peterson IETF search short-lived has become a working group item and is now back at zero zero. And we did a bit of work in this to make sure that we got x5c basically correct so what do I mean by that so traditionally in stir you use x5 u in the jot header to signify the certificate that was responsible for signing this passport. Very handy You don't have it already. You just go download it from that HPSU URL. Use it to validate the passport But a lot of the promise of using short-lived is that in fact we will be pushing the certificates by value instead through a separate jot header that is called x5c And X5C has support for, as the C suggests, a change of certificates that will appear there and we did this time actually from the TransUnion implementation. I have them make a valid example of how X5C should look in this with the RFC 8226 extensions in it we did in response to some of the comments we got last time we have some text now that allows both x5c and X5U to be present. And this is largely for backwards compatibility. We just fear there are so many Sturr implement that use X5U and that really only support that, that it may take a while to get people like up to speed on X5C So like right now, we're kind of like, yeah, you could have both if you really wanted to. But a question arose on the list just the other morning pointing out that, you know, X5C is not currently a must"

So let's discuss a bit about whether X5C should in fact be a must in this. Jonathan, since you raise it, please Jonathan Rosenberg from 5-9 I don't think it's a backward compatibility problem because it's not saying that all stir implementations must do this, it's just saying one's compliant to this specification must do this So like, I don't see a problem with having this at must strength for this document, right? Okay like you said, it's like pretty much useless with that it, so. I mean, you know if you should is waffled, waffily waffley like pretty much useless without it, so. I mean, you know, it should is waffled. Useless is a strong word. It will still work with X-5 Right. And it does not accomplish, it does not accomplish the purpose. It does not accomplish the data minimization goal, which is maybe perhaps the main one, right And yes, you get a performance hit from it But at the same time, it provides a way that it's easy to manage short lived certain for cases where, for example, you want to keep an enterprise, like on a short leash"

OK still can provide value without that, right? Because right now, there's really no- So if it's used selectively, for example. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. But I'm not wed to this.

Maybe you should go first Yeah, I can go So I just wanted to clarify you're talking about must for a verification service to support X5C, right? No, I'd think this is much more a must for authentication service Even authentication? Must use? Yeah must use. I'm pretty supportive of must, so. Of a must use I just wanted to ask that question. Okay i just wanted to ask that i wanted to ask that question okay yeah i that was part of the point that we went down this road was to not have the double transaction Yes. Yeah. Okay.

I mail of that mailing list about this at one point, and I just remember now, what would Alec want to talk about? Yes, that's exactly it.

I mean, but even broader than that, I can see the argument that like, look, like, if you trust the root, you already have it, even outside of shape, in any conceivable deployment environment for this, if you trust the route, you probably have a copy of the route already. And if you don't, there's like something even more weird and nefarious going on here right So ultimately yeah, that's probably reasonable um there probably i mean it's looking at the size of the x5c example that they put in that that is a lot of bytes that are there to deliver that root service I mean, in TLS, like, the web server, when you're doing it, set up TOL handshake, you send the end entity and any immediate you do not send the route. It's just in broad TLS on the internet. The assumption is the client has the route um i think Yeah, so why did, because, you know, I just stole this from 7519 right? And like the 7519 example works this way, which is why we built our example look just like 7519 did so does anybody remember I'd be curious to ask I don't I don't know. I really don't know why anyone would do that Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't think of any reason Yeah, it might be worth our time to actually ask those guys like why it works that way if there is like some particular reason they had to want the root syrup to be in there for X5C. But, but I think in general principle I like I'm on board. Let's just double check that and make sure that like we aren't missing something sounds good i was just going to say i thought in general having the route or not having the route was, is always generally supported supported And, you know, if you want to get your if you want it if you want your certificate to be valid"

Alex, Alex, I don't know come back. It was not related to the must, so I'll come back after that. So what this is related to- remember, vanilla passports, RFC 82-25 passports only use X5U. So we're at adding X5C as like a new feature. The purpose of this new feature, is people can convey certificates by value more or less entirely for the case where a short-lived search are being issued by intermediate CA so it will be a three cert change, right?"

Yeah, this is not a change to baseline shaking operations of like this is a change to this very narrow Delegate certificate case for shaken okay right i was going to uh actually expand on that a bit the baseline shaken implementation entirely uses SBC's not TN And this is for the new part of Shaken that may someday use TN That's not anything to be backwards compatible with We have, by the way, we have a couple of nos does anyone want to uh numbers don't add up i have a couple of nose do anyone want to defend the no position? Hi, Ben, this is first Go ahead, I like. Pierce Alec.

But if I'd expand on that like, why shouldn't it be must for shaken, hypothetically, in the sense of the point of doing this by value is, again, to eliminate those RTTs, right, and to make it so as soon as a request appears the relying party is able to ascertain whether or not it's verifiable.

I think that's a problem in the sense that we want X5C to be on possible and shaken You know, there's short-lived certs kind of from this document and then there's just people using certificates following all the existing documents that have existed for years that are on the short there's short-lived certs kind of from this document and then there's just people using certificates following all the existing documents that have existed for years that are on the short-lived side. And there would be an advantage if people could start using X by C today So I don't really know how this all interrupts, but I do think it'd be nice if we could get X-5C optional That does kind of making, it needs to be a must on the VS side though which to Pierce's point, you know, that's a problem and but on the flip side i i would I would say, you know, the solution is to have x5c in there x5 u as well I don't know, but I don't think this has any impact on shaken because it does reference these documents, this document"

Well, no, but I just meant the current document doesn't reference this. Addison doesn't seven 80, like those documents don't reference this So if you make this must now, it doesn't just immediately change it and but i'm kind of saying that in a bad way we Addison Delt's 80 doesn't reference this document So I think Addison, or RFC 82 is it that I'm thinking of? The base passport doesn't allow X-5 allow X5C if I recall and that's really the core issue here not so much like adding it here doesn't help you if you in another document say you can't use it and because you don't want to get rid of that reference yeah but we we occasionally, I understand, things kind of trickle down you know we put out an rfc and at us like may do something as a result they're not forced to but that that would be the idea I think But Chris? It's a, I guess, one last comment I'll just say, it's a little funky with like shake inserts because I don't think we're saying all shake inserts are shortly so it doesn't make sense to say you have to use an x5c from authentication If you're using a long-lived cert, it would be dumb to use an ex X5C, right? You're adding a whole bunch of bytes But if you're using short-lived certs that are shaken certs, so you kind of get in this situation where what your lifetime of your cert, the same, you know, shaken certs in the same environment If they're shorter-lived certs, you probably prefer X-5C. If they're longer subserts, you probably prefer X5C you. Yeah. And to be clear, there is no intention of having this must apply to anything other than short-lived certs. What's the short-serts? Yeah, and to be clear, there is no intention of having this must apply to anything other than short-lived certs. That may not have been in the vote, right? What's the short? cert? Yeah, I get it, but Oh, that's the problem, right? Well, that is an added problem"

That is not an idea problem i can tell you that right well i think I think it, but it's exempt It's not like Yeah, I was going to ask another question, but just to comment on that last point like I think that was the point of this shortly like this is a specifically separate technique a specifically separate tool that we want in the tool bag, you know, because you use 8220, because you use X5U, that might have a short lifetime that doesn't, that's not the same as what this document's talking about My question was, going to be do we know i guess i could have looked it up while we were having that other discussion, but do we know in JWT, can you have an X5C and then? next five you? Can you have multiple? and what happens if they pointed they described two different certificates and like some of those issues may want to just double check on that. Yeah, I mean I did look at 7519 on this and I don't recall it saying you couldn't have both but we should double check, obviously. And yeah, the question of which you would rely on in that instance is an interesting one if the contents are not identical I can imagine a lovely attack at surface that opens up from that, can't I? Good forensics. Jonathan Rosenberg, 590 There is actually a backwards compatibility promor related to X5U though, right, which is if the AS doesn't know if the VS supports this extension and the VS only looks, then you have an older one that doesn't support X5C at all whether or not the X5C is must or should, the real thing is the X5 you must always include the X5U if you put the X5C or not the X5C is must or should, the real thing is the X5U must always include the X5U if you put the, if you're using this draft and you put the X5C in So that comes back to this question of like, if you can't have both, we have a problem"

So my point is like, if we agree to do much for X5C, the document has to say you must still include the X5U for backward compatibility So that would be a change we have now. Now it is optional to do that to also include the X5C view like am i missing something right i mean like well, I mean, yeah, the result would just be very verification fails, like, if it's unsupported, but like you know, verification may fail for being unsupported if you don't already have, like, enough sauce that, yeah, yeah Well, I'm just saying even if your Xbox U delivers you a certificate chain like that if you don't support, you know so well it should work all right so what i'm taking away from this is we should probably be looking at must for both and that with must for both we need to do as I hope jonathan hui noting a little bit of study of 7519 to make sure that that is in fact legit and if not what it would take to allow us to do that Hopefully not having to specify our own new header called X5 schmoo we've done worse All right, so x dash x5 Okay, I'll take a look at night look.

But it seems like it would be really nice if we could kind of have a way to I mean, I almost, you want an embed end entity cert and a referenced in a intermediate for some deployments because the intermediate are long-lived certs, very long-lived and it's too complicated, but it seems just so silly to put the same intermediate in millions in millions and millions of these passports Yeah, I mean, again, I about this in shaken term right, where we imagine it is the job of the PA to make sure that all relying parties have those root certs. Is it whose job? is it in shaken? This question for you guys, I guess, to make sure that, or is there a job indeed needed? to make sure that like you know who the intermediates are And, you know, if, let me see, again because what this leads to is like okay I need to go fetch the intermediate cert if I don't already know it and I'm going to use x5U for that right? And then, like, rely on the EE cert that is in the X5C Is that what you're talking about? Devin, that's a potential implementation. But, yeah, you know, you're right. You don't pre-hap the intermediates but it's you let's say you have x5 x5 u and from a shaken perspective we're added standards are actually very specific.

I mean, I'm just worried again about multiple intermediaries and like change of these things and, you know I agree. It's complicated It's probably not worth it.

Probably. I'm about to do some engineering at the microphone. So since we already concluded that when the X5C is present, you have to have the X5U anyway, right? therefore have the intermediate chain by reference from the X5U. So you could specify that the X5C only contains the leaf yes that's it uh rest explain to me again how sort of certification paths are constructed if you only have an end entity, and there is arbitrary and intermediaries between you and a route that you trust and that may in fact include different paths that cover multiple intermediaries and you're building a certificate path it works the SKI will tell you which one As long as they don't have the same public key, you're safe So you'll, you can always, if you just have the SKI, in the E, you can always use that to get the entire certification path back.

But if the SKI is always going to take you let you build the entire certification path backwards, just from the EECERT, then there's not a security problem there So the attack that you were postulating is that the, X5U and the X5C must have the same leaf cert in them, otherwise that isn't true So there's really three months Jonathan, you're getting all this isn't true so there's really three months Jonathan you're going to know this so the third must is that you know the X5U and the X5C must have the same EE cert in them. Yep may be that there's more than one valid certification pattern that could be built backwards from the EECC to the root, but that's- where I was going, right? Like, but the SKI will always lead you to what the path needs to be to construct that backwards This is always the devil of these things with like, because it can end up, you can end up with all these weird parallel configurations where this can actually go to two routes for example, like because of like cross cross-certification and things like that and like shaken but no lawa like yet, yeah yet doesn't allow it myself.

So the thought is really behind trying to make sure that we go we have all the tools available that to make in particular, I think delegates certificates with Tien's trust because somebody may want to claim a TN that they're not authorized to claim I think that's a big threat factor.

So I think as I said, we abandon the first attempt we had was to try to align with RFC-91-62 but we sort of abandoned that and like I said, became much more prescriptive, much more opinionated about how we think this would work in based on how stir certificates are generally created and the pathways that they take We define a different and specific API for submission of law API for submission of logs, getting SCTs, and how you monitor so querying the logs so that you can check We also abandoned and specific way of defining a specific appendal logs.

Is that something that you're trying to prohibit the monitor would flag? with that? Or is this something where really you know, again, it's kind of up to the relying party to say, okay, it turns out if I look at the log, there are a number of different entities that all have certificates for this single originating number.

Or kind of how do you see that? working for that kind of edge case yeah I think that a great question actually um in the log. Right. Or kind of how do you see that working for that kind of edge case? Yeah, I think that's a great question, actually. I don't want to prevent, you know, the ability to have multiple delegate certificates for the same TN I think the onus in general and people can correct me if they have different interpretation, but the onus is on the one that cares about the telephone number to do the monitor or have the monitoring happen on their behalf to make sure that they are aware if there's this new certificate that gets created with their telephone number, is that something that they initiated or they? are aware of versus it's coming from somewhere else and is a misissued? certificate?

We know in practice it seems much more likely that each of these OSPs are going to clamp it down, right?

Yeah, sure So if I am creating certificate using certificate transparency, I want to make sure that all the verification service check to see if there's a SET receipt there Otherwise, it should I would want that very verification to fail. Sure, but the problem is if a malicious actor is sending, has created this bad certificate and is there for not using transparency, they're going to opt out of sending the SCT and how does the verifying server differentiate those two cases?

And in the draft, we also added that if you wanted to check inclusion, prove and that more time-consuming things, you could run it as a background process optionally but there's presence of the SCT and the passport would be the thing and I think you are initial question was about backwards compatibility when they don't have that SCT and what happens so this could be in my personal opinion either your verifier says, I'm good, I can accept this because I'm to speak with this stuff and don't drop it, but the very your verifier says, I'm good, I can accept this because I'm to speak with this stuff and don't drop it, but the verifier that is updated and now says, okay, I'm introducing all new level of verification against the first you know, I'm going to actually pay attention to that and take it from there and I brought to that that and take it from it. So this conversation is like shockingly similar to the one we just had on X-Fi C and F5B. Right. So what I sort of just heard is that the transference in the passport is merely an optimization of bits, right? to avoid retrieving it over and over again on the receiving side, just like we were talking about for short-lived certs, right?

It's somewhat similar, but it's kind of different But to your point about the question you had, earlier, you know, with global rollout yeah, this is a hard problem. I can tell you how the web world did it Google Chrome said effective this date, if your cert doesn't have certificate transparency it's not going to be trusted. And that force everyone to do things quickly. There's really not a way to do it otherwise.

In fact, I know almost nothing. So this may be stupid comments, but like I would expect something like okay, if you're a verifier and you're implementing this, right? and the passport shows up and there is no SCT in it, then you go to the log and you get it And if it's there, great. And if it's not there, it's fraudulent. Right? Isn't that what we want? Too slow. The log is not intended to get the receipt. It's intended to be a public way that you verify monitoring as certificates are getting created to see is somebody misissuing one that's using my telephone number or my SPC or whatever it's an it's supposed to be an offline process versus an online process in terms of calls.

I believe those are two different certificates One, the end entity has the SPC the other one the intermediate has the SPC, and the end entity is the telephone number Right, but both of those because you transparent And if the delegate cert is used to sign a passport, what's in the SCT claim of the passport? passport? The CT for, because you need, you want both. You need, let's say the delegate and entity cert, the delegate cert, the end entity cert is put into two logs so there's two S SCTs and then the intermediate cert the shaken cert is put into two logs so there's four SCTs you need to transmit. I don't think you want to just put them all in one array because you need to know which goes with which I think both of those certificates would be used to sign two different passports and would have two different SCT"

Next slide just defining sort of things that correspond to the three-party movement so the vetting agent, the one that actually issued the tokens and does the actual vetting the vetting entity that wants to be represented themselves They act as the holder in the three-party model and then the vetting verifier that actually wants to bat validate that you are who you say you are Next slide I think I saw of covered a lot of this already so we can go to the next slide So there's a number of examples that I put in here obviously one of the big things and this sort of, I always refer back to the CADA working group that said you need to do two main things, you need to do KYC and vet an entity, but you also need to make sure that they are associated with the right to use that telephone number So I see that as probably the key use case here, but there is room for a lot of other interesting information about that entity that we can put in there I put business IDs in the exam room for a lot of other interesting information about that entity that we can put in there. I put business IDs in the examples, I put Rich Call Data in there"

John? I followed the pattern from the SDJOT thing where the input claims that get vetted are this could be an example. So I said like RCD is in there, business IDs are in there the telephone number array of telephone numbers but potentially, the business name, the contact that's associated the author contact that's associated with that business"

No, I'm done I'm done. Yeah, so I guess one question I had about this up front So definitely I get why we need something that has this property and communicates this information and I was super interested to read actually about selective disclosure, which I had not read about before as a capability in JOTs And like, I can, I've long believed that we were going to reach a point where we needed some kind of like encryption within passports because there are going to be things that are going to be sensitive, like geographical information, for example that you know it would be great to be able to restrict in terms of who was able to access those As we know, these passports just kind of get thrown over the wall, right? from the originating side, it can go, who knows where or they end up at the terminating side and like the tenant recipient and all the information that's in this basically clear text, right? But, you know, when I look at this, I mean, a lot of the properties, especially when we're talking about KYC and like the, and for those not familiar with this, this idea of know your customer, this is parlance that is used broadly in the I'd say that the superset of systems that have been built on top of stir shaken as stir shaken has rolled out to represent instances where there are entities that go through a process, some kind of a due diligence to ascertain who the identity of person really is behind a telephone number and they want to have a way to be able to express that, maybe a limited way"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "01:16:02",
    "text": "that involves selection disclosure, but they at least need to know it so that we can get around precisely the kinds of problems I was discussing earlier where if it enterprises you know, sending its calls out through multiple originating services providers that aren't the people that issued them the time telephone number they are using as their calling number having a relationship between who the OS is and the enterprise that's sending a call seems super important. But like because of the relatively static nature of this information, in other words, this is an information that's like about the call. It's about like in any entity behind it. Right. I was always vaguely envisioning that we're going to go down this past, we would do it in the certs that all this information would actually be part of the X509 that like is in the delegate cert that we issue to these entities because it doesn't need to be part of the way at a passport level that we tag this information on a per call basis. It's instead fundamental security information about who the entity is that's originating the call it's relatively long-lit, it's not not terribly dynamic, it may have a lot of this kind of metadata in it, right? And so I guess my first question is, kind of did you consider? that as an alternative to approaching this through a job and kind of what do you think to treat up? are there between those approaches? So I actually I started the same place but that's maybe the nature of that we've been talking a lot about certs and and things like that I think really at the end of the day, it's against container and maybe there's others can come in more comprehensively than I can on some of these things but but I think adopting the framework that's being discussed is actually a big part of this as well in terms of like the three. We should get to the framework in a minute. I know jonathan flat to talk about the framework a bit, but just from a, you know, modularity and division of where the assert security associations are, who"

    "text": "forms them and why, right? Like the notion that this is half happening as a part of like call process on a per call basis that this information gets added to what appears in the passport seems to me like it's it's the well it's a counterintuitive place for that kind of information to end up being associated with the parties that are making calls so i i don't believe i put too much opinion into how that actually gets added, but this definitely is not, this is not a per call It's either referenced or included per call, but it's definitely not being created necessarily well well I guess be created per call that depends how it being in the job stronger. My point is, at least the- kind of information you're talking about here seems much more like the way you enroll people into the security into the PKK to start with, right, is figuring out we betted them and they, this is their address and this is their business ID, their EIN or like that that's all stuff I would imagine happening at the point that a delegate certificate, for example, is being issued to an entity that's going to make calls so I think So why doesn't that work? To me, the certificates associate with the ability to sign passports are different than the authority that a better is given to be trusted by a very verification service. I think those are two related but orthogonal concepts and that's why I kept them separate Or I think we should keep them separate. Quick time check. There were 10 minutes left in this working group meeting This is also a topic that we could talk for a long time about as well"

Yes absolutely Rob Shiva, thank you for the comments That's actually to guide some of the updates on conversation You've got to get a lot closer to the mic microphone. Yeah Still, okay, sorry. And that may idea, I think, about the Vesper token is to create sort of like a standard way of sharing KYC, KYB information because a lot of people use different companies for VAS vetting and so on, and it would be nice to have for this ecosystem away to say, well, you can continue using whoever you want and so on, but then express it in some common way. And the SDJ also gives us a nice property of, you know, issuer common way. And the SDJAD also gives us a nice property of, you know, uh, issue or holder verifier. So in turn, in case of delegates, we can actually, you can have a situation where vetting entity can go to vet you can have a situation where vetting entity can go to vetting agency or call center and so on and then just receive this token that can be used further for the for the center and so on and then just receive this token that can be used further for the calls that they do and they can just do this on their behalf so that's kind of where I think this Yeah, I think there's also a interesting property using selective disclosure that per call you may want to disclose different things to depending who you're calling"

The idea of using transparency service in there is that, you know, someone doesn't just claim that they did this and did that vetting and so on on Yeah, I mean, and to me, obviously the interesting part about making sure people don't just claim they do this these are the kinds of things I typically would associate with the enrollment into a peak This question of whether it needs to be different in a per call basis, this is the kind of thing I think that helps make decisions about what the right place to stage this is in So understanding those requirements a lot better, I think would help clarify for me anyway why this is the right path versus doing this in the search themselves i would say of course there is a tremendous amount of flexibility available next five X-509 as well for these things. And, you know, for indeed using indirection and similar mechanisms to make sure that not every who is accessing the X-509 service access to all the information that's in it but like, yeah, at the end of the day, we probably do need a broader list discussion around this to get at what the fundamental kind of requirements are around it. I know I just feel more comfortable when I think about what the job of the very very very service is and indeed what the job is of somebody like an immediate CA issuing a cert to an enterprise I want them to be doing this work as part of that and I want what their perception is of who this enterprise is and things like that to be part of what they be into it, because presumably they're the people on the hook and at the end of the day if there's a you know security failure if there's fraud or something the issue of the certificate is the person who's holding the back right, for the behavior of that enterprise And that's why, you know, this depending on what our threat model is and what kinds of things we"

    "text": "think might arise, that's, that's why my intuition would be that that's the proper place to stage a lot of this It could be there's a smaller role for selective discretion that is, you know, in the past itself. And like I said, I've envisioned for a while there should be a way to do encryption and passports. And the stuff that's per call might go to that, but like the more fundamental, hey, I vetted this entity, or this business, here's their, this is there E-E-I-N and like all this kind of stuff. That seems to me like enrollment into the PKI phase Jonathan Rosenberg, 5-9. So this whole conversation, sort of reveals to me what is my main comment which is this is just missing a framework for how we intend to overlay this in the real world and use it Like, is this for call processing? Is this for validated? enrollment? Who are the actors in the system that are using these? things? It's very meta on just reading of the document Like, there's verifiers, and there's issues, and there's veterans. Who are these? people? What decisions are these carriers? or these CAs? It's like, it seems like what is it we're trying to solve with this? thing? Even the question of whether it's a call time or not question is just an indicator that we're missing that framework. So that would be my feedback is like, it seems like it there's like some giant picture of the whole system of different actors and an ecosystem that's like in your head or something. And we zeroed in on this little interesting crypto part of the problem, which is like missing this other big picture. And it's just hard to reason about fundamental questions like this without that big picture. I would- Write a framework big picture. And it's just hard to reason about fundamental questions like this without that big picture. I would agree. I would agree that not everything is there. I think there's a lot hard to reason about fundamental questions like this without that big picture I write a framework I would agree that you know not everything is there I think there's a little more than what you said but I try to incorporate some actors and things like that but I do agree like that that's some of the discussion that I had hoped to have, and not just"

Pierce Cool. So, again, almost the last word. But Chris will have the last word I'm going to add one to Jonathan Rosenberg's comments and to jon peterson because they're both saying something similar, which is, well, one thing is you need a framework and the other is a lot of this information you want to be able to use it at call time, but you wouldn't want it communicated in the call except maybe as a reference that you would download and parse and understand just like you would a x5-09 security certificate certificate I was curious of just the select closure jot and not a more broad look at what was being done in the W3C for verification credentials, which is where I think this, you know, came from originally where the concept would be if you want to learn about the identity and some truck attributes about that identity, you could find those in a decentralized identifier document And that could be referenced from an X, that that could be a reference within an extension in the X5 and 9 Curator certificate. So I'll just say, I agree with the framework, whether you do, you know, whether you would improve what the W3C is put for their framework on how to verifiable credentials, verify all presentations, etc But I really like the you're working on this, Chris.

If it's a logo So we wanted to make sure we had a mechanism to pass the integrity hashes along with that.
