Actually, we did a lot since last version. based on the discussion we had in in Yokohama, We also included the protection of the header The reason for that is simple. if you protect the integrate integrity of the IIM data fields, and and and and and the header is changed on on the path. the integrity is kind of pointless in that case.

Pit 0 is excluded because it's the overflow flag, and it's to be modified on the path, so you don't wanna include it in the signature. and the bit 4 bit 3. Sorry. The last one is not defined yet, so you don't wanna have it in the signature. And, obviously, you have also the choice type included in the signature. For the proof of transit, you would include the namespace ID and the a proof of forensic type. and just to edge. Actually, you have to hold header. next one.

And we also added a section in INA. that says a document defining a new IOAM integrity protected option type must define the diagram option type header fields involve in the integrity protection of IOM data fields. So it may sound a little bit ugly, but, actually, this is the way we found to make sure that new integrated protected or solution type. we define also the headers field to be included So We delegate everything. to their to to to each draft, specifically. next slide. So how it works? Well, the edge to edge option type is quite easy. So here, you have the a cap on the a cap node that signed header fields and its data fields. And there is no transit not involved in this option type. So, basically, did they cap note with only check the signature of the the ACAP node to make sure that the integrity is fine. For the parts, the ACAP node would sign the header fields and its data fields. So just, like, for H2H. But in that case, the cumulative field is excluded, just because it's modified by transit nodes. And for that of some type, transit nodes would only modify the cumulative field. So, basically, it's like saying that the node we don't do anything for for the integration. So, basically, it doesn't update the signature, and so the day cap node just like for the H2H only check the signature of the end cap node. Next slide.

Otherwise, an attacker could modify the header on the path and change the actions a node performs. what it means is that for decks, for instance, you don't want transit notes to trigger and send telemetry data upstream. if it's not coming from the ACAP node, for instance, or if the data, the header was modified. And this is actually the same for the trace option type. only if the loopback or the active mode is enabled. So, basically, if for instance, look back issues. You don't wanna trigger and send back your packet with Telematics data if it's not coming really from from Jacob note. x like this. So just like I explained for the decks, the end cap node would sign the header fields, and if any data fields, so remind I remember the what I talked about Charlie in the in the slides. where we have optional date data fields. And here, each transit node would check the signature of the encapsulating node. and so that they can node would do the same as A transit node, actually. the trace option type, For it's a little bit complicated. So the end cap node would sign the header fields and its data fields. But here, If the loop back or the active mode is used, transit node will have to check the signature, but the signature is actually a shame of signature in that case because this is how the trace working. Okay? So it will have to check the whole chain up to itself. then each one is not science. It's data build as well. and the decaf node would check the signature machine. So it's the worst case I mean, from a performance point of view, if you have back or the active mode in that case because h node would have to check the whole shank up to itself.

Cool. Cool. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, I guess, we could do a show of hands like we've done for the other ones of Have you read this document? Alright. Cool. Got it. Bye. 5. which is good. And so so, Christophe, we will get one more update, and then we'll do plus call or no? Sounds sounds good to me. Also, I guess, you know, regard regarding the the RPM community, cool stuff and, you know, perfectly fine if if you have interesting outputs of that, find to bleed over into the IPPM list if there are things that you wanna report to broader group you know, the working groups exist on the mailing lists. that's, you know, where they mainly happen. So I think it'd be great to see any outcomes or Yeah. Even just yeah. This the same invite that you're doing here go out to the list so that people are more aware of that and can get involved have more crosstalk between the communities. Yeah. Absolutely. Alright.

I'll go through sort of a the motivation for the work, the design goals that we've been trying to work. to achieve. And then the solution that we pose an example on the implementation status. again, it's like this. Okay. So the motivation is basically that I mean, users consume applications, not networks. and network quality metric Therefore, needs to somehow reflect the quality of the applications running over the network. and That's what we're trying to do. So next slide, please. and finding out how well the applications work. is challenging. It's complicated. many reasons for that. There are bunch of different properties of networks, I mean, bandwidth latency, idle latency, latency in the load. working latency, all kinds of metrics that you can the can use, And then networks are complex. There are many technologies involved. And then the application side as well is complex. There are Layers on layers. of of of optimizations to deal with the the underlying variability and complexity. And then she sort of top it all off. User experience is is complex as well because subjective and of all users agree on the same thing. So this is just to say that"

Okay. So next slide, please. Okay. So the design goals we've been been trying to work towards is to make a quality metric that will be used flow for the applications, the users, and the operators of the network. at the same time. And these stakeholders have different considerations for what they what they need from a a a a a quality metric, basically. Next slide, please. The end users primarily need something that's understandable. it needs to mapped to the actual application outcomes. and it needs to be honest and objective. You need to get the same result every time. And I think there are several good metrics that that are understandable for for end users. Certainly, RPM is is one of them. And I think the So qualtoadcommetric is complementary to that. k. So next slide, please. Now from the application side, They also need the metric to be objective. And they needed to be basically a a good way to assess whether or not an application will work well over a given that Like, if the network can pro produce this level of quality, then I know that my application will work. well over that network."

And I would argue that a very useful property in to move in that direction is to have metrics that are composable. So that's why we're basing our proposal on the quality attenuation work from the program forum. where they define a network metric that is is basically a way to and I'll I get you in more detail later, but It's a way to describe latency distributions, and they are compostables. You can measure one segment and then another segment. You can add them up to basically get the the results for the the and to end. Next slide, please. Okay. So these are just links. for your convenience. Next slide, please. And, yeah, so this is the program forum. standard tr452 And or QED, use the the a recognizable word, I think.

Yeah. So this is the the one that best shows what we're actually proposing. So qualto.com as we define it in the draft. is basically you can you can provide a list of percentiles And then for each of those present presentiles, you say This is Perfect. So if if the network provides latency percent percentile that is better than this. I don't care how much better it is. It's just this is Basically, if the network is better than this, other factors is is what determines the user experience. So that's why the Qual of outcome equal hun equals 100 is on the left side in this spot. is basically it's a it's specifying when the network starts to even affect the application. And then on on the other side, on the right side, we have bunch of zeros. And that's basically the the the threshold for uselessness. So this at this point, if if the Latency is this bad or worse? I basically consider the network. or the the application performance to be useless. We We say that yeah, we don't really care about how much worse than that it gets.

So you get 80. or so. further quote to outcome score. And Yeah. Let's do questions right away if you Yep. Yeah. Martin do Google. I I guess I don't understand why there's 3 different 0 to 100 lines here. Like, isn't there a latency that is perfect for the are these 3 different applications, or are they the same application. No. So the the way we define it in the draft is that you can you can basically supply an arbitrarily large list of percentiles. Okay. -- with these thresholds for each of them. So it's it's a way that So you can basically specify a minimum latency that you Like, if you would do, like, 1st percentile or COF percentile if you like. Yeah. maximum if you do the hun a 100th 1 or anything in between if you But, like, a perfect experience is a 100% of the time on below some latency. Right? Like, Sorry. I didn't understand. So, I mean, if if So, like, I actually kind of I think it's quite novel and interesting this concept of like, how much of the time like, where am I between minimally minimal quality and, like, perfect. But it's unintuitive me to define perfect as a Is it, like, a percentile been. like, it's either perfect or it's not. Right? It it and, like, what does it mean to have, like, an 85% chance of being perfect Yeah. I'm not freezing as well."

I I understand that that measurements have percentals. But in terms of your Like, my intuition of this having thought about it for 5 minutes is that you should have a single line with 0 to 100. And to the extent that that CDF curve is below 100, it is perfect. Right? And an extent that is between0100 is somewhere between perfect and adequate, and the extent that is past 0, like, the thing is bad. And I mean -- Okay. I I think I've I've made my point. Doing doing that will work within the space. because you can have you you can have a list of 1. Okay. Right? If you want. the the reason we've done this this way is because now you can basically You can define an arbitrary, CDF, for perfection and then an arbitrary CDF for useless Okay. Yeah. So, like, what I'm seeing is definitely a special case of this. So, I guess, the framework is fine. I I still don't grasp case what you're describing, but but I'll get there. Thanks. Thanks. Just following up on that But I also I'm sure I am following correctly. So my impression is that there's essentially infinite number of these 0 to 100. Like, you know, for every possible percentile in here, I could have a different set of 0 to 100. Is that correct? Yep. And so I guess, potentially, the question coming out of this because Martin was saying, you know, you could just have them all be the same all the way up and down the graph that the 01100 are the same. Yep. In this case, this example, what determines y@thep50case it's over here and at the, you know, p 99.9 case it is much more tolerant of slowness, slowness, slowness,"

And so you might have might have a video application that will smooth over if it drops like, one frame or something. So it's fine if every now and then you'd lose one packet, But if you lose many in a row or if you lose them too often, then it stops working. that kind of thing, which in which case, you care about the some lower percentile for your, basically, like, the the how which is basically your base round trip. Right? the lower percent also of the of the latency -- Yep. -- at And then and then you can specify, like, how much packet loss or or basically, have any late packets do I tolerate within my like, whatever the application is done.

I think it may be clearer correct me if you disagree, but, like, And, you know, to have to just draw like like, draw the ideal CDF of, like, I am perfectly like, I'm perfectly tolerant of this CDF because, like, you know, understanding that the p 99 won't be as good as the p 0 because, you know, caching or whatever.

Thank you. Rio Goldberg, they were at QoS, My question is mostly about the sampling rates that you're considering this data at. I have a strong predilection for 10 milliseconds or less. and yours is.

For the rate for the benefit of the rate measurement, It's beneficial for the protocol be able so that reflected packets can vary in the length and even in the number. So, for example, a sequence of reflected packets will be triggered by the single packet send received by the session reflected. So that's how we came up with a proposed t extension TOV. So we can define the session center can define The length of reflected packet the number of reflected packet in the sequence an interval between these packets in that single sequence. So then realize that that gives us interesting property. Because what happens if the number of reflected packets is 0?

And because they go of to their sender. So the sender now might be overrun, by reflected packets. So being able to control Reflector in their reflection of the test packet is beneficial. but that might need some additional instrumentation to do selective reflection. so that only subset of active tails and the multicast distribution tree respond with the measurement. as in a two way measurement protocol.

We need to finalize the firm the wording about basically, what happens if there test packet sent by the session sender includes some TOVs. Yes.

So your prefix length will be 128. Right? So then basically, you are doing exact match. But what about if your prefix length is 48 or 64. Okay?

Yeah. can the standard extension used for multicast environment to be used for BIU environment. Actually, great point. So so I'll be making some review of OEM work in the beer and I'm intended to reference this document so that people can look at it and might be the it will be interesting to them. But, yes, short answer to your question is that because beer is one of the multicast environments, that might be useful in a beer environment as well. Okay. Thank you. interesting jobs, interesting jobs, Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Thank you. So, I mean, we definitely seem like some people have read this how many people have read or skinned this document Cool. Alright. So we're about yeah. 4 or 5 people have replicated that. That's good. As Martin was alluding to maybe things we want to dig in before adoption. But I guess, you know, let's just do another 4, on-site home thing of, you know, are you interested in adopting this work? We'll do a formal adoption"

But during the discussion about last call, and, yes, GTV, which was sometimes raised the point. it is not clear that part about the manageability of the methodology, So we try to propose a framework for the deployment in particular, you see that the overall architecture include the marking node, the transit node, the unmarking node, or the encapsulation node. and the network margin systems because to deploy alternate marketing, you need the network management system. And we try to explain the configuration aspects and also the porting out. So the draft aims to clarify the following aspect. So the deployment domain butter fc's, the proposed standard, clarify that the alternate marketing must be deployed in a controller domain. So we of course, continue to with this requirement of limited domain, We define the rule of each node the measurement nodes, the type of measurements according to one flag, two flags or other multipoint measurements, And then we give also operational guidelines, the kind of information that is needed. the measurement frequency few consideration about the computational load, And the important aspect about configuration.

We hope to have a feedback in particular to understand whether this work is clear and clarify the deployment task effect of the methodology. So I think Let's all commence a welcome, and inputs are. Alright. Any questions, comments? Okay? Do you want yes. -- more? the hop by hop. No. Next slide. Yeah. This is about the stump stump extension for hop by hop a month's measurement. So you know that stamp enables dimension, and of one way around 3 platform months between a sender and a reflector. So but the performance of intermediate nodes is not available. So these draft things to fill this gap and to allowed to measure performance of layout. So if you want to do whole bio measurement now to stamp, you know, you have to start a stump dump test session between for every intermediate node. This is a little bit complex, So this document aims to introduce a new optional TRDs enable this performance of by up for each intermediate node. that, of course, is available to deploy this TLV. several of TRVs that we proposed So"

So and the Also, the IOI am tracing data TLB. So these are proposals. So, yeah, we believe that is something that can can be useful to fill this gap also for stem. to allow whole bioactive measurements. So of of course, this is just the initial proposal and your comments are very welcome to improve this document. and to add further can be so further consideration about the application. total. That's okay. to say 5 minutes. Right? Alright. We we have a question from Greg. or comment. we'll find out. Greg Musky. Excellent.

I prefer direct expert REM because it does not impact on the data pack and the bandwidth that is allocated for the service. but some might have different view. But, again, there are probably easier will be, and it seems that logical that called by half information being connected for on underlay. And then, again, yes, there is always questions how to return this information back to the sender, there will be a discussion I I'm looking forward at 6 men because there there is a proposal for extension to ICMP the 6. But I believe that, again, that probably not really needed is listen information can be distributed over the management plane. And if somebody wants to return it, to the sender, stem sender, then, again, that's all doable. Okay? It's basically the flexibility of the local policy. But, again, idea is interesting and the thing that always you know, complementing getting more information from the network is always helpful But different level. Yeah.

So All the TLV are independent, so we can just commit to the ARM part. Thank you. what what Rafish, Rakesh Gandhi from Cisco Systems. trying to understand how this would work. So the way stamp works is that You know, IP header? And then you have UDP and then the stamp payload, And when a node sees all the IP header, I'm the destination, I look at the UDP, And then I 1 third. process the packet. That's how I do stamp processing. Now this packet is going through hub by hop. No. how does a midpoint know that this is a stamp packet. It has a hop by hop thing I need to process. This is some this is something that need to be So it's just a proposal. So we can further discuss how to so so I mean, if the intermediate nodes is is configured to handle this TLV is configured to handle this time TLV option. let's say, he automatically can be configured to put the information to record the information in the packet together with some identification"

Otherwise, if they don't support, we can make always always always hoped by your measurement. without this specific load. So It depends if the intermediate nodes will support or not Yeah.
