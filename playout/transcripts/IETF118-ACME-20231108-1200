So why do would we even want to do this, I said something I a question I keep having to answer, so I'll answer it again in case anyone to save anyone asking the question again. Because it's just consistency with how every other TLD operates in WAV PKI. Reduces the chance of misissuance in certain circumstances although the chance of misissuance an onion domain is still significantly lower without CAA than for a normal DNS domain, it allows organizational policy to be enforced and it also allows an IO death and points or contact details to be published which certain larger organizations they appreciate on their onion demand. So the first vision just added an extra field in the tour hidden service descriptor containing a tax tool and coding also the CAA records. This presented some challenges. Most of these problems were raised by Latincrept but I understand other CAs had similar concerns, but weren't quite as vocal about them. That, CA needs to run at all clients, then they need security audits for the tall client, the tall client, may not be memory safe, It may not be something think that their pipeline is set up to deploy. It's just it's just more stuff to go wrong that they need to deal with and more stuff to think about So this Yeah.

Flag in the Acme directory, in case the CA CA doesn't support fetching a hidden service scriptor and requires that CAX sent in bond. So there are two places that CAA could be putts, and the challenge response or in the finalized call, in the challenge response, has the advances that it constraints all protocol loss modifications for onions to one API method. But then it would require modifying the response for every possible challenge that could be used and also means that a certificate must be issued within 8 hours or less. Olts, a challenge being responded to. Due to the CA browser forum requirements on CIA. And to finalize call, it will allow issue at any time. It will allow using any validation method without modifying the wants to that validation method challenge This is the option that I went with, because it just seemed like the the the nicer option.

This was just my first instinct for this is how you I'm I'm pretty certain this Security wise is correct, but it might be a more elegant way to do it. The reason for the expiry date in here is, that in the case of HTTP HTTP01 or TLSL piano 1 then the active client may not be the tall head and service. So the Tall Hidden servers might want to pre sign a set of CAA's valid the next month for so, and hand them over to the admin clients and say, when you need any certificates, you can use this as the CAA. But some someone did point out on the mailing list that actually, that's kind of kind of pointless because you'd have to make a connection to the tool network anyway if you were validating HTTP01, etcetera. So you could just fetch the CAA from the hidden services scripter So may maybe this just needs to be signed with a server provided lumps instead of an expiry that might be better in this case.

And I'm picking out digital ocean here for no particular reason, except that they have a really nice screen shotable example of the problem we're trying to solve. So you wanna host your website on digital ocean, it needs a certificate, they can get one for you. Automatically, you don't have to worry about it. There's some acne in the background. It says, let's use Let's encrypt as the title of the tab That is not a drop down, that is not a multi select, that is not anything that I want to be, it's the title of a tab. Don't like Let's encrypt. Great. You can upload a PEM file. Do. Next slide, please. So I know there's this general trend to move towards 90 day validity web PKIcerts, we can't do that while upload a PEM file is the only alternative to let's encrypt. People who have to manually upload PEM files 4 to 6 times a year will not appreciate this development. So we need to solve this this auto automatability problem and fallback CAS and default CAS and preferred CA's problem in these cloud environments we can consider the the move to shorter 90 day or some people who talk crazy talk 14 day certs, yeah, this is blocking. So when subscribers can't specify their preferred acne server, the default becomes the norm. When the default is the norm, we lock issue or diversity with risk becoming a single point of failure the entire ecosystem. Also, Shane was plugged here. The side benefit of this draft, we're proposing allows you to prioritize your list of fallback or preferred acne server. So if you primary server fails to get a cert for some reason or that cert suddenly gets expired or something, you can order the list of CAS that you want your cloud provider to get certs for you for. So how do we do this? How do we automate discovery of the domain owner and the terminology here, I'm using domain owner as in the person who owns the domain who registers the domain and pays the annual fees to own that domain."

In the normal, like, the intention of CAAs to communicate to the CA whether it is allowed to issue this cert or not. We are double using it to communicate to the Acme client, like the Acme bot, the cert bot, we're using CA to communicate to the acme bot. Which CA it should be contacting in the first place. So we it is a bit of a semantics abuse, but we think it's all okay. Next slide, please. So here's the sort of picture I have in my head where I'm thinking about this So Joe admin owns the domain. Joe admin is gonna figurejoe's domain.com in his cloud service provider UI. I'm assuming that Joe admin also has control of his DNS. I'm aware that assumption is not always true. Often, especially for the CA record, cloud ink will take control of that. So that's that's maybe a, maybe a, maybe a, problem with this diagram, but I'm assuming at least that Joe has some sort of control over his own DNS record, whether it's through the cloud NQI or not. He can put whatever he wants in CAA. Acme bought by default or so sorry. The important property of Acrobat is that it is part of the cloud, Inc. Infrastructure. Joe has no direct way to configure AcmeBot. And by default, Akenbot is gonna go to its favorite preferred default CA. What we want is to bootstrap so the AcmeBot will look up the DNS record of the domain. It's trying to get a cert for figure out from there which CA it's supposed to be going to and then go get a cert there. Seems like this should work. This seems sort of straightforward ish enough on on the surface. It does not require any UI changes on cloudinc It does not require any drop downs. It does not require clouding to maintain a list of all known me servers everywhere. It's all sort of the act, you just update the code for AcmeBot in this theory should just go. Okay."

I think 1 or 2 new versions are up since So San Francisco, would you incorporate some of the feedback on the mailing list? I'm gonna skip over that and we can maybe do can be next to IETF agreed to go back and do a full look at the diff, but the problem that we ran into is external or internal account binding mechanisms. So the general problem here is if you assume, like, a commercial CA where we have to have a billing billing account to CUDA charge or they've done EV validation or this this account can issue both SMIME and TLS or can issue mean, anything you anything you can imagine where there's multiple cert profiles or these humans can issue this type not that type, but it's all the same domain. Of this gets complicated. We need to know sort of calling it the account disambiguation problem, which here's an acme request which billing account, which CA account is that supposed to go against for authorization purposes turns out to be trickier than we expected. So subproblem 1, is that we can't use the ACME account for that disambiguation. The ACME account will, in general, be owned by the cloud service provider. And the cloud service provider may either use a single Acme account key across all of their tenants, Like, they may have a single pipe to the to the ACVY server. Case, that's not helpful for disinviguation. Or they may just spin up fresh acme accounts at will and some the fresh acne account per request, in which case, also, we can't use that for disambiguation. The second sub problem here is within one CA. Billing account. So, like, one credit card could have multiple subgroups of admin are not allowed to talk to each other or not allowed to issue each other's cert profiles. So we also can't use domain"

Because in general, it has more she has stronger permissions broader permissions than where I really want to delegate to my cloud service provider. My Acme account might have might be able to issue all sorts of fun and magical stuff, and I wanna let cloud make issues, some very small subset of it. So maybe this could be workable. Also, you need a way to pass that through the cloud, the to cloud service provider UI down to the ACME client, which is which is now us begging cloud providers to make UI changes that we don't wanna get into. So we consider this. It may work in some cases, but we think it's not a general solution. Next slide. So more a little more detail here on the Kami accounts are not unique for the CA. So this is that picture that the AcmeBot is owned by Cloudinc, but Cloudinc may is gonna serve multiple cuss and it may have one single pipe. So, yeah, we can't can't use that. Problem, next problem, problem 1, from 2, Problem 2 is actually the one that really got us stuck. So here, we've sort of got this case where there's, you know, widgets inc has department a that is web server admins, and that's Joe and Susan, and and they also have department B, which is email server admins, and that's Sophie and Fred, and Joe and Susan should be able to request TLS certs, but Sophie and Fred shouldn't, but they're all for star. Widgets.com. And this unfortunately requires me to draw a picture of the CA's database model, how the CA structures its customer models somehow becomes relevant here, which is becoming really quite a mess.

Internal account binding using email, maybe is workable, but the security properties are a bit not great. Internal account binding using a domain validation, a DV type, authorization might be workable. We've sort of started sketching out a solution there, but we're not really ready to present it. Slide, please So this is all a bit design ongoing. Yeah. We do present why we're stuck. We don't really ready to present solutions. We definitely need more vendors to get involved help us make sure we're designing if we even have the all the problems sort of understood properly. For example, a 4th option that could could have gone on this slide is you put a just an account disambiguation UUID and your CCA record, and maybe that's enough to figure out which subset, sub, sub, sub account. This is supposed to go to for authorization.

Fair, though, Yeah. It's Yeah. The one could argue both ways.

And so I'm I'm I would like you to remind me exactly why a lot of these problems, can't be fixed relatively easy just by making making the, current widely used idea of putting parameters in CAA for accounts and just extending that to be a little bit smarter so that you have additional information so that it's not just per domain, but it could also be per profile so that, you know, you could have account equals x and, you know, because we're already gonna have to do stuff.

So, yeah, I think you're referring the CAA comment. You're referring to the Acme account URI, which is already a something notionally similar to that. Right? Yeah. Or or even actually that. Yes. Yeah. No. I I I'm really here to say we found a problem and then got busy with other things and haven't propose good solutions to it, but, like, this yes. Plea, yes, please. Yeah. No. If you're forming an informal design team, sign us up. Hi, Greg Jewell's ISC. Are just thinking about potential ways in which you could do this. I mean, if you were wanting to use the CAA record, it's possible for a domain to have multiple of them. I think just following a very similar theme that, you know, you can convey a lot more information in a CAA request just one thing. Or there's another group active here this week which is the the main control validations they're trying to standard. How you validate the domain is actually yours, and that like a very extensible mechanism that they proposed Oh, yeah. I mean, this is gonna need to go beyond domain validation. If you consider"

There aren't your sorts of information that you could contact that you could convey in in an adns request and and get back in that response that might allow you to do what you need to do. Yeah. I think question we're stuck on is what information needs to be conveyed we need the CAs to weigh in and say, my account because my account my my database account look like this. I need 3 layers of sub key. Like, we just need sort of what information needs to be an DNS record so we can uniquely identify an account. Okay. Is sort of what we're at. Yeah. How to convey it? Probably CAA Act me account with URI or something is the right way to do but also please, I mean, please mailing list, with suggestions. So if the queue is empty, And the queue is empty. Then, yeah, question to chairs, what do you wanna do with this work of ours, yeah, as pointed out, it's not adopted yet. So I think you need a little more work to do before we ask for working group if you wanna go to the list and see if you can get CAs together to talk about what the best options are. I do agree that it's gonna be easier to work with the ethnic client than it to work with the cloud providers, who are probably not interested in talking to you. If we can't even find them all. Well, you can't find them all. That's the problem. Richard's not in the cubase. Got news video on. Yeah. I just wanna leap in there and emphasize a point that that QMADE, which is that this is not purely a technical issue either, even if you fix the acne clients, It's not clear that the CSPs are gonna be willing to like, go out and talk to random acne providers, just because the DNS told them to. I think there there's some slightly deeper issues here. As well. I think there's lots of security issues. I mean, you talk about putting things in DNI like that, and"

Whether you do it on your own or whether you do that conjunction with other CAs. I'm fine with that. How far do we have to get before hacking working group sort of says, yes, we should spend time on this as a working group. Just some sort of, at least, reasonable path forward that you're happy with. Or halfway happy with? Like, you're not happy with it at all at this point. Right? I mean, Maconate most of it, I think, is the account biting part. Yeah. You need to be a little happier with it. Sorry. It's not very, like, concrete. At least a little a little a little closer to what you think a reasonable path forward is. Yeah. And especially if, like, Richard's gonna challenge using DNS in the first place, then that's a yeah, he he already has. So, You don't see the chat. Yeah. So I think that's sort of where we are. I think a little more work to be done is is okay. Is that fair? I don't and I don't really wanna take a about a raising hands or whatever we call that here. That sound good to go off? Yeah. I think so. We could have, poll if some people think it's, ready I think most people think it's not ready for adoption. Could be next time. Drafted get adopted to get worked on and change a lot when they're while they're in the working group process. That's It's just that we're not really sure what we're, what would be voting on. Is this like, are we doing a DNS, or are we doing OAuth? It's kind of all over the place. So wouldn't have"

That maybe we can work on that and then change everything inside it I think we'd rather be sure it was a good idea, right, before we start adopting it as a working item. Like, I'm fine with having things change, but let's make sure it's really a solid idea before we do that. We don't wanna work and provide him that we later abandon it was never a good idea anyway. Fair? Okay. Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. So one more slide. Into a control. Oh, I do. What? What's the data? Look it up. Okay. Any other business? Do Stand up. it. I know we do have any other business, so Bob back, Google. Just wanted to call attention if anybody was at, TLS. We have a draft we're working on for TLS trust extensions, which is somewhat sizable. It includes we are using the lovely part of ACME that allow you to specify alternate chains with multiple links and the response. And that's a partial solution for what we're looking at, and we recognize that there's probably future work to go on and act me there. Just wanted to say hello And if anybody's interested in things that might return certificate chains and acne. We'd love to talk to you and love to have you play along in future. Thank you. you.
