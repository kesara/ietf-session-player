    "text": "Ben stone each and one of the co-authors on the draft for native deployment of ICN in 4G LTE mobile networks so as an introduction trying to gain some time here as an introduction the draft was about holistic view of native IC and deployment specific to the 4G network some of its aspects would apply to patch in the future hopefully but this is dealing really with the different scenarios of what happens if ICN is enabled or is not enabled in certain particular parts of the network so we are looking at the options here what if what if UE is a dual capable so if you have to deckhand has the choice to make and none of the other nodes in the network are ICN enabled on another hand what if I see an enable through that and the Yui is only IP capable so the idea of the draft is to go through different scenarios and explain what it was doing what was what what needed to be changed with some specific proposals of the introduction of the transport kamuran Slayer that would deal with this so as summary of draft updates we want to tend to chairs and all the reviewers we received quite a few comments and we implemented these reviews in the latest change major changes I will show on the next slide there\u0027s a three of them I believe and as far as minor changes in addition to Dirk who was present from before we rally was listed as a co-author on the draft and then also we have a pair of Fry\u0027s some of the text and updated new references after some comments like that for example the QoS section has been clarified we have defined we have identified that certain parity needed to be present between the IP and ICN now will it be changing principle or will it be or or not this beyond the point the thing is that the the features such as prioritization such as policing or shaping in some shape or form would need to be present also there was some minor changes in the security section Security section has not really has listed the security concerns now we have that done however a certain more research would need to be done and I also seen in one of the previous presentations that were marks I believe would be dealing in details about security as far as the major changes to the document so we have added a reference there was a comment that there is no distinction between live content like broadcast services and and on the main content so we have added reference to the broadcast and multicast technologies e/m BMS specifically so that we would handle the multicast deliver in a pre-planned haunt and so with a light content versus that one "

    "text": "that would be on demand in this example also there were many references in the document prior to this revision - and the end they were specific to end the end and we were kind of going between and the NCCN so now we have moved from end the end to see CNX based ICM protocol and messages which is in line with IC energy drats now this expect to be normalized once the whole harmonization effort has been completed but this is on our side we\u0027re not dealing more on the CC NX as opposed to mixing and also the change was that after one comment we he removed the transport convergence layer which as a reminder just is responsible for dealing with specifics of choosing the right protocol depending on the author of its presence in the next hop or in the transport so for example if the if the UE is dual capable the transport is not you it would need this player would make a decision which protocol to use and would pick the right protocol based on the presence on the next one so this has been removed from the protocol step in a PG 8 way and the reason for that is in this case with dual stack ICN deployment in Yui we used to have transport conversions there so the right thing would be to have transport convergence layer between Yui and on the CDN side in this specific case beta gateway is IC and aware but we need to make a strict distinction between capability to do ICN transport and big IC and where you guys you know we\u0027re means that the US should be able to attach via ICN even if ICN transport is not present as such meaning that may not be capable of transport but needs to be aware of the application level so that you can be ICN attached and then it can be sent over to the CBN side - we\u0027re all so the transport convergence layer would be present and the transport selector would deploy the right conversion or right choice dress election as far as the next step next steps we are currently implementing this in the lab so we are the future draft versions will have updates based on the results from the lab trials which we are in the process of setting up yes Cisco Cisco Systems we will be using CC annex in the code and that is being in the process of being set up so the future revisions should have some results from from the trials from empiric results and also we need to now this is not necessarily the next section or area for future graph updates could also be new experimental read so not that this won\u0027t all necessarily be in this draft but are certainly some questions that need to be answered in the future such as investing you have to meet the IP QoS requirements just like I mentioned it has to be met some way in ICN then also in investigate "
