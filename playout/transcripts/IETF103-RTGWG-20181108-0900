    "text": "community around all these different projects that are tied together in creating something that is useful as a whole so I want to sort of maybe clarify something both for myself for and for others or get you to clarify the first part of your presentation talked about using open-source as sort of to do Network management\u0027s as a network operator this is more how you used open source in FRR the internals of a router basically okay so just there\u0027s a distinction there that you know probably the right so in the beginning I said I will give you overview of the open-source tools that you can use in building a system and then that\u0027s used FRR as an example how to use them because I could have just left it here\u0027s the overview of them fine but this gives you an additional way how they were used in an open-source implementation and you can go in there and take a look by yourself how it was exactly implemented right right but I just want to make the distinction that like many users of these open-source tools wouldn\u0027t be say building their own FRR or you know extending that they would be using them too as to connect to monitor a network and configure a network yes correct okay so so we were for instance in the process of packaging up the plug-ins that you use with history but to implement the ITF interfaces an ITF IP and ITF systems model so we use those standardized models it talks to the kernel it talks to the open wrt configuration subsystem and then you can configure this open wrt box you can also take this repo in the same plugin and for the stuff that it talks to the kernel net link interface you can run this on a server as well and you can change the IP address of the server interface or whatever so there you didn\u0027t mention much about the plugins that you also need here but this is what implements the model you load the model you load the plug-in and now you can use the model that then runs the code in the plug-in that actually does something there there are guidelines how to develop your own plugins and yes on the previous slide if you can just go back please on the previous slide I forgot to mention that each one of this daemons has its own plugin that is being used to connect to a different centralized management daemon and if you want to use a another one you can develop that plugin buyer by yourself and just use it there well we are on topic if you\u0027re interested in specific computer Scheffer are there\u0027s young sub channel on a four-hour slug you could totally Turing out who\u0027s doing this work if you\u0027re interested please enjoy okay "
