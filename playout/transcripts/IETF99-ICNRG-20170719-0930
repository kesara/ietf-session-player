    "text": "okay so this is like more the kind of can say a complimentary draft to the design consideration staff because when you do IOT implementations you have to invariably depend on certain tool kits like middleware functions - on both the devices and then basically authenticate it to the network and network authenticates that device to your device discovery service discovery content distribution and so on so forth so this is fundamentally kind of kind of spending lot of the time in to basically give people a motivation on solutions that can be around to serve those kind of functions and and basically we also provide a lot of discussion around how NDMC CC and our mobility first there are this two protocols we consider in specific discussions related to that so again we have collaborators here I mean focus folks who are in IOT space and we have P folks who are doing kind of more something that I know LC name resolution system and we have people who work from the indian space - so both those opinions and kind of solutions are being pursued are being reflected in this job so so the main change from I mean we lot of changes are specifically spread around the draft but we kind of in the section 4.1 we kind of separate we had only initially device discovery but we added one section on device onboarding and discovery because they\u0027re fundamentally two different things so when you do something like onboarding of devices it\u0027s it\u0027s - basically you want to it\u0027s it\u0027s movie about authenticating the device that is coming into the network and the network called the device authentication to the network and network also authenticates to the device so that\u0027s the onboarding one and the discovery is when you are actually announcing to the network somewhere that ok this device is there and so you can route to this device you can pull content from this device so that\u0027s where my question for Schenk was in most of the this argument discussions we have in the device onboarding you actually give a name to the device right so you actually say this is this is a thermostat or basically if those names could also be actually coming from the actual agree later point itself so but this the sizes I mean if you want to get data from that it\u0027s actually operating on different namespaces and you also have some touch mechanisms actually routed on that namespace so so that\u0027s where my question was earlier so anyway so this is the mostly the outline of the draft there\u0027s a lot of material in this draft I mean it\u0027s good for code some people could comment and and basically tell us you know how we could improve it but I\u0027ll just go through the updates of this draft so we we presented this in 96 ITF and then we have we didn\u0027t we haven\u0027t received any feedback yet but we did a revision of it considering I see an IOT there\u0027s a lot of work going on the last "
