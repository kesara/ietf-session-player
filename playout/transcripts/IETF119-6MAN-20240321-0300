Please keep this in mind when you saying I'm doing anything in this room? This is not well, which I hope you've seen before. Please read it if you have not read it this week yet? And slides indeed are available on data care. So if the font is not big enough for you, you can download them there. Medium tips. Yes. Please, please, please use me to a call on-site client if you'd like to join the queue. Otherwise, the chairs have no idea. You should be And it also makes the meeting take care life much, much easier. So they know who is speaking. You can either open agenda site or if you can use you can use QR codes scanner to scan this Lovely thing on the left screen. And it will get you to zone site 2 and for this meeting. If you're using on-site if you joining me, take off from your device while in the room, please. Keep the audio and video off. Actually, that's applied to remote participant as well. And, yeah, minimal we we have only have one remote presenter about, yeah, people who will will be a a comment in, please, yeah, keep your audio video or fine till you're actually actively speaking.

We're gonna spend about like 15 minutes talking about all these interesting documents we are producing. So and David, you comment on this? David Skinazi, ipv6 enthusiast. I have a potential agenda bash, but feel free to tell me no because it's kinda selfish. On the second part, 2nd part? Yes. We actually probably 2 out of 3. The next slide? Yeah. Yes, sir. Is so I have a conflict for the 2nd hour, but feel free to tell me that I'm special. Is there any chance could flip the first two there? you That that would make my life easier. I really want to attend Brian's talk, but No worries if you can't. We might actually need to do this because Iran is not online yet. Actually intentionally put wrong at the first presenter be, because of time zones. Because Kathleen remotely, but if he does not appear online, we'll Thank you. We'll go straight to a presentation. Yes. So, yeah, back to our agenda, we're gonna talk about 2 working group drafts we have. And then we have a number of individual drafts Some of them are actually at least one of them actually currently in the adoption call. So it's in and state, And We have a number of presentations signed if time allows category. So, yeah, we cannot guarantee anything But, we'll see document status. By the way, yeah.

You I Eric, you had a little comment on this Because, yeah, it looks like we're going to have another draft, which is on today's agenda, and there is another draft in HTTP bees, just also related. Yes, Eric Klein. So the first draft here is basically through telechat, we have one final discuss to resolve. We have ideas for some text. That discusses rolled off with the change in constitution of the ISG, but it would still be great to actually close with the discussholder to the extent possible. So I don't think that should take too much longer before we can get it to the RFC editor. Next two are in, AD AD eval that's on me, and 6874bis as yeah. So I was gonna basically wait till this today's discussion to understand. So I can so people will understand why we're marking it dead, or I can return it to the working group and you can market it. You can let it, let it decline. But it it is, I mean, it is effectively dead. For reasons that will become clear later, or we could have the discussion now. I'm I'm okay with agenda bashing, Murray said he could be here if we move it later, but he's got some other thing to do he's where he's in his own working group right now. So it might, it might not even be able to be here. So it's probably better if you're here, anyway. So ver burden hand and all that. So anyway, yes.

Decision needs to be made what to do about those scoliosis before we can advance the draft. So I, like, I do not think there are any problems with advancing the draft. We just need to agree or the group needs to agree what, what the draft should say about this. So, yeah, sorry. I was way too optimistic while making the slides. So for extension header draft, Are we would like to solicit an additional round Like, when you 1st of all, yeah, we'd like to ask for a volunteer for shaper against this document. How many people actually have read this extension header limit document. Also, we should have a lot of Okay. Who cares about the extension limit? Essential header. So anyone would like to be a shepherd Yeah. Both, please. Yeah. So if you're interested in being a shepherd for this, please contact us like to talk to you. and we'd Yep. And, We actually would like probably to ask 1 or 2 additional reviewers for this again. Because some concern been raised, and we actually would like to have a, like, few more people to review it.

Right? Which basically means adoption call or explicit confirmation from the chair. Right?

So is there an intent for 6 man to pick up work around the handling of, UDP based ipv6 packets. As a result of the information presented there. I guess you're referring to fragmentation issue. Or what the Any UDP based, messaging where the MTUs may not mismatch. Am I hearing you are volunteering to write a draft? I believe, RFC 10:35 has already been written, and IPV 6 may be incompatible with that. So And so and so my question is are the chairs intending to liaise with the other working groups on this? Or do you want a draft coming out of that working group to address the topic of, the incompatibility between the transport and the protocol. The chest. Yeah. I, yeah, I I will here. No. We we Lorenzo. Sorry to clarify. I ran Lorenzo. My question was That's a great question. Right? Like, we have to me, it seems like we just have this bug. We've had this bug in back since 1998. I think fragmentation just doesn't work. We should, like, put it out of its misery, but the quest but the question there's not right. You know, what, like, the question was, like, you know, question was like, are the chairs gonna get involved? And I'm like, why would this why would the chairs be? Why would it be on the chairs to get involved? You know, maybe this working group should pursue a solution I'm I'm just gonna point to the text there that says confirmation"

We'll follow-up and respond or bring it to the working group list. You know, you know, Jared, I think this is This is basically a statement of when to be involved. 6 man might or might not be involved in any random working group other business? And if if I can also clarify what this means, We get drafts. To individual drafts for work in other work groups, and we don't We found it not very useful to give them agenda time here until we've heard from the working group that this is active work that that working group it in. That's what this is talking about. I think this the issue with DNS transport is slightly different different different different different I think D and S transport or or UDP as a transport. Grpgrpc Whatever you use. or Google portal buffs over UDP, would also be an issue if you have a device that goes and emits them because all of the egress interfaces are of that. So do you want a document saying that UDP is problematic in ipv6. Sure. Or or So, yeah, I I, yeah, I Yes. Yes. Is that like if individuals or another working group see a problem which Might be in school for 6 men. We're happy to we're happy to bring this to the working group. Right?

So, this working group published a spec That breaks existing protocols and transports on the internet. Mix it. Yeah. Praple propose some, you know question for the chat. Yes. It is.

If it's a draft for 6 men, which should be in 6 men, Then, obviously, yeah, we'll consider it. It's tallest record. Yeah. So I I think we can talk about it also in my slot, right? So my individual slot here is to try to get progress on the things I very much feel is within the realm of 6 men to to do about the extension header, for example, as opposed to do in the realm of the working group. Right? So and I don't think that needs to be totally serialized, right, because by the point in time or working group may have come to conclusion. Then it goes into 6,000,000, 6,000,000 Yeah. Sorry. That doesn't work. Right? So I, I, I think to some degree, we need to figure out what's Mhmm. That that's that's one way. Right?

My motivation said, Oh, let's serialize everything, and I'm trying to now we we need to start paralyzing it. Otherwise, we're making decision that 6 men is way too late than rejecting, for example. Right? So we need to avoid that as well. So the the reason why this exists because sometimes work is coming to 6 men inform of agenda slot request. And we do not think 6 months is necessary, has the expertise to understand if there's a problem we're solving and so on. So we want want this to be done first in some other place. That's Yeah. Suresh, Krishna, so I think this, like, slide is like a little bit more vague than the intent of that thing. I think that might be what's tripping Jared, probably, is that this is for the extension space that we own. Right? 6 man is like extension headers or options and everything. 6 man is not gonna look at them until the other group has shown some interest in, like, doing that thing. Right?

If there's an issue to be fixed, Like, I'll sit with you. We'll do it. Yeah. What's no. I am sorry we made this impression. It wasn't intention. Oh, yeah. We'll follow-up on this.

So none under a network con construct to support the natural slides or enhanced VPN services services. Previously, this traveler used a ATM as the term to refer to the virtual handling network according to the consensus in the team's working group, it was agreed to converge to the term NRP.

So this information can be used to, the transit nodes to determine the, an RP packet belongs to, and the per NRP packet processing and the forwarding can be performed. Before this meeting, there was, some discussion on the main list about the one flag, defining this option called s flag, And, we had added some additional, text and also it has a discussion about the usage and benefit of this flag in on the Middle East. So based on the discussion and the feedback, it seems that we can continue to keep this as flagging this document. Okay. Next slide, please. So here are the updates, since last presentation, as I mentioned, the terminology and description are aligned with have naturalized framework and the enhanced VPN framework documents the term and RPC used consistently between knowledge's documents. And so we need to rename the the hop hop option and the related ID and the option an as an RPID on an RP option, respectively. Also elaborate the usage of this flag and span its benefits. Basically, the S flag allows, find granular control of the packet forwarding behavior for package in an an RP, especially when the an IP ID and the packet cannot match with the locally provision and RPs. We also have some editorial changes to improve the readability. Okay? Okay. Best of luck. Oh, here, we just, want to show the discussion about the S flag on the mailing list. We've got some feedback from Matt, and since we run set match for the, about discussion is, from his opinion, beginning, the usage of that flag is not clear.

Awesome specific service flows, of an NRP. And this NRP is not provisioned on the transit node. In this case. If we use, configurate local configuration, it'll be burdensome as it has to be to be done on all the nodes along the trans falling parts. It will also require additional configuration models for therapies, because that kind of configuration is required for the RP which was not provisioned on the nose. And, similar comments from customers who receive that, also think that maybe a global, configuration knob can be used to to control weather drop off, do the fallback. And we had a reply to Cadence with kind of, information like a global number may not be enough for this case because we need a at least for an RP control or maybe even more fine granular control for a subset of packaging than RP. And it is for another piece which was not, provision on the node, the con configuration will be and you wrote in the current configurations. Next slide, please. So the next step of this document, we believe we have a reserve address all the comments received, and the content has been stable. We have aligned the terminology with other documents So we sync this document now is, ready for working with last call.

So in the hardware. Along all routers along the path. Therefore, I think this option should be as simple and as efficient as possible for hardware processing. This was the background of my comment on the s flag. Now if you look at the hop option, the way it is defined today, has a reserve field. It has these flags with this s flag, which is really more to solve inconsistency between configuration. Right? And it has a variable length and RPID, which cut cut cut cut role, context p. I think we really have to reevaluate and Consider why not just make it a simple hub by our provider, which is a fixed size and carries only the NRP ID Nothing else. You are proposing to remove all the other fields in the option. Yes. Keep make it as simple as possible for for it to be successful, Make it as simple as possible and just have the NRP ID And, of course, I mean, we can discuss this in the teas working group right where, where this is done because there is similar NRP in NPL label stack, work, and it could be coordinated. But, I just wanted to know, views on that. Yeah. Yeah. I think med I think that was also perhaps what med maybe want to clarify your point. Yeah.

It will require you to, have, 100 NAPIs configuration to, specify the forwarding behavior when the package is arrived that NRP ID is not matched So this kind of a configuration model is considered like a x Marie. That's it. Put in some. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry, printer. So I think we should look at it in the context of the this framework, NRP framework work that is in peace. It is required to come provision those resources. If a packet is coming without the resources being provisioned let's say for a slice or, for the NRP itself, then it's not going to get that treatment. I mean, it The whole purpose of the NRP is defeated in my But again, this is not a topic for 6 months, so I don't want to take up time here. But we should discuss in these I feel Yeah. Maybe we can have some discussion, in case about the needed functionality related to an NRP the here, I think we also, consider the comments from the every director about to make it a account, kind of generic for future so that we leave some reserve fields. We also allow extensions for some other functionality, but the for the NRP basic functionality.

And, I'm here to talk about signaling a prefix delegation availability to hosts with, McCothers, next slide, please. Just as a recap, this is a companion document to the V Six ops, which, describes the network side of things, As a recap, what we are trying to do is trying to make sure that we can use pre physical allegation to in general notes, but specifically you're here for hosts to, provide addresses to hosts. And what we are trying to do specifically with this document, the the operational model has basically got through V6 ops. It's now sort of on its way to the ice g. But what I'm trying to do specifically with this document is we're trying to provide a way to tell hosts whether it's a good idea to ask for a prefix or not. The reason is that some networks where you have scalability issues, you know, you can look at the v 6 ops a document for more information. Yes. Scalability issues. And, a prefix is gonna be a lot much less of a load on the network. To form multiple addresses and forming individual addresses. And this is true if this is useful as the network has plenty of space. The network is constrained, it's like a home network only has a slash 60 or slash 56, it's not possible to there's not enough prefix to hand out a big prefix to every device. And so we want a way to signal into the device"

And like I said, this is this is always this is very similar to what we've been talking about for a while. This hasn't progressed very much because we were waiting for the V Six ops document to to get through the working group and get on way to the SG. Next slide, I guess. That that that as a recap, what are we doing? We're adding a new flag the PIO And it says if you understand this flag, do not run Autocomp from this PIO. Do not form addresses here. Instead, start at the HTTP client, if you haven't already started 1, and get a, prefix And you can assign addresses for that prefix. You can it's a delegated brief you can do whatever it is that you can do with the prefix that's delegated to you. You can form addresses out of it. Can announce it to your sort of, like, subtended hosts. You can assign it to VMs, whatever. And it needs to be in the PIO because it's specific the the the the the bit to turn on PD is kind of per network, but the the the the thing that says turn off slack for this PIO is specific to that PIO. You might wanna use you you might wanna still use Slack, for example, for ULA addresses but use PD to obtain a global prefix. For example, And, for multi homing, of course, you might have different upstreams with different opinions. Next slide. So, there have been sort of some amount of discussions some amount of feedback that the host behavior is under specified. In particular, that feedback has gone to the six ops draft where it's kind of out of scope. Like, the V Six ops draft is really about the networking. This is the place to discuss host behavior. And I just put a refresher here. This this none of this is new in in the draft. You know, this draft has been quite stable for a while.

In general, just like, you know, like 8415 says, hpv6 if the client detects a change in configuration information, must issue rebind. Because it's prefix allegation, not addressing were addressing, it would have to use confirm. But for example, if a prefix is that is deprecated, the hosted issue rebind, this This can be helpful. For example, if the host is roaming to a different subnet, And it also clarifies the the slide also clarifies, again, the 6 was already in the draft. But, you know, just just here for as a refresher. If you assign addresses from the prefix, you can use as many addresses as you want And you must do source address selection as though the addresses were assigned to the interface, where you got the prefix. So, for example, if you were to assign this prefix on a downstream interface because you wanted to act as a rudder, for example, for tethering, you want to originate traffic from you need to do, for the purpose of source address selection, you need to treat those addresses if they were on the upstream And also if you address if you assign the the prefix on the downstream interface, if you have all the hosts there, you must defend those dresses from dad, you must, like, respond to neighbors of discovery for those addresses and so on. And also we, added text to make sure, we've had text to make sure that in a multi homing situation, you can still get multiple prefixes by PD and still assign them to the next to the right next stop for a rule 55. And, this actually is a new addition that we put in don't forward packets that come from the interface you got the prefix. The interface. It'll create a loop Don't do it. Don't do it.

We are trying to, again, we are trying to make this a workable address assignment model. That marries the benefits of DGP. Wiz the benefits of being able to form as many addresses as we want using slack. We think this is actually and meaningful step forward in ipv6's capabilities. Definitely much better than what we could ever achieve in IP before. So And the draft, This draft was adopted shortly after ITFO number 8. There have been, like, no comments, only very minor changes to the text. Next slide. From So, yeah, so we we think this is ready for last call. Because, again, it's been pretty stable. And, we also we have an implementation on Android that's in progress. Do have a PD implementation. One of the issues with turning on that PD implementation is that we could potentially break existing networks because we don't have a clear signal about when we turn this off we are we right now, what we have in Android is code that if it gets an RA, And it can't find under us, It assumes that the network doesn't wanna do slack. And it starts PD. This is a heuristic. We don't know how well it'll work in the real world. And the bar is kinda really high. And so we are waiting to in order to really do PD900, we kinda need this I think, to make sure that we can do it safely."

Sure, Ash. Yeah. Thanks, Lorenzo. So, I'm still not convinced that the way to do it. I'd I did go through the reasoning in the draft. So there's couple of issues I have with that. There's no relation shipped between the prefix you're gonna get using PD and what's in the PIO. Right? So the And and the other part that worries me is that there could be multiple PIO. Right? Like, so, you need to talk about inconsistency between So I I personally think there should be an RA flag. Instead of a pair of flag, but you I'm I'm sure you have something. Their respects. No. No. If you have that out, really like to see that and, like, kind of like, evaluate based on that thing, why you didn't pick r a flag. Because for me, the r a flag needs everything, and and this piece is not linked to the maybe Jen has something she looks like very eager to ask. I I just sorry. I'm just jumping into this discussion because I just realized that you might want to wait for my presentation about my individual draft which theoretically might make it possible to be array because arrays will be specific for prefix. Do you know? Because currently, if you have multi homing scenario, you'll send 1 array, right? And you might the one thing to do with your prefix still. So, yeah, actually, we have a the draft about why it is in PIO. Actually, yeah, so please take a look for If it comes to your question. I did. I did just wanna make sure that it's that look at it. I you wanna go, like, kind of talk about what happens if there's multiple peers or different Okay. So so adding adding text, explain what happens. One thing to point out, like, given the the discussion and stack, I think, you know, earlier this week, RA flags are, like, very ill defined. Right? You basically It's not really a good one. You can actually define this because I like the definition of this. It says like not having this set to 0 does not signal. I I would have loved that. In my home. The fact that you can't cancel a flag in the RA because it's always there. That's sort of painful. You can deprecate the PIO, but you can't remove the flag. Anyway, so I guess"

It's really an issue about the scope of the draft.

Secondly, this whole issue called Cross origin security, when you have a locally significant URI that only applies In the machine where it's created, and on the interface that it refers to, and doesn't apply as such in any other machine or on any other interface, And we've had a year's discussion. We've updated the draft 6 times, and we have basically no prospect of a compromised solution, and then that's why the draft is going to be presented in HTTP. This is also relevant. Next please.

It means entering in local addresses and user interfaces. It's it's Very supposedly, Very strictly scoped.

I'd like to the line that they become critical in the ipv6 only era because if you Can't type in an address that you need to type in. You can't go back. To the ipv4 alternative. Simplest use cases, the existence check does this address exists we do normally do that with ping. So ping actually normally already satisfies our requirements. You might need to configure a device.

I don't know. When it comes to today's great draft, right? I would say that, yeah, we should do everything for MDNS to work better multi homing a couple of things to do. Hopefully, we'll get people around. I just don't want it to retire 8847. I think that is a, you know, thing for APIs, as I said, in programming, for network operators, and the argument that shouldn't be implemented because probably 2 router course in the world, don't want to have the complexity to implement it, that's fine, right? I don't think we need to built a standard RFC for the ipv6, address architecture and how to press it based on what browsers can implement, not everything we're standardizing here. Does have to be implemented by browsers, right? So Sorry. 1000 of things. Lawrence Aquiliti a few points. I think I lost my notes. Well done. Okay. So, I think a lot of tools already will do this.

So if you pass the string, If you know well enough, at least to pass the string down to get out of info, will work. And that's why even Java actually support scoped addresses. We know because we got link local addresses wrong three times in Android. It's like, hopefully, now they're here to stay. But, So I think a lot of the stuff will get will just automatically work, I think. The API point is a good one.

So I think is Probably most languages got that right. Another thing around browsers, One thing to point out is that, you know, I think Chrome and Firefox couldn't use another interface even if they wanted to. Like, I know for sure Chrome is not capable of using a different interface. It is, like, a single network code, and it's, like, very, very tightly coupled to that. What Believe me. Yes. So one thing I wanted to say, I did say on the list. Is I think we should say that for for browsers, for for for applications that don't understand this, they should at least accept a link local address And if the OS has some concept of default interface, they should just use it. If they know no better because that will get you your URL in your browser. Right? You can say if you type fe80 colon colon 1, Chrome doesn't know how to do interfaces anyway, but if you type 5080 colon colon 1, and it's running on Windows, which has a default network. It'll just work. I think that is something that we should say here and it is not something I feel that, like, the browser community could have any, particular opinion on because at the end of the day, it's an IP address. We just define the rules communication, and we are a starter for those rules. So I think that's a better way to get the browser to work if you want to. And I think that's what I had to say. Yeah. This is Brian. Just to comment, Thank you for that input about Chrome. It's that matches exactly what I've observe while hacking around at the MDNS solution a bit.

So I liked the fact the draft is not specific to HEP. Right? And in in a sense, it's written that HCP is out of scope. This is talking of just about in general, whether it's about using your eyes or any other type of identifier, right? And so I think that it was a good approach I like the, address. Sorry. The the title and the abstract are nicely worded in the sense of my question is not about those because I think those are fine. My question is about the normative content that you mentioned. Which constraints it to link local addresses, and that operates out of the assumes that your opening it to unicast. I claim that another use case is you ever have to type in something, there's a case we have to type in a multicast address. You type in a multicast address, link local is not the only k? And so I would ask if it's possible, or if you think it's a reasonable use case, that section 3, abstracted to be scoped address rather than link local address. That's my question. Yeah. I think that's actually a very good point. The the only reason I'm a bit hesitant about the scope terminology is that as you know, we scraped the other interesting scope which was site local, so Yes, sir. Only for unicorns, for multicast, you still have a bunch So that's my question. That's why I'm saying it's really a multicast question. If you treat multicast, as being in scoop of the draft. Then you should because I think your recommendations apply equally to multi nothing magic about unicast and the recommendations that you talked about so far, because it's all about these interface players. So I think if you if you if you want to treat multicast as another one of the use cases, because you listed a bunch of interesting If you have, multicast address there, then I think it's just some wording tweak I think all the rest of your recommendations to apply.

And I think from these conversations, we've realized that Browsers are kinda quite different from something like ping. And if you're curious to understand why, please come to my presentation to tomorrow morning in HTTP best. But, anyway, Let's just assume for here for today's conversation that they're separate. In the case of browsers, you, like, the solution isn't that simple, and so Brian's draft to says that and declares them out of scope, which I think is good.

This is definitely this is this is, yesterday's slide So, Stewart did a nice explanation of what a stub router is, which is different than what's on this slide. I'm gonna do Stewart's explanation as best I can. And what's on this slide is also true. Basically, the idea of a snack router is to Make it possible to connect devices to an infrastructure network through a router that connect that itself connects automatically to an infrastructure network. So in other words, essentially, to give, the same experience for devices connected to the stub network as would be"

And you're a homeowner and you're not an expert on networking. And so you're not gonna go in and modify the configuration user interface of your router to make this work. It has to it has to happen automatically. So, so Stub Broader's basically have to do a lot of reasoning or maybe reasoning is the wrong word, but they have a bunch of heuristics that they follow about what they see on the infrastructure your network. And based on those heuristics, they engage in various behaviors. So, so this document is about a thing that we need to do in order to to enable those heuristics to work properly. Next slide. So Stubbornder RA flag is basically a flag that stub rotors put in the router advertisement that basically just say, hi. This RA came from a stub router. This flag is not intended to be consumed by anything other than stub router. So if you are implementing something that is not a stub router, you're not supposed to set the flag and you're supposed to ignore This is not a general purpose flag for all stub routers that's specific to snack routers. So there are other things that people call of routers. That are not snack rotors. And, those things do not use the stub router flag host do not use the stub router flag. Host do not change their behavior based on the stub router flag. Purpose of the stub router flag is to accomplish 2 specific things. One is, that, a stub router might connect to infrastructure that has IPV that has no ipv6 service. And then ipv6 service shows up. Or a stub router could be connected to"

I'll I'll go a little bit more into the infrastructure prefix thing. Infrastructure prefix, is something that we want. We If we're a stub router and we're making ipv6 addressing available on the network, we have to do. Order for there to be routing between the stub network and the infrastructure network. We don't wanna be disturbing network. We want we don't wanna be, like, doing extra stuff on the infrastructure network that's unnecessary. And so if the infrastructure network is an ipv6 network, then we would like to just consume the ipv6 that's already on the network and not produce our own ipv6 network for the network. Ipv6 addressing for the network. So we'll advertise an RA on that network and that RA will cons will include a route to the stub network. But, If there's ipv6 on the infrastructure network, it will not include a PIO to be used on the infrastructure network. So, however, if if there is no ipv the infrastructure network, and it will include a PIO. And so the whole point of this the bit for this particular use case is just to avoid the situation where we have 2 different Stubborners fighting over who's gonna publish the prefix. We can each stub router can see that the other prefix is from another stub router, and we have an algorithm for which sub router vows out.

So back in the 24, I feel like I'm dating myself back in 24, 62 days, had a lot of implementations when the aid when the flags would flop, they would kill their DHCP client or turn it off and on and do all kinds of Really weird thing. So that text got removed from 4862 slack. Haven't seen that in over a decade. Haven't seen anybody doing any of that.

And there's code that Yoshi Fuji wrote in 2000 whatever that does this in Linux and The problem is that implementations, by the way, are gonna look at the interface flag Okay? They're gonna do RTM, they're gonna do RTM, get, like, ask me how I know. Right? They're gonna do RTM get link, and they're gonna say the interface flag persisted by the kernel, the value is x.

There's a there's a there's a lifetime. Well, the lifetime of something in that array. Talk The the bits don't have a lifetime. That's the problem. Well, the the the RA has a the router there's a router life applies to the root of default router. Does not apply to the flags. The flags have, like, no way to clear them and no lifetime. They're a disaster. This is why she's Matt. So to answer your question, gonna wanna know. Just horrible. But Okay. Okay, the an implementation might well look at the current value of the flag because the kernel does persist it.

So, yeah, people's work in this area. It's been discussed on the list. We have very similar requirements for CPU is already. But first of all, it's only 2 CPs. Right? I'd like I think ideally it should apply to every router which is sending queries. Because, like, when you say CPE, you're normally talking about, I don't know small Home routers, like, small medium businesses, but this also applies to, like, a huge enterprise boxes. Right?

So, I don't know how many of you were in the V Six ops when I was talking about how good would it be if router link local address, which is used for sending queries from could be specific for a prefix. Right? So when your prefix change, your link local change. So a logical router, a new logical router appears the host So and when we were discussing the draft, comments were amazed that, yes, in some cases, You might have multiple PIOs configured For example, it could be ULA's and global prefix.

Right? Let's say you two prefixes. It could be ULE or global or it could be actually 2 global.

Those arrays could come, it could generate your PVD, link local, pure PVD, or it could be in local pure like logical configuration or prefix and so on. They did is again, ensures that for each prefix, you have a different next hope. This is actually in line with what C28. The brands draft, IRC about, like, multi home and can host. So, yeah, yeah, 8028. So, if we'd like host to prefer default gateway per prefix. Right? It's exactly what we need to do. And here is actually when we're in conflict with Slack.

Yeah. Automatically, if you because from For enterprise stuff, it's actually kind of what you can fig you can configure that. No. Right? So that's my question. It is if you don't configure it, what's gonna happen. Like, a lot of those enterprise routers do not have default link local addresses the same way. A user has to set them. Some way. So my question is, is it, like, gonna automatically make those link local addresses, or are you somebody to actually go in and configure link local addresses for every prefix.

Suresh Krishna, So, Jen, I I like the text in the draft, but the stuff you showed on the slide. That's a difference for the must immediately stuff.

But, like, what is what 4060 on does Like, it has a desync with a random timer so that if there's, powder or something. Like, all the RA's don't go at the same time. So, like, the So the word I'm objecting to is immediately, right, because it's actually algorithm specified with the max I think it's called, like, max as long as you say, like, initial. So it's do this. Must do one with algorithm specified for the initial becoming inter advertising interface, I'm good with that. Okay. okay. Maybe in this case, we might want to reduce max So maybe this interval because I think 16 seconds is a way too long. That that's fine. No. But but the max initial dot, there's no interval is different than max route. I'm saying. You can write me the smaller one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Yeah. I know. It's 16 seconds. That's what Make sense. Yeah. Runs completely. The reason why Reuters send, Send lots of route advertisements, is that mobile nodes drop them?

This this one here, I don't see a conflict. I mean, the intent draft, 6 months slack Renum was like, don't send stuff that you forgot to send Like, just please send everything that you have just to make sure that, like, notes can make decisions. I don't think there's a conflict because if you put separate link local addresses, you can say, oh, please send everything that you sent before from this link local. And I think that's you can, like, resolve for the if you go back to the complicated slide with lots of lots of text on it, lots of link local addresses. I do wanna say, you know, what, you know, to how, to what degree are we sort of, like, reengineering the PVD Right? Because, like, the PVD option was basically intended to do this. I know maybe we've given up on that option ever being deployed. I don't know. I do see the attractiveness of this because it'll just work and it'll trigger 55. But we did think that we would do this using Pbd options. So that's something to think of. The funny thing, actually, I do not think that 4861 prohibit. Like, I don't see anything prohibits us from doing this right now. Right? So that's, like, we we can do it Yeah. So I that's why, like, I'm not even sure, like, the first part update of 4861 definitely belongs here. The part of sending arrays per prefix is actually might be purely 6 ops. Still draft, right, because but it's only here because I found the text and Kringham, saying please send everything in the 1 bracket and 4861 kind of saying router may put everything in one packet or may say different arrays. So because 4861 tends to mix protocol specification and their outer behavior, It's a kind of gray area where it should be old, but I'm happy to have that part in V Six ops clearly."

Certainly, I think that the experts here should update the document we shouldn't just publish some random document that someone comes in with, but I feel like any sort of"

I mean, if the IETF has consensus to publish a document grade. but, I I don't I think that if the IETF had consensus to publish a document, it would result in more cases where MPTV 6 would be implemented where it's not needed. And that's my concern. I think MPTV 6 has some serious problems. I don't want it to I don't want it to become commonplace the way that Nat became commonplace. I think the market pressure for NPTV 6 is way way Way less than the market pressure for Nat, And so I don't think that we're at risk in the same way that we were for Net. I think that a lot of the energy behind this is because people are frankly have been badly burned by now. And so we're afraid of a repeat of that. I don't think we need to be that afraid. So that's kind of where I'm coming from with this. I'd really like us to just solve the problems that we need to solve if if nptv6salt I haven't heard that it's genuinely solved a problem that that I think it's the right way to solve that problem. So I I don't think the working group should adopt this. Okay. Lorenzo. I think, I mean, the the the the the the the status I would prepare over experimentalist historic. But, okay. Now that no one now everyone's rule ruled me out because I'm a zealot. Okay. So I So I I, yeah, I would definitely agree with that. I think this is actually it it is actively harmful. And I, I have a have said on the list that, you know, what we do when we implement that as network operators, are we your putting we are moving cost, implementation cost,"

So we sort of, I suppose the closest we get to that is is is folks like Ted and myself, coming here as OS implement to say, no. This is not okay for our users. So things, you know, while Nptv6 is kind of like more stateless, than than than than that, it is actually still very damaging application developers. One thing that you can't do, for example, is if you don't know your own IP address, you can't build peer to peer app. Right? So it's actually very painful arab developers are not something I think we should inflict on them. Now the the reasons that have been given for for, for this needing to be deployed now are essentially 2, I think, 2 of the I feel 2 of the last remaining problems that we still have not yet solved in in in in ipv6 deployment land, and they are basically this SME multi homing problem. And the and the renumbering problem. And I think We sort of, we just haven't gotten to those problems yet. It's not because we don't want solve them, but before that, we had to solve residential, then we had to solve mobile Now we're solving enterprise, right, you know, with ipv6 mostly kind of maybe we even make this grand bargain with DHCP and we we we we put the Slack versus, you know, the HBV 6 debate behind us using PD. And and, like, the last two problems, we will get to them. Right? You know, 5.5 in Linux is coming. That that the Mac OS iOS and Windows already do it. And that kind of does solve multi homing. I also wanna point out that if we solve multi homing using something like this, we're gonna give up the ability to use something like MP quick to do better multi homing that we can we need to do better than what we did in pv4, and we have that within reach. We just need to wait a little bit longer to let those solutions get into the market. And in the SME we don't have that pressure right now. wait a little We need bit longer. to Rangel. Thank you.

I'll be quick. Tommy Jensen, 3rd client OSNQ, I guess. There are times to publish manuals for foot guns to prioritize 2 tow order. I don't think this is one of them. Because there are they will have long repercussions that will be stuck with. And we're like Lorenzo said, so close. And I say that as, you know, showing up with in B6 off saying, Hey, we're gonna do that thing Android did 10 years ago. Right? Like, We're all moving. I and our customers will look at the and all. Just kidding. No. They won't. They'll see an RFC and then ask us to do it. K. Nick, Okay. So as one of the people that is co authoring this, and the person that actually prided the original folks to, you know, to be involved I think there is validity to some of the things that people are saying here. I think that it It's being inflated a little bit. So there there is an actual problem with the draft that this update addresses. And that is the, ICMP error handling So some of that is fixed. Actually, that is fixed in the update. However, if looking through, some of the criteria for what the status is, and I I did put a lot of this on the list that I would encourage people to go and read, we need to def we need to answer a handful of questions. If this is experimental, what defines SES, So we went ahead and defined what we thought success looked like and, evaluate it against that. If that's not agreed upon, then we can go and reevaluate those things. I also think that While this does solve some multi homing problems,"

So The fear I think from what I'm hearing, is fairly is that this will blow up like map 44 did. I think if we word it correctly, then we minimize that to the point where it's already at Right? It doesn't really get any bigger. And if you look through the the, way that the, that my understanding of the way that the, categories fit, it really fits it it should if defined as a successful mirrorment, then it should be changed to either informational or historic. I don't think it meets standard people may argue that that it does, I think only think that it it that it needs to be, as a standard. I think it probably needs information from just based on the reading of the criteria okay. Thank in you. We're we're two people the out of time and have queue. So Torolas and Jared, let's go quickly. Right. I I think, it might be useful for you for to check out the, use cases in industrial. It coming from, you know, static ipv4netting, which is used extremely much to build large machinery. We don't have an IPV solution for that. I don't think I've heard explanation, anything to the contrary. And, as far as the the counter position is concerned, I would really love to see a good summary of the counter position because Obviously, if we can live without net, it would be great, but trying to find it from many places. So please, you know, the summary section opposing view, but then again, you know, I'm looking for the industrial case I'd love to see what the best solution for them is. Thanks. K. Jared? Yeah.

I really see these types of things important for not only an enterprise multi homing, but I think if we even look at the earlier stuff about, you know, when do you link local and stuff like that and how to actually configure devices. I think it's unlikely that people are gonna be able to use ipv6 to natively configure many of their devices because of, MD and S name collisions, and, discovery issues around that. Absent you know, us or possibly giving a supportive way to do, you know, this or, Nat 66. So just Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you Tarla, I think you're next. Okay, sir. What's his title number? The title validation paper. Consideration, Debt. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Hello. So this this isn't, a draft yet you know, past 8 minutes. Asking to be be adopted or just a discussion about, you know, if or how could we get there? So I'm trying to represent a small oppressed minority of people who think that 8 bit for QS for the whole internet of billions people is not good enough, right? We have overused, app used, reused and, messed around with DSCP and ECN bits and those eight bits are just not enough. And so, you know, especially with the wonderful extension header a draft that we all need to review and shepherd and everything, hopefully, there should be better way out of this situation to allow much more, you know, experimentation, deployment, and so of more advanced newer QS mechanisms, but it's not really, I think, sufficient to wait for an individual working group to come up with a particular proposal, but I think we we also need to think about how we create a framework in, in the extensions header"

Where I have these questions in terms of, you know, hop hop header destination header. So I've I've I've written a lot of these questions up. So if if you're really interested to help, please come to, and talk to me about that, that that would be lovely. From the dead net perspective, next slide, we, are currently in the process of evaluating a lot possible, you know, improved, control latency, mechanisms that would, need you know, additional metadata and packets beyond the eight bits that we have, in the in the task field. And they would all be different. And we do know how difficult high speed heart when everything is. So the more commonality we have in in these solutions in the packetization, the better it would be. Now there is no consensus at all. What, how, and if to, adopting that net. So this is really trying just to parallelize the work we're doing in dead net with the better understanding of what we're we be allowed by 6 man standards, to do in the packet header. So next slide. So the idea was, can we come up with a single header, extension header or even 2, you write a 1 hop by hop, one, destination option header, creating a new registry, making it a lot easier to be extensible while also commonizing the parsing so that multiple different mechanisms do not incur same, initial cost to try to figure out if all the hardware that we have in the field can support them. Right? So there is basically method, which would be registry, then then we to figure out what are subparts of the registry for standards informational and so on, right? I've even in the draft, have a configured way, Right? So that basically would allow us, to have a common approach and, then leave the actual, details of like in the same way we did with the SAP, which mostly has been done"

Next slide. yeah, so destination option, very same, So, idea about that. So that's basically the discussion point, help by and destination option header. Next slide. So this is basically for for folks from six men who don't want to go to, to, to dead net and get killed by strange algorithms. Be, getting a little bit of an idea of what would be potentially. None of these have been endorsed by that net. Right? This is all what different offers feel our good a good algorithm, sometimes really with high speed, testing. Right? So you see parameters like a service rate, finish time, cycle numbers, deviation. So it's basically all about the scheduling of packets in a stateless fashion, hop by hop, to achieve a better QS outcomes than we can do with the, current mechanism especially also in large scale networks. Next slide. Right. And, Now we're coming mostly from Netnet. In the past, I've seen a lot of interest. We've got as late as as early as 2000. Ian Stoecker coming here and trying to present his breakthrough work in QS and, the draft was great, but then, yeah, header for ipv6 just go away. Right? So I think this is not, limited to dead net, but I think, hopefully, we'll also find over time more interested people from the congestion control side. And I think there are a lot of congestion or control problems that haven't been resolved because we have such a big backlog, right? So, better up speeding, for example, better AQM feedback. So that would all benefit from more than the well, 2 bits we actually have for ECN, right, which were already way over taxing with Alphoras. Next slide. Right. So there were 2 great discussion points from Tim Shown and, and Tom Herbert So I've been trying to, to summarize this here, but I don't want to go into all these, these details but that's going to be feedback I'm going to put into the next version."

We as 6 men could give up, let's say, these 64 bits to, the, the QS world, to build better QS algorithms for our flux That's it. Thank you. Okay. Greg doesn't secure. Greg Merskate Erickson. So, yes, thank you for, pointing out that the death net does not the slide with debt net perspective does not reflect the debt net working group agreement. Guess. So that's very important because otherwise, it's misrepresentation. Another thing is that, I would like to point out the QS for Detman has been discussed, and there is at least for the adopted solutions over the IP data laying an MPOS date to lane. There is no, apparent agreement that, anything that beyond the existing up, up class of service, markings is required. It seems that might be what you are referring to is, not really QRS, but network resource partitioning. Identification. And there are still, ongoing discussions, but they are outside of that networking group. That net is not really right now interested in these discussions.
