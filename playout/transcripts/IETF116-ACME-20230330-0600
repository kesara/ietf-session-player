Is any help needed to progress the feedback for acne integrations to basically work their discusses. K. Don't think so. The authors are not in the room. I'm unlocking. And while we're looking I wanted to ask Do we know when the d work... Where when that document that we're relying on, d and new Id when that's gonna get published.

Next slide, you can see that we have been adopted So I want to thank everyone for taking the time to review this and express your Thank you for your support. For mentioning all the use cases that you have for for Dns account one. And for going through the process of actually actually voting in the adoption call. Moving on in the next slide. I just have some feedback that we have had since then the first one was in the abstract that it was not very clear we made some changes to the text, and it was also So we receive similar feedback about we mentioned delegation but people felt like we needed to mention c name records explicitly.

They have not been submitted to the data tracker yet. But I'd plan to do this after we aggregated everything. And then there was a a discussion in a github issue that you can click there on the slides and go to. And this was about changing the design a little bit But eventually, we decided to remain with the current one. I would ask you if you want to continue this discussion to place do on the and the Is aware of that. Maybe they github have issues is not the the ideal place for this. But it's however you want and whatever is best for you. And then we had this single comment about authors and it was more like why you. You have so many and what contributions were I'm not sure what to do about that. So I haven't done anything but if you think there is something to be done there, I am happy to to listen. And in the next slide, you can see what we have heard in terms of support so far. Content delivery networks have expressed a lot of interest in this including during the adoption call. And then we had Cas, whatever this may mean for you. And some cloud providers we had to cloud providers that are interested in implementing this or use a variation of want to move to the to the standard version. And few clients.

You just delegate get you other the same name to under underscore me this challenge to them. And then they manage certificates for you. And they acknowledge that this this limits you this you cannot solve basically challenges yourself. If you do that the acknowledge that this draft exists. And it would help them to have a better offering. And in the final slide, you can see that as I said, last time Google trust services has enabled this challenge. In their production and test servers. But to tell you more about what the our services are doing in this direction. I'd like to quickly invite a amir to tell us more about that. Oh So this is a mirror and I'm acting as a note taker as well, and I think Aaron was gonna be the other note So I won't be taking notes for this section if anyone wants to take over here. So Google trust services, we have, I believe two ac high implementations of Dns account one. Just various different place of it. And we've enabled it in part of our production servers. Also have a patch ready for the Go standard library to bring this in as a first class offering into the go programming language. So, yeah, We will have that ready for the one.

That's all I had for this session for the updates. So we are open now to any feedback any questions you may have in the room. Or Anyone? Not all. Maybe I should put my hand up. So there's no issue with the number of authors. Right? Like, that shouldn't be an issue. Right? There's one, two, three, four, five, five authors on this draft. Five is five is generally okay. When we when you get beyond five, it starts look like a physics paper and And there's some objection Okay. That's great. You think That that's that's good enough for me. Thank you. Okay.

Since London There's been a few discussions about a rats draft has an mean encapsulation format instead of using the web and I forget the conceptual message proper. I can put drafting chat. I still have a preference for web because it That is already standardized. I'm inter linking the two standards two different of drafts in different working groups. Seems like not necessarily the best idea. I think that's really been only discussions have happened since London. Okay. Thank you. So as far as I can see Aaron didn't either join or answer our mail.

My ellsworth worth So I'm putting in a kia attest station draft to lapse that we didn't have time to talk about yesterday but it's trying to propose a, like, entirely x five zero nine based kia attest station format sort of aimed at cab forum daylight iron in Hs type use cases. I don't know if Brennan if we wanna talk and coordinate, because I think our work is quite similar. About coordinate. Of the I think Challenges just has been getting more feedback. On this my use cases, I'm supposed not cab, but enterprise Tk I which I think has slightly different use cases. But I think aligning all of the attest station and issues work years useful. So happy to meet a few have prefer. Right. And I'm I'm fully aware that I'm, you know, trying to add yet another attest station format into the chaos. Fully fully aware of that and try to do it gracefully, but you know, we're coming from a world that doesn't really clint web end doesn't really implement sea with, like something's more friendly to the tool sets we barely have. Yeah. Anyway if we could maybe communicate offline or have a phone call or something know, helpful for me. There's another drafting in lapses well. Related to this. Carl Wallace and Shu drive Yeah. Talking about talking with them also. There I think more how you take a, like, opaque blob and jam into a Csr. Not actually spying a format, I think. Got. Okay. Yeah.

I don't have slides. So I will just talk at you and try and keep price. So my draft is a short to better to define how Ac is used to issue certificates for tall hidden services. This is already something that to C do dig search and Har, which is a Greek research university. For the most part I've taught and the services camp head service can be treated as any other service, but there are some complications and consider consideration such as the complete lack of Dns for things like c a account binding.

And also, there's the In the C browser forum requirements, there's an additional method of verifying tool hidden services where the certificate signing request is signed by the key of the tool hidden service. Because the domain name of the hidden services to derived from that key. That proves control. Over that domain. And enact there is currently no the Csr staff is entirely joined from the authorization of the label. So the the the straw force also addresses. How to joined those two things together into one step in this specific validation case. This this my first internet draft. So I do apologize for any mistakes I've made. But I would appreciate some feedback either here or come find me later or only on the mailing list. And whether you think this would be appropriate for adoption by actually working right? So can you just repeat the draft name? Draft my sole ac onion. Okay. Spelled m I s e l out. As long as it has ac, the third qualified It's good. No. Okay. Good. Okay. Thank you. So no questions?

If there are questions and concern discussed in the list until consensus. What we do tag, So like, basically, like I was wondering are we ready for it's actually working group last call. No it was just adopted a few weeks ago. So The problem we have with many Well medium energy working groups is that documents don't get enough fruit. Review. And sometimes, yeah, we do a working group last call and just to drive people to review it. I think this is a bit early for the dns zero one. Thanks. Sounds maybe we could get a commitment to to have some people read it or maybe we already have people in the group here that aren't insured reading yet. So let's start with the obvious this question to how many people have read that dns zero one draft other than authors, of course, just raise your hand. See about one hand. Yeah. That's...

We haven't had enough review for this and all I can do is encourage people to read it in the coming the coming a few weeks and then we can raise things Then we can raise things on the mailing list.
