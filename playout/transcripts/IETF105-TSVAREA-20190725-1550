    "text": "very interesting use case and then the the last sentence there was very interesting for me because when we started this I asked people why isn\u0027t anybody doing this yet why doesn\u0027t this exist and a lot of people said well it\u0027s a lot of work and we don\u0027t really have the map next slide so I think you what really helps take away a bit of that overhead in terms of work we recently did some some work on sp3 prioritization so in this the top visualization each row is an individual Q log file one web page load so each vertical rectangle is one quick packet and I really like this visualization because it immediately makes clear the differences between different prioritization approaches right and yet it only took me about a day to create this visualization based on the Q log formats so it\u0027s a lot of profit for not a lot of work the bottom one is even faster this was implemented by one of our pageant students in about two hours and really helped us to debug the prioritization implementation as we were going so I really like that Q log enables this kind of quick and dirty fast visualization that helps implement one of the some of the complex systems as well so we\u0027ve got a lot of good feedback we\u0027ve also got a lot of what I would call constructive feedback next slide so there are also people that say that there is some overhead I\u0027m a bit ashamed to admit that our own implementation gets very slow if we enable all the queue logging but that\u0027s because we\u0027re using javascript and a very crappy logging framework but still there is a cost some people still don\u0027t like json some people their implementations aren\u0027t fit to output queue long as we have it right now and then one of the most important ones is the one at the bottom is even besides the possible performance of red there is also a certain maintenance burden in adding this morning now something changes in quick you don\u0027t just need to update your business logic you also need to update your logging code and so they would rather wait until things settle down a bit I think that\u0027s quite ironic coming from people implementing quick write but it\u0027s still a very good point to make so next slide we\u0027ve seen that a lot of stacks that have these reservations right now still are trying to move towards key log they mainly do that by using what calling converters so they have some kind of an internal watering format they write a small program that transformed it into Q log so that they can use the tools this works just fine I think it\u0027s a good approach I think it\u0027s a nice way to eventually maybe get the browser I put into a cute or compatible form as well because I don\u0027t think they might want to implement you log directly but I am a bit worried about the maintenance burden for these converters down to one "
