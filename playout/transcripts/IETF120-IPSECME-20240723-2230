Was there a few seconds ago? but disappeared. So go-J chair. But he will probably come back now Or not All right, this is the note well and I assume you have seen it. We read it and understand it and there is more text in links that are visible So, I would like to peteros was said that he's going to be one note taker but I would actually like the people to help him and, you know add some more there's a note that you can go in there and just add there stuff and it would be useful to other people also to help him All right So here is our agenda. And as I can see if I have you minutes and three minutes sessions or slots We have quite a lot of items on the agenda. So we are going to be going through this quickly so it does anybody have anything to say about the agenda? Anything? changes or bashing or something Let's go forward. So I already had one version of this document saying that we have one document in Out 48 and then like two three hours ago there was an announcement that the RFC 9593 was approved. So now we haven't through RFCs published since last meeting And that means that we still have GI Q version two you know and the diet I diet ESP and that's a that that's the only thing that are left in our right"

So Paul, you are the first with the four different drafts Just say the next slide when you want to have a next slide. Next slide So this I came up with a while ago because there were customers that really wanted to know why a certain machine went down on them so that they didn't have to keep retrying if like you know they knew that there was going to be a server this missing for a while. So it's a very simple payload, delete re- to know why a certain machine went down on them so that they didn't have to keep retrying if like you know they knew that there was going to be a server that's missing for a while so it's a very simple payload delete reason last time I presented this my ask specifically do people on just an enum or also if or instead of free forum text? People of course said they want it both. So now both are there I did ask confirmation as well if they wanted a timer, where I someone could estimate like, you know, the downtime is going to be 60 seconds or 30, 600 seconds. So people like that too. So that's still there. So this is the format I am halfway implementing this for Libus going to be 60 seconds or 3,600 seconds. So people like that too. So that's still there. So this is the format. I am halfway implementing this for Libreswan. Soon we can do, I wouldn't say interrupt testing because you just send this and if you don't know it and you just ignore it But like you can see that you receive it. So any feedback on the list would be great next slide actually I have comment for that oh okay sure so the deluge recent text which language it is which uh character set, and you know, all of these other things that are annoying about this.

We don't want to send them again to save a number of buyers on the wire. We did some minor fix Again, with a want to send them again to save a number of bytes on the wire. We did some minor fixes. Again, with all the protocols I work on, I get the protocol of D and spine number wrong if it's an Ike notified because of course it all has to be zero. So I made that mistake again. So I got fixed We renamed this spy to new spy to just make sure that people don't mix it up with this spy from the actual Ike notify itself Just some minor, minor cleanups And we also want to do some interrupt testing before we're going to ask for any kind of working group last call on this. So we're about to implement this I'm hoping somebody else will implement this too, so we can do some testing So next slide. Valerie. Valerie is in the queue. Oh, Valerie Hello actually I entered the queue before Paul started.

As it mike english only English, or it's a full range of languages, and that's one it's definitely not a like matter to deal with human languages. So I think that it is not a good idea to have a free-form type And I have also a concern whether these notifications really needed well in most cases you can guess what the reason why the PAD deletes an essay, but even if a peer informs you about the reason what you can do with it You can either log it or display to the user user, or use as a hint for network operator to fix up some problems But in the latter case, in any case, you will need to contact to the other side to get more information.

Like, you just know that they're gone. Like, if you're sending up a tunnel to, I don't know, like a gCP or a ws and you set up a vp tunnel you kind of can't really call up someone and said like hey why is my tunnel down so there are legitimate cases where customers of ours are like we would really like if the software would have given us some kind of reason and of course you're not guaranteed that the app of ours are like, we would really like if the software would have given us some kind of reason. And of course, you're not guaranteed that the admin will give the right reason. But like, if they shut down a machine, maybe you can get like, you know, the machine is being shut down that you might know that it will come back soon.

Let's take this to list. Yep. Okay, so we'll talk about that online yeah Hello, Alan Jarrett from Microsoft. I have some concerns of the lead reason, particularly with freeform text, you run the risk of opening up software to various types of injection, SQL injection tax, JavaScript injection attacks particularly if this is going to be displayed to a user somehow there's or log to somewhere to a database Sure, I cannot help you for log for J hours No, but my point simply is it. Introducing free checks without reason. We really need to provide guidance and how to sanitize it, or perhaps not do that No, I think it's implementation need to write guidance and how to sanitize it or perhaps not do that no i think i think i think it's it's implementation responsibility to do that like there is an enum so you can only decide, if you don't trust anything, you can just not log any of the reason and just stick to the enum. Like, the other one is just, an optional clarification. Right. What are any questions? on the SATS payload draft? Is that? Okay, so that next slide So this, I talked about last time about child PFS info This is basically the, we don't really know the property where the first IPSECSA that came in with the ICSA has any kind of PFS enabled or not because you didn't negotiate that first and you can only find out at the Riki So this is the specification of a payload that you can basically send in the ICA to"

So I think the most important question here is it's currently kind of only supports a list of valid KE methods for the, for the initial exchange, but we of course now have all this intermediate exchanges and all all the upcoming multiple k e exchanges and it can get quite complicated to convey that in the message So the question that I have for the group is, should we just only do this for the simple case or should we? go back to the drawing board and also try to handle all the much more complicated issues? Valerie, you're on the mic I knew that without looking so I think that in its car current form, yeah, is the notification is not very useful because it doesn't support the use cases when key exchange method are somehow tied to the other algorithms. Let me provide an example. For example, our implementations supports both research tied to the other algorithms. Let me provide an example. For example, our implementation supports both RSA AS SHAT2 and as well as ghost algorithms But a ghost key exchange method may only be used with ghost ciphers and for example AES may only be used with X X2519 to 5519 and and because they recite in the different cryptographic model So to express this policy, we need to tie key exchange methods with a particular set of ciphers and pair of function So it's impossible to express. Okay, so I understand that there's many complicated scenarios where this doesn't work, right?"

But where we really wanted this was the fairly simple use case of the IOT case that also does the previous slides re-keying without any, without doing the whole S essay and only doing the new KE. And so for that, use case, people are really trying to save the amount of bytes They really don't want to do a re-key that then fails and then they have to do a new re-key because they got the parameters wrong So I think it is important that we have at least a fix for the simple use case, even if it doesn't cover the more complicated use cases. And again, let's take it into the list to see if there's a way we can add these complicated use cases or whether we should just give up on them well let's may provide one comment for the way is take it into the list to see if there's a way we can add these complicated use cases or whether we should just give up on it. Well, let's me provide one comment. For a very simple use cases, it's enough to provide a single bit. A single bit will be worth the key exchange methods are identical to those use for ICSA. It's then cover the 99% of the settings And you don't need all the list of key exchanges single bit. So I think this will cover more settings, most configurations Okay, so I'm not, because audio is not very great for the people standing in front of the room so let's take this on list but I think you said like you wouldn't need a list, but we would only need the one, the one that we decide on But let's take this off the list, and I'll start a threat there. Thank you So next slide And then just the, the entry will be a notification. So this is basically a payload that we wanted to have so that we can say that there's not replay protection support enabled and then you can behave slightly differently. And specifically, the question for this draft was, should we also add a payload where we basically say the implementation can treat extended sequence numbers separately from the anti-replay?"

    "text": "because then you can actually negotiate extended sequence number and not the replay If those two are tied together, then you, even if you don't want replay and to replay you must negotiate anti-replay or you must use anti-replay because otherwise you can do ESN. So I think there's value in conveying both of those. So the current draft only conveys one of them and we're looking at adding the second one there as well. And then we'll come back to the list as well for more feedback so I think that you are improved interpreted the RFC 303 3043-03 because it says that when you use extended sequence number, you should enable entry, not use extended sequence number, you should enable entry play, not must, but should. They can be decoupled and it's a case that you use ESN without enter protection You just need to maintain on the receiver a single value of the current upper half of ESN And don't need to maintain a slide window. Yes, but as many implement- that do not do that separately. So for instance, the Linux kernel cannot separately do ESN unless you also enable anti-replay. That probably fixed Linux kernel, not Right, this document. So one of the other problems, the questions I have, that's GI question too also wants to disable replay prevention at some point and I think you should look at that also. And there was also discussion about earlier that somebody will actually say, we should also have a method of sending, you know, 64 bits you know full ESN in the sequence numbers so that would be also useful for that so so i think we should bring up this to the list and you know talk about there.

So yeah, just a record problem statement Unfortunately, if UDP and CAP is not used, ASP packets, especially in IPV6 world, do not share for you with ICC, right? So, Ike might be successful, and then when you try to send it actual data, ASP packets are dropped We've seen it for various reasons, including firewall bugs or firewall police and so on right and it looks like it's quite hard to detect an application and hard to recover and normally results in general unhappiness and the negative user experience. Next slide please. So, what's proposed? What we're proposing is to introduce so-called ESP echo request, which would use the reserve test API 7 and next header 59 which means like no next header and the ZAPIR would just respond with echo reply packet with SPI aid next header 59 which means like no next header and the peer would just respond with echo reply packet with SPI 8 and next header 59 and we'll copy data from accurate request up to the MTU which would also allow to detect some empty issues next slide please So, yeah, so we presented it last time Before presentation, I think we had quite useful discussion on the list During the session, we got some feedback and we addressed it I believe, in particular, the main change to the document is a dedicated section clarifying"

Well, obviously, it does not guarantee that real ISP packets will go through because those P pins are using reserved packets, but the same way we do in a normal network troubleshooting right, when I ping a destination it doesn't mean my quick or HTTP packets could go through but it does help to detect some obvious network brokeners. Yeah. So basically, in it doesn't mean my quick or HTTP packets could go through, but it does help to detect some obvious network brokeners. Yeah. So basically, it's for mechanism for endpoints to do some initial discovery. It's troubleshooting mechanism for network administrator and in theory it also could be used to maintain firewalls state entries in case of timeouts at all. Next slide, please so what we also clarifying in the text that fallback scenarios, what to do if ESP ping failed So sender might actually fall back to some other mechanism, for example, it could use a So sender might actually fall back to some other mechanism. For example, it could use in CAP, it could use different IP protocol, what I mean? we can fall back from IPV6 to IPV4 right? Or try to use another interface in case of multi-homed host or try to use different distance right because it might not be the only available means for the device to establish APX And we clearly see that if there is no other means, the client should still, device should still use ASP, because maybe in the network, you're doing something strange with ISP packets with reserved SPIs, but actual data might go through. So it's still trying to send ESPs better than doing nothing but if you can do some with reserved SPIs, but actual data might go through. So it's still trying to send ESP is better than doing nothing, but if you can do something else, please try.

So hopefully we can get it done quickly First of all, thank you for providing your skills cases and I fully understand the use case when these tools can be used for manually used for operator to check the ESP connect but when what about the use case when it is used used before the IPSEC? estate establishment, it leaves? a lot of questions basically reading the draft, the algorithm looks like you first try is beeping. If it works it's okay. If it doesn't work, it's okay we'll try to instead you first try ESP pink, if it works, it's okay. If it doesn't work, it's okay, too. We'll try to establish ESP in any case. So in this case, it is questionable why would the user usefulness. And a little to establish ESP in any case. So in this case, it is questionable why would the usefulness. And a lot of questions is left about whether ESP ping is intended to be used periodically or only it's beginning before the IPsecretary is established And I also think that it's probably an encrypted USB Pink defined in the other document can be useful to check the weather ESP can be handled by Internet provider after the ICSA is established.

Let me answer the first one It's not like if it fails, we still do it anyway, right? You in my, it it's the only way you can talk to the remote side right you have only one interface you can have only one protocol, yeah, then you still do it anyway But if you have multiple ways to establish IPSEC, failure of ESPP PIN might indicate that you should actually try to do something else right the most common case it's actually falling back to V4. It's kind of happy eyeballs right? So your V6 doesn't work. Let's try V4 right? It might be not as good, but at least it have an indication that it works, right? right um so what was the next comment i the next comment was that it is unclear whether this extension should be used whether the ESP pink should be used only one before the epicase step established or periodically after the ESPSA is established. I don't know if it finds that currently. So it's definitely intention to use it before establishing And but one of the use cases are saying you can use it to keep a state in the firewalls, because in some cases you"

Well, and I think that mobile case is not described in the draft, so the use case case is not described in the draft.

It's all it's it's the case when this ESP pink should be used. But I don't know.

It can be left up to implementation unless implementation could do something harmful if you think we need to more normative language on how to use this, yeah we can discuss this, but I read your comments as there is an interest in this work, right? Because we already talking about implementation mechanics and how to use this. So that's like actually my question is not how. The question is should we? right now? okay let's bring it to the Hi, christian hopps, yeah so just to reinforce that, I don't think any of these use cases, I certainly hope they're not normative right?

Use it how you want, and I think it's useful Thank you. Just one. Lorenzo Colleen, just wanted to quickly respond to, I think, Valerie earlier comment around should we use encrypted ESP ping instead? I think if you're trying to get a quick determination of whether that destination, is reachable using ESP, this is sort of better. You can do it as a pre-flight check. And if it doesn't work, you can simply fall back to a PV4 If you want to do encrypted ESP ping, you first have to do the icon check, you know, take the RTTs and then, you know, then you might discover that it doesn't work. And then sort of you have bad options. You basically have to tear down the session So, yeah I think, I think this would, um, it is sort of it's more suited to a sort of a pre-flight check And I think it does, it is more useful than the increase ESP ping in that sense paul wouters as an individual I actually disagree with that because I think what you should really do is you should fire off an Ike session over V4 and V6 in the happy eyeballs way and set up both and then if you find out three ESP Pings that one of them doesn't work, you just tear them down Because each one of them can actually carry V4 plus V6 traffic in the SA, in one essay. So you can do these in parallel and see, and while you've negotiated, them, you can tear one down after you do an ES3 ping and see that it doesn't work I one connection for billing purpose as well?

And if you're LTE, if your Wi-Fi drops off, you just route it into your L-D tunnel. So again, I don't think it's very important to support mobile. And the final question interfaces up. And if your LTE, if your Wi-Fi drops off, you just route it into your LTE tunnel. So again, I don't think it's very important to support mobile. And the final comment, I think we should implement it this, even for the simple reason that it forces Linux to find implement the you can either send and capsulate or none non-encapsulated packets on the same essay Okay, so I guess like i would really love to hear so more comments on the list, right? So I guess time wise, yeah, I'm done Yes, perfect. Thank you very much So the next one is encrypted ESPP PIN. So we will see what the difference is Yeah so I'm Anthony. I'm proposing an encrypted ESP ping and this is complementing to the previous one. I'm not against the previous one. This I think is just a different use case So next slide please. I think of everyone knows this slide. Like ICAN ESP has different fate on the data plane next time And I think most of the, this is to diagnose after the IC is established And you have any SPI and you have encryption. You can all only send in encrypted payloads. And this is mostly like it is, if you have a heart, once you establish, and you start sending some packets and some packets doesn't get through, it's much harder to debug and recover from it.

Like we don't understand the IPT traffic, but ESP message as a ping if anyone was questions about this I can cover it I put up a diagram to explain Yeah, next slide So this can be used for diagnose the problem black hole, or one of the other use cases, if you have two tunnels, like one has back tunnel, primary and secondary tunnel, you can often send on one tunnel one way, but how do you specify? like you want the response on specifically on one return? path, like if you have two return parts. And this case also can be useful, I think, the mobile use case and you can figure out if the which paths are supports it and return path pro be useful I think the mobile use case and you can figure out if the which path supports it and return path probing is one of the specific things for this and this was I see it done in other use cases such as MPLS and LSPS, some similar problems. But the use case is not encrypted. It's always encrypted so we can specifically request requesting the return path becomes a bit tricky like I'll show come cover it more in the implementations.

And then you have a simple ping like thing identifier, sequence number, and optional data This is very close to the previous one, as well as the typical ICMPP ping, V4, V6, or anything else next slide and this is defined two different subtypes Subtype, one is echo request and the other one is echo response.

The advantage of it, the next slide. So if you use that payload, you can derive a lot more metrics, like one-way delay, loss rate, even potentially, you can also derive the estimated bandwidth which because doesn't 100% agree with me but we will see when we get that.

The second part, the reverse path in a simple thing, it becomes a detours. Like, you send a 150 byte packet and the return rest experience over there, one slide coming back, the second part, the reverse part, in a simple thing, it becomes a dedos. Like you send a 150 byte packet, and the return response you're expecting is more than that which I think is a very hard thing to propose inside the idea of anything which amplifies the traffic is has to be done very carefully like if I don't if I don't not do it So the first part I agree then the next one is we were still ambient when we wrote the draft we were still ambival and do we want to announce it in the Ike negotiation so that the peer knows it or not and today I'm like this deciding, okay, next version we are going to say, like, peer should announce it Lawrence has something to say now? No, can keep going Yeah, next slide so the question of mic, last is a return path association? It's a bit tricky. I don't know if it's only Linux specific, but the Linux really implement essays as two unidirectional essays. So when the XFARM stack gets a response and you request an SPI itself has no, there's no way of correlating. This is a response to say for. And even thinking like, should I allow this response via the backup? path or the primary path? And I talk to Linux maintainer and he's, well, we'll think about it adding the list of not. Like, you do figure out some way of like correlating the which essays should is allowed as a return path forward for that simply which essay should is allowed as a return path forward.

Yeah, just Lorenzo, I'm wondering, like, could you use this? packet format to like before I negotiation and basically do what the other draft is doing, right? I don't see any reasons not doing. I was a bit concerned, I was wondering, like, if the IPTFs guys don't say it, I think you can. I didn't want to be the one proposing it. You said. I see. So it's because like, technically, TFS you're only used after I can agree argumentation. I don't think we can define it this way, like the TFR is very flexible like and we just say like this unencrypted and I think there is potential to be combined this. I mean we won't be breaking any existing implementations because they'll just reject it. And we could use the, we need some spice to use, but we could just use seven and eight, right? Spies, you will need spice seven and eight still, but if you use the same form then we can just add a switch saying like this is encrypted this unencrypted. Okay, let's talk Just say that TFS is going to meet TFS? will have to care there. I reread it many times, but what you're the implement right? How are you paired it in the Linux kernel? The patch is good on, so would you like to answer that? Yeah It's only thing you're about it neat, just quick, so in order to do congestion control, we have to know what the return essay is So we're going to have to figure out some way to associate the sending and receiving essays for IPTFS congestion control Only for congestion control. Non-consestion control, you don't need to pay it up. That's correct. So you haven't implemented that part So I still don't know even in congestion control how you would pair it"

So this is about a getting code point for beat mode and so the LAIETF 118 I propose this one which is going to standardize the beat mode completely. And along with that, we were going to get an IQV2 code point in the same draft. Then we discovered some covers the beat mode, basically so we don't need to do all those work so I split up the draft now to only to focus on the Iquito negotiation for an existing ESP protocol ESP beat mode for last 10 years So next slide, that's why I already covered that, next one So just a refresher on the beat mode is an end to end mode, and it is widely used for last 10 years and it saves a few bytes, and it's also a helps in mobility use case with the drones or it also helps if you want to use from different IP addresses when used without like negotiation And that's a well-known use case in the hip RFCs And the minimal IPSEC implementation, 930 also supports it but yeah negotiation was never discussed there also. So that's why we're coming back to in a very late stage to get Ike negotiation Next slide software support has been there for 15 or whatever the long number of years. Linux support said, there are a few fixes coming along, but otherwise it still works widely used use case Thanks one along, but otherwise it still works widely used use case.

You can publish it, you can have it AD-sponsored It doesn't even necessarily have to be the same AD that is the AD for this working group I hear there's one AD who knows quite a lot about IPSEC And there's, oh, it's just here Yeah, so what groups are here? are exist to do work.

So first, why in you? security protocol? So the thing is ESP is rather unflexible because it has no version number and so all the new features must be somehow negotiated what means that this is not transparent to the other network So we had already a lot of proposal to extend ESP so do here do that but all the suffered from those limitations So yeah, so we think we need to kind of something new Another thing is these days, hardware offloads are quite important.

Next Yeah, it was defining an RFC. I think it was back in 2010 and it was exciting a four-byed wrapper around ESP header and was seen as an age replacement I think the key feature here is the encryption flag, that means if that flag is set, the packet is authenticated and then encrypted. If it's not said, it's outcended but not encrypted So what that means in that case, you can parse the inner pack from the other network, but it's kind of a switch on, switch off thing which is, yeah, I don't like that much But anyway, so in contrast to ESP, the rap ESP has a two-adversion number, which is quite nice because you can just bump that number and redefine it heads headers, and that's what we're planning to do here. Okay, next So that's how the original rap DSP looks like. So it starts with the next header and header length. That's essentially that you can find the next heron in a packet. And then it has a trailer length that tells you how deep you can parse into the packet So the packet format is shown below So it's integrated check up to the USB header and encrypted depending on the encryption flag So next slide So let's have now a quick look at the Google PSP PSP Next. Yes, so essentially PSP is inspired by IPSEC If you look at the specification, that immediately comes clear. So I mean, the most things are adopted from there. So, but it was made so that it's kind of hardware of float friendly and it is used for data center security Oh, these are all sides.

It starts with the next era header and the header length and it has a crypto offset defined It has a version number and two rather known fields. This is the SBI and the IV And it has additionally a virtual network identifier defined. Next slide So the interesting fields here are the crypto offset With that crypto offset you can expose something from the inner packet to the outer network Then it has a version number that essentially encode the crypto parameters like all-ridden type and keylands and that's for status description on the RRX side for PSP. And this has the VNI, which is essentially a flow identifier and to notice here um so psp has no sequence numbers, so reproduction is autoscope for PSP. Okay next. So let's come to the wrap ESP as we define it here So essentially, rap DSP is not widely used but it has already a protocol number, and it has this version number what we can just bump and define the headers to our needs. And it turned out that it can be done like PSP and even more important and it can carry integrity protected flow information. And additionally, to that, it can preserve the original use West Coast of West partially at least Next slide. Okay, that's how it the original use case of West partially at least. Next slide. Okay, that's how the header is looking like. Again, we have next header in Herderland the crypto offset is adopted from PSP, and then we have variable options in between before the ESP header is following And to mention here is the packet format unlike the original West packet format, the Integrity Check is up to the WESP parallel. So we cannot wrap out the West parallel with knowing the IPSEC keys, but that was intentionally here"

So we have next header and header length field like most extension headers have. So we are complete to IPVX in case we need that Next slide. So and the crypto offset, as mentioned, so if the crypto offset is zero as shown above here then the full inner packet is encrypted in contrast to the crypto offset is positive as it shown below. Then you can show some data to the other network as we here show showing your TCP header to the own network Okay, next slide. So the most interesting thing here are the options, I think they are GLV encoded and essentially adapted from IP physics extension header options, which means that you can add multiple options behind the header, what makes acquired flexible here. And also you can define new options if you need that, what we think it may kind of future proof. And additionally to that, we reserve some space for private options so if you want to transmit anything that is autoscow for standardization you can do with that next Okay, option types. We essentially define tree, which is padding, flower dining fires, and private options. So future documents can define more, but that's essentially what we have here in this document Next slide So padding we use essentially just to align the next header, but it could be also used for ciphertext alignment if anybody thinks it's necessary so yeah it's free to use this. Okay, next The most interesting options, I think, are float identifies. So they must carry carry characteristic information from the inner flow and they are put in front to, yeah, you can do ECMP with it or RSS, but we use the define any of those in this document"

Okay next slide. Yeah, okay, some takeaways from the IPSEG workshop and netafunch conference that happened last week. So we had quite a long discussion with the PSP developers from Google, from META and from Intel And yeah, as this slideshow, so we agreed us the Vespression 2 design fits the PSP use cases and the users are always to migrate to the standardized package for my once that available. We had quite some discussion about the crypto offset because they're well, maybe we don't need it if we just take a flow identifier that identifies the flow and put that in front that might be sufficient But the PSP guys said, well, no that will not fit our use case. We need that for telemark and that's mandatory for the PSP use case But I also said so they need to just pass up to the layer four header and never behind that So we could maybe say we must step behind that header Yeah, so that's basically all So next slide We can skip that one I haven't removed that in a new version.

    "text": "reason why you copy on decontas, you copy the outer ECN to the inner packet is so that the signal, the congestion signal, gets to the end host, right? And I think that 4301 had it been written this year, congestion, the transport people, would have said, you will absolutely do that, and there is no other choice. And I think the only reason we have an option is because 4301 was written whatever it was 15 years ago 20 years ago, and we didn't, ECN was still an experiment okay DSCP, is a I would say, a different kettle of fish And I think that there are many different reasons to do different things for that, including the fact that you're doing really, you know, leased line email in your VPN and you need, it has to have a, uh, quality of service that, but it has to carry traffic of many different qualities of service and so the argument for not copying them is relatively strong Oh, let's hang out here for a second michael zhou so my understanding, the reason you don't want to copy it is because it's not secured, right? So, like, an attacker, a bad guy, can basically set the ECN saying you have congestion, right? And then it affects your actual red traffic, right? Like, you get, you've got to, basically, if you're going site to site, right, you've got some red traffic on each side and you've got a TCP flow, and somebody on the black link can come and set the ECN and totally screw you TCP flow. That was my understanding Yes, you're again. Yes, you're right. That's a possibility"

    "text": "And they could, of course also just drop your packets to signal the congestion The fake condition the packets to signal you that there was congestion, but there wasn't really any congestion. Okay, so to me, on the whole, the public you that there was congestion, but there wasn't really any congestion, okay? So to me, on the whole, the positive, the receivers of the congestion signal need to be a little bit suspicious, period So that's okay. And the benefit of getting a congestion signal is probably, and maybe ignoring it, is probably, better than the risk that you mentioned And this is for, Daniel's thing is also for, you know, kind of you know, constrained environments where perhaps there isn't really another host that you're decapsulating to. It's not a gateway, it's an end hope I think, right? So maybe it doesn't matter where the signal is. Right They're giving it for the DC, DSEP I think the one of the reason they are not copied because they need to be because the meaning of the meaning of the inside your own network like be different that they are in the ISP network and it might be different so it's not rest right one to one mapping. All right. That guy Right understand that we have cases where we should do that and cases where we should not do that You're almost running around time. Go ahead, still one more a last question regarding the flow, what is it? different? There's D-S-C-A-P No, yeah, the flow level What we would like to do in order to compress that field is to come"

Thank you So the next one is then Frodoken the other working group. Right. Thank you. So the next one is then Frodo Ken, and I will be driving the slides. So just say next slide when you are this, when you are ready when you are ready hi. So here is Gwilling. Can you hear me? Yes we can hear you oh that's great yeah thank you So my presentation about how to use the Frodo in ICEV2. Yeah, next slide, please Yeah, so the first part is just about our dropped information you can find them So now I was talking about our motivation The main motivation is that we observe that cryptographic agility for PQ migration has been highlighted by many organizations yeah, like NIST, ETSI, BSI DOS, yeah, and actually, algorithm diversity is a very good reason, a very good thing to support cryptography agility. Yeah, so a very good reason, a very good thing to support cryptographic agility. So this means, yeah, if a number of algorithm is available, it's good for"

    "text": "application as well, because the better term for PQ algorithm is that, yeah different algorithms normally have different features Some of them actually efficient for computers but maybe not good for public size or maybe for cyber tech, etc you know as well i think yeah so this also actually efficient for computing, but maybe not good for public size or maybe for psychotech etc. Yeah, you know as well, I think. Yeah. So this is also good for security reason because for PQC algorithms actually the security analysis, we can say maybe not still very mature You actually probably already know some examples like the broken of a rainbow and also like the cycle, yeah, after a number of years have studied, so just found they are actually not secure Yeah, together with some new analysis yeah like by doctor cheney lane yeah something like one month ago. Yeah, the algorithm finally not work right, but it gave some concern about the security of even for legislation skills. Yeah, hopefully should be still okay. And the last part is, of course supporting a good size of different algorithm. It's also meaningful from the engineering aspects This means even some algorithms actually they are secure in algorithm design, but probably due to the engineering implementation they may have some flaws. Yeah, so if we have a number of algorithms to support and such algorithms can be actually implemented can be ready, have a backup for important protocols like ICEV2 or TLS. It should be good Okay, next one, please. Thank you Yeah, for this one, what we are going? to do is that we would like to use the flowdove though for ICEV2. Yeah, so"

    "text": "the good thing is that RFC yeah, 9370 already specified a framework that supports, yeah, we can use up to seven layers of additional KEF in IKEV2. Now this kind of additional KEM mainly means PQCKE Now also there is a draft yeah, by panel and a Geredo. This describes how to use the framework. Yeah with the Kiber M MLKM, KEM So now we would like to add one more algorithm, which is kind framework, yeah, with the Kiber, M-L-K-E-M. So now we would like to add one more algorithm, which is Kiber, which is freedom, sorry So you may also know that Fredo K-E-M is one of the three KEMs in the progress of IS Yeah, so next one please The main challenge for user Freedo is that the public size and also the sci-fi tax, yeah, for Fredo is quite large compared with Khyber It is something like the 10 times of the Khybers So in this table, we give the concrete number about the public key and a cipher tax of friedo compared with Kaiba. So from here, you can see the size of cybertext and public key of Fredo is about 10 times of Kiber. But the good thing is that I can even too already support some new message format called that Intermediate Exchange. It can support the large message, but the message size still should be less than something like the 65 king. But the good thing for Kaiba, the large one for level 5 security fraudul It is also just about the 22 key is for Kaiba, the largest one for level 5 security fraudul, it is also just about the 22 k-byte for the public K-byte is also just about the 22 K-byte for the public K and cybertaic.

Basically, the clients can ask several sets to run additional algorithms and the server can select one of them. Yeah, this part is about some questions, right? raised by Leo, but basically the comment is that Probably we don't need to specify how to use Froido together with Kaibati just specified Frodo In that case, the combination should be quite easy So we would like to say the suggestion or comments from other aspects All of them, most of them actually agree with this, we will remove this kind of combination Yeah, so the main thing is that we would like to say, especially, do we need to align with the AISO to acquire the centralization progress in PQC, KEM? Yeah, which group will do this? Because ISO is designed 3 three KEM algorithms So we need to know the progress because relatively ISO is quite close sensitization organization. Yeah I think that's all. We would like to invite for join our work if you are interested Also, your comments will very helpful yeah thank you all right thank you so let's go to the last one quickly because i don't think we had time for questions for that because we want to have have still one more present so well okay thank you Take your comments on the list Okay, so want to have still one more presentation so well okay thank you take a comment to the list okay uh so uh signature authentication in the iquiturian"

So you know that using sure algorithm any asymmetric cryptography can be broken So the next please And so it's a good idea to introduce post-quantum authentication into IQuito. So, it is possible to do this with the current post-quantum signature algorithm. So the next please Neast candidates selected for standardization are ML, for signature is MLDSA and is LH DSA. So from for known as delisium and Sphinx Plus So to the next please is MLDSA and ESLH DASA. So from former known as Delisium and Sphinx Plus. So this draft just leveraged the U use of this algorithm using using in RFC 7427 so it's a generic signature authentication method and defines a three levels of security for MLDS and for SLH DSA For MLDS, for MLDS, this is equivalent to 50 65 and 87 parameters so the NIST level 2, 3 and 5 And since the Maldi can be useful for both deterministic randomized signing mode, this draft specifies the deterministic mode should be used because IP2 includes a random nonce in terms of research session, so in any case the input will be randomized and depend on the session.

Thank you Okay, we have about two minutes Hi, Paula, speaking as the non-responsible AD On Thursday at the SAC meeting, we're having a talk about crypto protocols, crypto in IETF protocols about what we should do with the various cryptographic algorithms and whether or not they should get an RFC number or not.

But anyway, so let's bring most of these questions that are on the comments of people have to the list. And I would actually like to have Paul to actually start, you know, cheaper trades for all of your troughs and you know think about whether they are ready and should we start of you know adoption calls or last call or whatever for each of them and them and yeah yeah yeah and yeah yeah yeah the problem is that I don't have time You don't have two chairs Oh, yeah, I got to look at and I said, physical interoperating in health situation Virtual introvert. No you didn't say any word virtual. All right but I think it's the mailing this still better Yeah, I've allowed was virtual. All right, but I think the mailing is still better. Yeah, I will ask for two hours next time We have been, we had the first, you know, one hour and we didn't feel it first and then we started one and half hours and we didn't fit And now we are overflowing your half hours already. So two hours next time. All right if that's all I think then we are finished here and we will continue continue We will meet Latvina, where is next one?
