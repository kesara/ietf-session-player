    "text": "the challenge that is making it hard to converge on solutions in the industry so I\u0027m just you know I think the corollary question almost could be is where does this live or does it need to live in more than one place or as if I\u0027m just gonna cause simply scheduling issues when it goes forward I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m gonna trust the mirror and Suresh to decide where it should live but whichever place we are we\u0027re probably going to want an adviser from the other area to work with us as well that actually makes sense okay great thank you I just they\u0027ve sent a crypto PBF liaison manager um so if the working group is formed I would ask that one of the first deliverables be a liaison out to the broadband forum to make sure that they understand that the work group got formed and what the scope is right that\u0027s the working group to that or test I\u0027m not just my process issue I\u0027m not sure who sends a liaison I could do it myself like personally in my experience it\u0027s a working group so if you want to do something before a working group is formed like I wanted me to send something saying like okay like IETF is considering working on there\u0027s like you know like you want to freak out or not right like that could be something we can do this stuff will go to new work right like as soon as there\u0027s a and they\u0027ll have the four weeks but but he\u0027s talking about something more specific I think and I mean I\u0027m happy to work with Charette Rogers officially come from whoever specific but just something that would note that the working group is either if you want to do it before it\u0027s formed that\u0027s fine just saying that this is under consideration if you\u0027d rather wait till after it\u0027s formed and have the work group chairs say here\u0027s the scope and charter and point to it that also works all I\u0027m trying to do get open communication as soon as it goes to isg review it will on or ib review the first step of the process there\u0027s a new work email that goes to all the other bodies that we send new work email to and I don\u0027t know if the BBF is one of them so I just want to like close the loop on this because I don\u0027t want to wait until like you know the chapter discussion happens right before like there we go because there\u0027s still if there\u0027s like stuff to be done in the Charter like that would decide whether like BBF would have issues with their website so I want to wait till this like one week period plus like three or four week period complete yes and if I have like working chat at the end of it like then I will like send this out before the anything is done yeah that\u0027s what I was saying that time that we send the work that\u0027s when it should go so they have the four weeks to come in before we make a charter it\u0027s not after there\u0027s a working group right I mean I\u0027m supporting you I think that\u0027s a good idea but I want to make sure your comments get in you know the Charter not that they\u0027re made to the working group after chartering no but Marga this like multiple phases right like so I\u0027m just suggesting sending this like right after we have something that is going for internal review in the idea because like the new work stuff goes out at external "

Montenegro so yeah I\u0027m wondering of how these things get deployed and there may be some policy you know about how to change what traffic gets banana pin which not and that there\u0027s all these implications you know so a lot of aggregation of traffic here and trust is you so are there a lot of operations maybe some mention of the Charter about making sure offs areas looking at this and aware okay and that\u0027s a good point and one thing that happens during the review is that like the obscene Eli Keisha Lee like freaks out a little bit and say like hey like how come you didn\u0027t think of the operational things and and they say like okay like where are the yang modules for this like where is the up like deployability considerations for this and that gets added like but but that\u0027s like done by design so like once we have an agreement inside a community like our community like the Venona community what needs to get done I think like the next steps needs to happen and I\u0027m pretty sure the the cities are gonna like talk about some stuff like maybe there\u0027s some privacy concerns we haven\u0027t thought about all that but I think that that will happen just by the process so and that\u0027s about it for me like does anybody have any questions on this like so what we\u0027re gonna do is we gonna like figure out like you know what the chatter is going to be and then decide like whether like you can go ahead I\u0027ll be quite honest I\u0027m not happy the way the discussions were sayin maybe it\u0027s just me but what I\u0027m not understanding is why new signaling protocol if the problem is you want to split traffic on two different links sure you know perfected load balancing you haven\u0027t specific proper mechanisms if you want a solid like a data plane layer it\u0027s fine but why new signaling protocol why do you want to you know define you know all the mobile infrastructure in the form of it just define a new protocol you\u0027ll end up with the exact same semantics control by control forestry yeah what you say makes sense right like just make that point I do understand right there is people who have concerns with this right like so that\u0027s what I\u0027m saying like we need to either it on the Charter like you know you raised a concern and I understand there\u0027s a concern so like you know let\u0027s make it I did on the list if you think it\u0027s not necessary like use an example like for example I would think you\u0027ll say FEMA can do this right and that\u0027s the thing it\u0027s fine like what you see with mine right see that debate should not be able to approach something else the question is let\u0027s evaluate this on the basis of merit right why a new protocol like don\u0027t say maybe I\u0027m Mike if you want to say something would you like it if we said in the Charter that for these items we will use existing ITF "
