And if you have any questions about IPR, then you should ask that's the URL. This is our note well. That tells more things about this. And in particular, Be nice to each other. Speak slowly. Kick me if I don't do that. And address the technical issues, not the people. Thanks.

Can you hear me? We can hear you. Perfect. So, yeah, as as we get said, this group was chartered in 2020. And because we have and we had the first buff in the spring of the 2020 during the first corona spring. And, so far, we've had, 4 with hackathons. We've done 9 virtual interims. And what we have ended up with is a specification, which is almost ready. For SDF. That's come through working group last call, and sort of dead Shepherd review done and so on. In addition, they're been a number of additional documents related to this created we can talk about the next page. And then sort of going ahead what we're aiming for next course depends on on the kind of recharter or Can we do this within the current charter discussion that we'll have at the end of this meeting?"

There are some agreed culture of people that I don't give no much about. That there are some building management people and so on. Home people And, these SDOs do environment. But the temperature sensor is is likely very similar between these different ecosystems. And it doesn't really make sense for different temperature sensors to use different data not because in the end, you want to the connect, integrate all this information. Into a common database and you you will want to work with things from multiple, ecosystem. Because, you won't get all the variety you need from a single ecosystem.

So an STF model essentially is a Jason document. Or multiple JSON documents that are linked together with JSON. Point. So we didn't reinvent the wheel there. An SDF specification or SDF model, can you reuse elements from other SDS specifications. So you don't have to write everything again.

Now the problem that we're seeing is that these IoT applications, they come siloed So applications come with their own network infrastructure, come with their own devices, right, and we're starting to see more and more of these silos, deployed in enterprise customers, even though that know, kind of the radios, radio technologies or the connectivity methods like, like, you know, for example, BLE or Wi Fi, are already deployed"

So the the problems we have to solve here are how do we onboard a device onto network infrastructure from an application How do we control that device? So and that's specifically important in, you know, non IP protocol. So protocols like, belly or Zigbee, for example. So how do we exchange data? With those devices. How do we connect to them? And then also the third one is how do we basically received telemetry from those those the devices. So that's basically, the the problem that we set out to to to solve. And, obviously, we wanted to solve that on a standard spaces. Because when an application, you know, comes to an enterprise network. We wanted to be able to have know, regardless of who the network provider is a set of APIs, at its disposal to integrate with that of of of network. So, the way we approach this is, We wanted to Builds I would say connectivity method or radio technology if it's wireless. Agnostic APIs that are kind of extensible based on, the connectivity method that the IoT device, uses. So, and and access agnostic gateway function with a application specific, sorry, or a radio, or a technology specific, controllers. And then we defined, 3 interfaces,"

So so that is moving forward, and that is applicable to IP and non IP devices. The the interface at question where we're talking about here is called Nipsey or non IP control. That now this is an API that, we built to allow applications to talk to non IP devices such as, Zigbee or BLE, for example. So what we did is we looked at those technologies and what we we really up, kind of up leveled to the API because in principle, the operations that they support are relatively similar. So, we ended up with a connectivity API which which which which basically allows us to, you know, bind to devices, connect, and disconnect from devices a data API, which allows us to exchange data with the the device and the registration So a registration API allows us to, register things in the network for the device, such as, for example, a a telemetry stream, then that telemetry stream can support, you know, device broadcasts. It can, support connected mode, streaming data, and things like connection state. Uh-uh and so forth. So we've, we've implemented, these APIs in at Cisco from an application perspective and also several application providers have done so. We're testing them in the field with customers.

Thank you very much. I wanna move on to the charter discussion. Okay. And we now have booked 15 minutes left from that, and I knew that we would eat of time, So so so so Thank you. Thank you. And let me see how do I turn this off. Do that. And 22. Yes. I wanted to share my screen And that's the one So if I did that right, you should all have our charter in front of you. I hope it's at a reasonable size. If you want me to make it I mean, I I I we can make it bigger and then scroll up and down. Remote people could, of course, just go to that website and and and do it. Do it. This is the job that's the charter. I know I was supposed to actually blow up to that point. Is my next this is the ground. And then the charter. Yeah. So Let's do that. And, There you go. That's much more useful, isn't it? So Effectively, We have done the first step of this. Okay. We have, worked with experts from 1 DM, and we've worked with seabornecddl, mailing lists, and the the re the formal methods is just isn't is I think not yet ready for our our our our our collaboration. We worked with T2g, and wishy Okay. And, so we pretty much done all those things."

So for since I believe, because I had a conversation earlier today, we believe, for instance, SDF location easily fits into that in SDF Relations and a couple of other related work, easily fits into that charter item already. We wouldn't need to re charter to do that. And Please go ahead, Carsten, and please get in the mic cue, any remote people as well. Yeah. I am in the vacuum. Yeah. Custom Bowman, I think the the the 2 submissions we have really interesting because the the open the the viewer a little bit the data model or the interaction model that we have, right now, focuses entirely on the digital side of things So the the from from the SDF point of view, the temperature sensors kind of disemodies and floats through space. And adding location to it, at some information about the physical site. And there may be other information about the physical site, Does this thing have a power connector or a US or a Chinese one. Whatever. These these are all physical descriptions we right now cannot do and Actually, the device does not need to know what of power connector it has. So, it it would not be something you would interact with the device about, you but, deck with a district about that. So that that's one interesting thing."

And the asset number and the budget where the money came from and and all this stuff. The the other, submission really is boat. Not just describing, things, but actually doing interactions with them. Which I think is just another dimension in which we can go the the data model tells us what what kinds of interactions we can expect to to make but we, right now, don't have, a way on the the IP layer to talk to non IP devices. So I think this would also work together quite well. And it also would work together with a mapping file. Proposal. That is all. Yeah. So to me, this this kind of all fits together together very well. So, to me, this would be the basis for defining a program for the next step of ASTF. We certainly don't want to boil the hole. Ocean, here, but we might pick specific points here. We're we're not going to to, asset budget things or something like that, but we probably should be doing things that, really are widely usable like location, location. Nicholas, go ahead. Right. Yeah. So I was just going to say that the, I I I I agree. I mean, both the current proposals are sending us in in potential, a very interesting, directions even though on my"

Because that's maybe more on the kind of doesn't tie us so much into a a specific way of solving things like like the non IP would do. But on the other hand, I'm also a bit worried that we are you know, that we have enough energy to finish things. We can we can discuss it at the but it's it's a bit of it's really good to have good use cases before we start doing things. And, we had a very good use case when we to the SDSDF work, and I think we should have the same kind of level of need, when we do things here. Yeah. I leave it to Elliot too. It's Nicholas. I propose that in the last three minutes we walk through the list of associated documents and kind of get a Yeah. Good point. Or a show of hands or something as to who actually would work on these documents. K. Elliot, go ahead. No. No. You you can we're we've got 90 minutes left. So lots of mic time left here. And then I'm gonna reserve discussion till we're at the end. Okay. So, I think we have a pretty compelling use case for non IP. The, and we're happy to take this into email. As well to to to articulated a bit more. The thing that I find really cool about this is that it allows for the SDF models to be applied to devices that are very, very small. And So we can we we can actually extend the the reach in terms of whether whether you you're looking at this from a meta standpoint, or a direct standpoint, through the through the JSON model.

Borrow, beg borrow and steal, we might not need to do any sort of transport work for IP. You can take borrow and steal there too. So so you're saying we could use an existing serialization as the central to gateway where it then becomes very Bluetooth specific or something. If it's possible, I think that should be looked at, but I I don't know that needs to be in the charter. I haven't thought about I haven't thought that through I'm just thinking, let's let's apply the the generic engineering principles of beg borrow and steal for your build before you build Cool. Okay. Do do you do you can you propose any text that would make clear that Nipsey was in context at this point, because at this point, I think it's kinda slippery neither here nor there's Francesca in our room she remote. Yeah. Oh, she's there. Yeah. I I can. In fact, we talked about this on the interim, but I need piece of information from you. You had asked for, PRs. Yes. Didn't know where to deliver Yeah. That's my fault for not actually, posting a 8 a revised charter, in time. So So, yes. So I'm sorry about that. I I do think that a the value of the the non IP work in particular is that it gives you the reach for for modeling all the way through the device. An an IP you you use the IP infrastructure to manage non IP devices using models. So That's the short version. So not so I I don't know. I'm list trying to look around the groom and trying to judge people's faces, but I'm actually wearing their own glasses. So I draw kind of blurry.

Please just go to the mic or or put your name in the queue and because I can remove Elliot from the QVM move. So Hey, Alexander Pelleth. So, you very much. I I find I'm I'm just going to to give a a couple of thoughts on the, Nipsey proposal. So, it seems to me that there is, a problem to be solved there. I'm not sharing the way it should be approached you know, but it's it's there's something to be solved or Zigbee Gilly. Laura and Laura Wanda is a is a use case and, there have been actually some work at the LoRa Alliance in that, in the error for defining this kind of APIs internally. But I I I I I I think that there is, you know, a need at least to to start poking the direction. I cannot say if this is the right group, but I I say that I find interest in in that. And what I would really love also to see is if we also have like, consideration of not only having the HTTP and MPTT bindings, but maybe if we have like, allocate, like, bring some, if you have, like, non IP devices that can be brought the IP world for example, with Chic, then, you know, you can really have this kind of a very smooth transition between the two worlds. Right? But there is definitely at least for me, this, feeling of ASDF, what ASDF is doing in terms of you know, bridging the gaps, like, unifying a model semantic unifying different working different NGOs. And and the way to manage this, like, to to do this connectivity part. I'm even thinking about, okay, why rest for API? Why not do it with an SDF description? Like, have an SF description of the gateway and"

But I I think there are something, and I'll really like to see it, like, more with more details. Yeah. Aude, I mean. I think it would be very useful for us to kind of continue to flesh out how this fit together. I understand now much more than I did for the weekend, so thanks a lot for all the interactions here. How how I see them too is that they're kinda solving same problem but in different levels. Where Nipsey is kinda unifying access, like, the low level access to the data SDF is unifying what the data means. Of course, in, in the end, we need both parts, and I think that's gonna clear connection here, but actually very, very little overlap at the moment. So I wouldn't say it's an STF serialization, I mean, it's more like you could get this date up. You can then deal with STF what the data means. Definitely, you do need the unified access and the SDF as of today's, doing nothing for that. It's only describing what it actually means once you have the data. So clearly, I mean, these two things fit nicely together, let's, you know, figure out, I mean, logistically where to do it. And and, of course, unification were probably on the APIs would be friendly towards each technology. That kind of things make a lot of sense to at least coordinate know, it's all done in the same group, then would, of course, happen very naturally. Ari, I have a question for you. When we chartered ASDF, one of my understandings was that one of the reasons why we were staying at semantic level was essentially to stay out of other people's spaces they had the transferred. They had all that stuff. And they have their own gateway. And that ASTF Oh, our SDF was sim simply going to allow them to more mechanically translate between things.

And so we really were never ever messing with anyone We were just becoming the u UN of of of of of models rather than, you know, specific industry true. We we have been playing it safe, on on on the SD. Yeah. So so so So what you're describing, because you are one of the bridging proposals, does this feel like a chain a large change to you? In direction. So I'm not yet sure. I think, I think, like, I understand now better. How these things could fit together. I don't yet have a strong opinion how to do it. And I think like, going forward with the understanding, doing whiteboarding and, you know, a bit more specific on my how this is fit together, think that will actually increase our understanding on how we should do it. K. I wouldn't jump to conclusion right now. David I think you're gonna get the last word here before I wanna jump through these documents, documents, lot of questions. Thank you. Basically my concern about, and IPC were addressed by to form a person's and about the the the charter I will, also answered to to your question to Ari. By saying that in my view, the SDF is defining but that's a model and the way to represent that data model. And the interaction with the various SDOs if done through future mapping, files. But, yet to be defined this is the way I understand and the way I am using SDF. So people may have different views. Maybe I'm totally won't go on this.

Absolutely. Alright. So, I have, like, 30 seconds. I wanna walk through this couple documents and you know, wave or please wait. Put your hands up, I guess. And I'm sorry for remote people. I don't have a wait. I'm I don't have a a a humming thing for you to do. So you could actually put in the chat you know, just type the document name that you would agree to review. So who would review on work on SDF Compact 3, 4 people. K? Digital twin, 5 five people. Digital twin, Looks like the same five people. Sorry. Nipsey. Oh, quite a few. Like, more than I can easily quickly count. Okay. Extended relation information for Smith to definition language. Sorry, but isn't that your document? No. That SDF type link. And we have 3 or 4. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, given the act the the the things, I think we have probably enough energy that, you know, we could get through many of these documents, but we might wanna spend we might wanna think carefully about what order we do them in.
