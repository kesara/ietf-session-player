So we are extending the use of multi part, to other TLVs where it has not been explicitly specified in the relevant RFCs. There are already, implementations that have are using this for neighbor and prefix DLVs. And we've learned, of course, that partial deployment is very problematic. So the other motivation for this draft is, you know, to make sure that everybody understands this is the solution of choice. The draft was first published in January of 2022. Got a lot of lively discussion, over the almost 2 years, and it was finally adopted, in December. Since December, we published one update with a couple of Minor changes, So the changes that we put in, we have examples in there, of how to use a key to identify that 2 different TLVs are actually talking about the same object.

We think this is not appropriate for an IETF standard to document, to to to mandate must behavior for what's essentially local configuration options. But his point is well taken because partial deployment, particularly of TLVs that are so widely used is neighbor and prefixes is very problematic. So we added a paragraph to try to emphasize the importance of, an implementation providing these controls. Alright. Next steps, we The authors have no, plans for any further changes.

And, as we know, the total packet header chain size is increasing in SIV6. So for the header notes, we have Iom, data fields can be in hope by hope or destination option header. And, it is similar for alternate marking. And for network slide network slicing, you can have, an IP option in hope by header. And for SF service programming, metadata can be carried in as/terv. And the inter for the inter intermediate nodes, and and address some binding set. So a new set can be encapsulated to the original packet. And for T OFA, a repair list can be kept by PRR. So, and we can see there are still on ongoing individual works, wants to carry the data along the SOE 6 packets, whether it's in the hope by hope or header or SFTRVs.

So with this mechanism, and maybe you can choose to sending detection messages and, received the error message, So you can know what's the limit. And, but it may work well when there's a large number of parts because the burden of sending the burden of sending and receiving S and P messages increases. And if the past ending SR, the past may be dynamic. So The segment list may change over time. So it makes it more difficult to collect the limits in advance. And so we think IGB signaling maybe an feasible solution. The first point is, the head add and intermediate note easily get to the aggregate header limits of all the nodes in the domain.

This is v 6 ipv6 extension headers that we are dealing with. And depending on the header type and role of the node. There are different headers types of headers that the node would have to pass.

There is also some 6 man work already working group extension header limits. There is a draft So I would suggest to, kind of refine this problem in 6 man working group.

So all the nodes can calculate the routing table ahead of the Skype pipe. And, as we know that, when we advertise the schedule time, we didn't at work has them periodically.

So, like, like, coloring, basically, like, one physical layer 3 link, like, a big bundle with many member links and then being able to have multiple colors on a single member link. I I I mean, on a single bundle, I guess. Is that the concept, I guess, that you're trying to achieve yeah. I think, yeah, you're right. We we need to have a per bundle member link, color, and, on the layer 3 linkage, we be the union of all the, colors of the members that we can have the phone number. I see. So, like, each, like, individual number links could actually associate a different color for the individual member links. Right. Right. Color is the user to correlate the control control plan and the resource in the then interface. Crust crust Right. Understood. So you you know, like, this the same concept of Sense."

    "text": "I think with, Like, in in, with with SRMPLS, I think it is a little bit difficult to actually let's say if you have one physical layer 3 link, you can't actually break out the NRPs and maybe a little bit more called, let's say, to do queuing. You know, like, you you can't do H EOS on MPLS and you And if you wanna do, queuing, like, it could have some differential queuing on the different, Let's say, you know, colors within a m within a bundle may be difficult. But let's say with that seventy 6, I think especially, I think if you have, Yeah. Serv SRV 6. Let's say with microsid, I guess, with with where you end up having multiple, you have multi a different low cater per elbow. You don't have a match on an algo, so you can like, really discrete queuing characteristics, and so you could possibly carry most full colors, j without doing anything else, you could do it with an SR 6, but SRMPLS, it is definitely quite difficult. There's any way to do that. And that's, like, probably independent of having a, a member, you know, having, a bundle. It could be just a regular layer 3 lane you could actually have multiple link colors on a single physical link but with s rnpls, That isn't really possible of of doing that, but but now applying that same concept to, what you're trying to do I think if you're really trying to do the coloring, I mean, I mean, I see the point if you have, let's say, a big fat pipe but you don't wanna have separate l threes you wanna have a big fight pipe with many, many member links, but now you want to have different SLA characteristics per, like, NRP, different characteristics for each, each color. Then, I mean, I could see that that being a use case possibly of having a big bundle, a big bundle,"

Thank you. We can continue discussion. Okay. Thank you everyone for the good discussion. Please continue on the list. So for this time, we did allocate, 15 minutes discussion buffer. I guess it's serverless for us. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. We'll go to the next one. I think we have one last is nigga Good afternoon, everyone. This is Jedong. I'm going to present this document IGP flash algo with link loss. On behalf of the call, sir. Yeah. Okay. Here, the contents of this presentation, we will give an introduction about the motivation and the solution. Then we will talk about the the comments received and the discussion. On the list. And then we will give the next steps about some missed documents. Okay. The motivation is, we know that link loss is a important, performance metric that can directly impact the service performance and, it is necessary necessary to avoid using links, which have a high packet loss rate. The link loss rate, can be advertised using existing, IGP protocol extensions like, the unidirectional link loss of TLV defining the existing Fc for isis and the SPF. And, here,"

I just had everything reset, but there was they're supposed to have been doing maintenance on my cable link, so I just assumed that was going on. But it looks like maybe it was a meet echo wide reset. Yeah. I mean, I I can hear I can hear you guys, but I can't hear anything else. Yeah. Yeah. I also see that we are being transcripted. Transcribed I'm not very useful. No. No. The classic number where in room? the Yeah. I don't know. No. But she's not responding. Right? Maybe that we lost the room. That could be it. Network partition. Now Alright. The chat seems to be capturing it. Oh, yeah."

We got, both audio and video from the room. Okay. You can hear us now. Right? Yes. Okay. Do I need to, repeat? Oh, we're repeat whatever you think is necessary. So so so maybe we can briefly repeat what I just that. Start from page. Okay. Okay. So we know that the link loss rate is, important magic And for This is already We've already heard this. You sentence changed in your only one have document. To last presentation. Right? Yeah. So this is a brief introduction about the mechanism defined here. We use, a new, FAD metric constrained Hi. Constraint. Of TLV to specify the threshold of the lien class rate so that when but the leak loss rate of a link, is, higher than this, threshold listing will be excluded from the calculation of the past. Okay. Yeah. The extension to"

    "text": "this is a subdirectory format. And is a in the FAD, TLE, I'm here. Yeah. So here we can take a look at the comments and discussions on the list. First is, where are the source of the ceiling class information? Actually, was seeing this, for IGP, we already have this, some TOV, defined in the RBC 7471 and RTC FC, 8570 70. To carry this unidirectionally class rate. In the IGP protocols. And, for flight cycle, actually, the link loss rates should you carry the in the, sub TLV is defined in sees 9470 9. And, obviously, 91st 92. Because we are using this, specific, application specific, lene catrepews, in the flight circle. As for the measurement of the link loss rate, we can use existing IETF Technologies such as, TUM and, stamp but for each specific operator, they can choose the measurement method depends on their medical policy are there available device, equipments or the Mass messers. Okay. And the second, comments is about how can we surprise the frequent advertisement of the link, status if the link loss rate change frequently. So we think there's, yeah, there may be some cases, packet loss rates can in your frequently, around the threshold of this, so rational value so that, we need to consider to introduce some timers to in the device, to control that to delay some a surprise. There's a advertisement of this kind of the leak loss rate change. Yeah."

And and We just we have addressed all the comments received so far, and we will Welcome for the review and the feedback. Collaboration on this. In the other way, it's income since this is straightforward, within the weekend. Ask for working group adoption if there's no further comments. Yeah. Comments, k. AC, please go ahead. You are the first one? Hello? Can you hear us? AC, please go ahead. muted. I muted when I was unmuting. I Okay. Just to switch it up. Yeah. I think I think the last the first time you presented this. People got hung up on how the link lost. Was calculated And as you noted, we already have this metric. In the IGP's as a te metric. Right? This link lost. And it's been defined in there was a lot of discussion then. And I think all that's needed maybe, yeah, I mean, this isn't necessarily for adoption is some operational guidance. With Ying Zen and Chris and I had talked about the that you'd wanna use the same you know, the same mechanism across the domain when you're doing this. For the flex algorithm. Yeah. link loss. Have something, you know, Or the a similar method. You wouldn't wanna do it one way. But, I mean, that seems kinda obvious, but probably the draft should should say that. But I think, yeah, I I don't speaking as working with member, given the other constraints we have, I don't see why we wouldn't use link loss. As a flex algorithm constraint as well."

    "text": "Yeah. Thanks for the comment. I think we will add some description description about the That's a good guideline for us. Just just add clear statement. a Yeah. Okay. In the next version. Okay. Any more questions? Since this is the last presentation of this session, and You're there. Okay. If no more questions, I think we are done with other presentations. Anybody want to say since we still have 8 minutes left. Anybody want to say anything. Yeah. Please Yeah. Gunther, routing AD. So It's gonna be my first statement here, you know, when the, link state routing working grip. So Yeah. Wonderful. So I just want to reiterate again what Tony Lee actually mentioned is that, you know, the the the lead state routing protocol do not like dump trucks for all sorts of information to put in there. It is really the, you know, the the underlay foundation for all communication if it tumbles over. Everything running on top of it tumbles over it also. So that's a big big drama. Now what I'm seeing, you know, for quite a while now already, we start to put more and more stuff into the, you know, into the link state databases, which is not always used for computing a best part through the network. We put a lot of, you know, we start to put, like, lots of metadata lots of other things and someone in there. And, you know, even though it could be like seen as a very easy, like API for getting, you know, stuff across the network, it does come at a cost step because you have to send these things, you know, back and forward. You have to check, you know, check the validation of that. You have to decode it. Have to take care, you know, how how, you know,"

So So So that that is probably going to be one of my focuses for the next, you know, 2 years, you know, unless and is still you know, if there's like any other way of conveying some of the information, no, no, would like to keep it out of the link state database itself, And if we still have to put it in there, there may be some valid reasons. That, you know, I do wanna be convinced, you know, that actually the IGP is the best way for doing that. So, That is, you know, something I would like to share with, with the working group here. So, so, so, so, so, If you have any comments, please let me know. You know, where to find me. Okay. Any for the Okay. If not, I think we are done with this session. Thank you everybody for attending and the good discussions. And we'll see you in Vancore. Bye, everybody. CMN Cooper."
