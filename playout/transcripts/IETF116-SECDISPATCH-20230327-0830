So there's been some discussion over the last couple days on the on the sector dispatch about the clear text email copies draft that I wrote. This slide deck is a lot of suspense here. Next slide, please. So the picture that's on this next there you go. Is the scenario that that that the draft tries address. So the person on the right hand there, up with the blue, has crypto material for themselves and also to be able to sign a message and also they'd have could have a for the person the lower. Right? Who's wearing green, But they don't send an encrypted copy to the person in red. So they're sending one message and saying it to two recipients,"

And it causes a lot of weird downstream paper cuts in the end to end encrypted of email user experience. So next slide, please. The problem statement here, the the the kinds of paper cuts that we see is you receive a message, your mail agent wants to render it and tell you What is the crypto status of this message? Was it encrypted? And you don't really know. Because you don't know where the a clear text copy was also sent. And when you hit reply all, A good user agent won't leak the content. Of your encrypted message. To in in the reply. And so if you hit reply all, and you don't have a key for the other recipient, maybe they don't have a key because maybe they are a mailing list. Perhaps they're a meaningless like the It mailing list, which is archived on the public Internet. So there is no encryption key for it. So when you hit reply all, you can't encrypt your reply. And a reasonable agent that cares about end to end grip encryption, will refuse to provide... Refuse to send the message because it can't send it encrypted in your you know, you've got quoted and attributed clear tax content. In it. So that's the sort of thing where the recipient hits reply all in the usual workflow. And then all of a sudden their says, no. I won't let you and they say why? This encryption thing. This is the pits. I'm gonna turn it all off. And one of the many reasons why we just don't have encrypted the email. Next slide So the question is, can we signal as a sender that we are sending clear text copies. Or that we have not sent Clear text copies"

    "startTime": "00:06:01",
    "text": "so that the recipient can handle it in a more reasonable way. If if we could signal it, maybe we could do something smarter the agents all understood what to do. The baseline question is If we're gonna signal such thing, where would we signal? I think the answer for that is a email header that ends up on the inside of the crypto graphic envelope. The message. But I could be convinced otherwise. I believe there's an open question about do we signal in detail like, sent an encrypted copy to these recipients and not to those recipients. Or did we just say, I send and encrypted the copy to all recipients versus Somebody got a a clear text copy. And the third question is what guidance should we give the recipients how they should behave when they get a message that that either Clear copy was made or or is ind? How do we advise recipients to behave sen. Like, do you show the user that message was encrypted, but it has a little question mark over the lock or I don't think we wanna get in this draft into the specifics of, like, concrete user interface design, but we should be thinking about how should we represent the crypto status. So that is the problem statement of this this piece. There's already been some discussion that I think it's been clarifying on the list, so thank you to the folks participated in that discussion. I'm asking the basic dispatch questions. Where should this land if it lands at the? Or should somehow this just say don't ever do this and we'll come and beat you up if your familiar agent does it. But if we even if we say that, how do we say that from within the? Get people to take it seriously. Any suggestions for where to dispatch such a thing. Jim?

I'm not I'm not I I I've I've only just kind of scanned the the graph, but I'm I'm not quite sure what the interoperability aspects of this are. And but there was not exactly the same, but kind of a a little bit of an analogous feature that I proposed a few years ago that was done through the Ut working group. Mh. This is not a Trs sort of thing. But I mean in there there some some similarities it there. In that case, we're mostly dealing with security on the wire in this case, it's more security rest that you're that you're concerned but... Right. So those are good questions. So I do think this is an interoperability issue. Because the this... I sort of beat my head against this for a few months before I thought of just writing up draft. But what happens is one person's tooling makes decision x, and it causes a failure in another person's tooling. Right? That's the scenario that we're seeing. Somebody sends a clear text copy, and then somebody else can no longer reply all in the safe way. Right? And those two decisions don't work if the other... If the two sides don't know that they're doing it. So there's needs to be some sort of communication between two millions of agents distinguish it. So that's the inter bit. I agree with you that it's not the same as your required Tls. Thing because of because it's end to end crypto and not messaging to the transport. So because we're trying to message to the other side, I think it needs to happen on the inside of whatever Crypto got envelope is is is being passed there.

I feel like if if you were back here, right, that would be your your answer to your own draft. I'm a little little... How would be my answer? That you shouldn't dispatch. This is not, you know, something that we should do. But because I think the the the problem is a lot more complex than even just this. There's also encrypted transports for Sm p of which, you know, with Dana and other things which I'm an author of. There's a lot of a lot more pieces in this. So if we are gonna dispatch it, I would say, it's a big enough problem that it probably needs to be a working group. So this doesn't intend to cover anything, but end to end encrypted email messages. So transport encryption out, thinking from a big picture architecture, how do we do this for the end user, which is really what you're trying to do Right? Yes. It it it will begin with maybe day end user to end user. I mean, you're talking about something that shouldn't be done in the first And maybe that's the right thing to do. Is write a draft saying, don't do this. Right. But how do I get So so my that was my initial inclination. Right? This... Like, can we hit the folks for doing it and say, don't do it. But I've talked to some folks who do it. Who's no to do it, and they say, well, I'm doing this because I more encrypted copies is better than fewer encrypted copy or something... Arguments like that. I don't necessarily buy those, but I don't think I can just convince people by saying don't do it. What I wanna do is I wanna say we have a signal you're not allowed to put in your message according to the standard of what this message says.

I think. That's the hope. But I think we need a a mechanism that male can agree on to do it. This is Pete Res. There's a bunch of questions I have here which are whether most of this is a user agent function rather than protocol. I I think you've at least acknowledge that there are a bunch of those issues, but there might still be protocol for interoperability purposes on top. Yep. And I'm not sure you've comb them all out. Don't know that this eventually needs a working group but it might do well with a non working group forming even if it's online only because I think you want a bunch of email people in the room along with some security people to sort of come out which are just Ua issues that someone's gonna have to figure out what the buttons look like and which are the pieces of information we need to transfer between them. I mean, my ideal for this is that the protocol mechanism lets you say there's no bodies. That the that the mail user agent behavior is not something that we're asking the user to do. Right? But the mail today can't do it because it doesn't know. So the the thing that got me started trying to sort this was I thought I know that there's going to be a male use agent who says okay, I've got an encrypted message that this person's going to reply to and insists on replying in the clear because they're an idiot. Okay? Even if it was never sent in the clear beforehand, they're going to do exactly the wrong thing. Sure."

So I... I'm I'm thinking that there are more instances of those kinds of what is really just the user interaction with this stupid program issue and what is something that we actually wanna communicate that's worth communicating?

The the goal of this draft is not to encourage people to do this more. It's it's to say, if you're gonna do this, you need... You you should mark your messages in the following way. And if you aren't gonna do this, you can mark your messages in this other way. And then recipients can deal with that the way that they see fit. Because the recipients are the ones that pay the cost. Right? Because they can't reply all smoothly. They see the message. It looks like it was in but actually, it was published on the Internet in a mailing archive or whatever. Right? So the goal is I'm sending... I'm... By putting this signal in my message, I'm gonna commit to my choice. And then the people who receive the message can then respond to it in in ways that makes sense for them. Without without breaking as much. So the signal is I am behaving badly.

So what what is the possible problem with this? Primarily threats do to privacy or possibly do a modification of these this additional information. So the privacy It would be if this... You're getting surreal somehow on the link. And this information could make it much easier to tell more about the source of the packet. Instead of this maybe Ip address you might have additional information which would reveal the actual host or even the process on the host or something or person or whatever. And you in as well as fine more fine rate identity the source, you might also have aggregate source in information it might reveal that a bunch of flows are really coming from the same organization.

You can do hot or edge edge, hop texas against.

There will be some information available to somebody who can your traffic like the number of size of packets.

Okay. Okay. I have a document updating some portion of x five nine. Next slide. Yeah. Why stick to easy things? Next slide. So in next five nine, there's this feature called policy validation and it's made up of actually like a bunch of extensions, but the main two are there's the certificate policies extension, which give you a list of policies which are that are asserted by the certificate, so this would be if, like, I C issues some blue certificates and some red certificates and the red certificates are like more validated or something. And then when they show up in intermediates, then they"

    "text": "access constraints. So as an Rp, you like, intersect them up the chain, and that's all reasonable. Then there's policy mapping. So what policy mapping does is... Suppose I'm a c and I issue rent certificate and I would like to delegate to this other organization, but the thing that I call red They call Crimson. Rather than us agreeing on the names of the colors, I just renamed the oi. So I can issue across certificate this other organization and say, If they say Crimson, please treat it as if I said red. And then you just get to list arbitrarily many of these, like tu, then the Rp needs to somehow make sense of it. Then there's a whole bunch of other features that all intersect with this that I will spare you the trouble of going through. But if you read all the bits of policy validation, it's loads of on. Next slide. And david you can look at here. Oh. Yep. Much more convenient. Okay. So how does the Rp make sense of this? So follow Fifty two eighty, it says you build a policy tree. A policy tree, is a tree where there's one level for each certificate in the chain. And then each node corresponds to a policy that is asserted by that certificate. And then the edges are mapping between them. So in this example if we have an intermediate with policy one two, and five and then those mapping and your entity has two three six then three matches to one by way of mapping, two is on maps it shows up on its own. Five and six don't match anything. So your final policies are one and two an authority space or three and two in subject space, but nobody uses this. Next slide. Alright. And when you look over there. So in order to build this, you just follow this very simple algorithm. It's it's it's fine. Next slide. Oh, I... Okay. It's didn't all fit. Sorry. So yeah, the the point is that, like, because that thing is so complicated. Everyone just transcribe the algorithm directly into their back And there's this one bit here. For each policy and the certificate, And for each note in the previous level,"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:42:01",
    "text": "that matches this policy create a child note. So I said that each node corresponds to a policy, but they're not one to one. One policy can cause multiple notes to happen. And then because there's multiple nodes in this steps, then that means that then for the next step, there'll be more matches and so at every level you get get more and more notes. Next slide. I'm sorry. Alright. Yeah. Which means that x five nine certificate validation is an exponential space operation It's great. So if you have a certificate, the policy is one and two, and mapping of all pairs one two to one two. So this is just four... Sorry. Six entries, then you repeat this down your chain at every level your policy tree doubles in size And I have had loads of fun knocking out the certain verification daemon on my stuff until I got the vendor to fix it. Next slide. So this is an hall service vulnerability. In most cases, you have to be a C exploit, which is partially a mitigation, but if you're a hosting provider, you may evaluate an un Pk on behalf of your customer, even if you do trust your P I, x five nine is all about delegation. So trusted C may just issue a constrain intermediate to someone who is otherwise un trusted, and unless they remember to set the inhibit policy mapping constraint, which they probably didn't then that subs c can go do this. Next slide. So how do you fix this? Actually, the fix is really simple. Rs fifty two eighty just specified the wrong algorithm every time R fifty two eighty says to make two nodes, we should have just made one node with two pairs. Means it's not a tree. This is a dag. This reason this works out is that if you like, run through that mess of text. Every copy of a note is identical down the bottom, you shouldn't have made two copies in the first place. Next slide. And if you do that, then policy graphs now grow linearly and everything is great. Next slide."

    "text": "So that's all this document does. It updates fifty two eighty to the new algorithm. There is much more text than that small example I suggested because I had to up say all over the text to, like, refer to this new structure and also update all examples to be more, But but length comes from the original document. I didn't just like make this more longer for the sake bit. It does have to update the output of the process because fifty two eighty says the output is the tree, which means that this exponential space structure is actually in your public Api. And that's no good. So it instead uses the formulation that's in the It x and I document where you just get the list of policies and their qualifier and that one is like a much more manageable thing. And then if you can't get away with this, because you followed fifty two eighties, original output public Api. The document also discusses other mitigation. You can limit the certificate depths you could just stop once you see too many nodes, that's what Open cell has done in their most recent security advisory. You could just turn off this feature altogether if you don't need it, that would be great. And if you verify signatures first, then at least only tries see can attack you. And ...okay. Yeah. Any questions? Should this go? Okay. Thanks, David. Stephen. Hi, Same. I have a question and then I guess across answer. The request is why go to the trouble of anything other than getting rid of all this crap. I I would not disagree. Okay. So I... I'm... In the Web I, E such because use this. I don't think they use mapping. So you could probably just turn off policy mapping I believe the Fed d loves to use this feature, but I don't know offhand hand. And... But I guess the like, other answers, like, if you previously implemented it, it is a compatibility, Break to drop this feature and so, like, you made like, like, The document... One of them in the mitigation do amount to"

So if the if the outcome was people not to do and not telling him how to do it, and be happy that this was dispatched standing her and custom. If if yeah if the outcome was more towards... Here's another way of doing something that nobody wants to do. I probably but prefer that it it was, you know, we just ignore the problem. Sorry. What was the first one? Say again? So if the plan is to tell people just never do this and rip repo that code. Then I'm happy to that this gets dispatched anywhere and gets done. If the plan is to say here's yet another way to do something that nobody wants to do. I I'd rather just ignore the problem. K. Sean. Hey. So I guess I'm gonna see the opposite I'm wildly supportive if you're doing this. I think it should just go to Lamps because that's where it is. If you wanna swap out the algorithm and say, you can keep doing it this other crazy way if you want, here's maybe another way to do it more efficiently, you know, make your choice. I think that's perfectly okay. I will note it at one point long ago. I tried to get new examples for how to make identifier included in the fifty two eighty and got kicked in the teeth. So whatever happens, but if you're gonna make life better for the people who do use policy mapping please, let's document you a minute. And I think you might have experience with that. So thanks for doing all the work. Yeah. We've implemented this in cell and Chromium and algorithm works fine. That we jump bother with policy qualifier. Jonathan. Jonathan Holdings should be or a correct dispatch option will be just provide good libraries and people who use them. Okay? Dk?"

Oh yeah. Ma'am. And this is a mess. And One more question. Do you know anyone who actually uses policy mapping? I I think the Fed kai does, but I can't say authoritative. I've just been like told from colleagues who like used to do this stuff. So you've never seen them. And rust Mode, yes. Just for the record. Depth that we can here you Power... Yes. Indeed Fed uses it. P uses it, do you Dp uses it? They love it. It's terrible. John. Yeah it's I'm just gonna say I I've implemented as well and used it. For fifteen years and yes. I run into you know? Exponential things with this. So this is a great enhancement to this. And... Yeah. So I would support putting this into the lamb working group because that makes sense. That's where all the X five and nine stuff is Okay. Mike. Mike Ellsworth. This is actually a question for Deb. I think, are you gonna endorse this draft? Like as a is there a Pk that wants to do this rather than a ver? As I said on the did listening today? So it does matter. Okay. Roman, you're you're standing there. Yeah.

I'm sorry, at least gonna bring the document and have a conversation about what the next step would be and that those can be a range of different steps. So I think kind of Lamps and.

As you know, Trying the mobile has many almost hundred.

I I don't understand. What Sorry for confused you because I I just you got sick to secure routing as the topic and when I guess some comments from their expert the they have the suggestion for that. It is more accurate for security functions capabilities exposure but I update the slides just before the moment. So it's owning the old slice. So is there something to dispatch? No. at the stage.

So is the program of the topic? That I use. So most of us feels that it's the sensing about a routine. Right. So sorry for that, we will modify modify it. Okay. Thank you, A. Thank you.
