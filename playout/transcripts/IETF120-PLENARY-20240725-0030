I don't know whether everyone liked the remedial homework they probably got at the airport on Friday and Saturday, as they were probably assigned, I'm sure that's what you were doing is you were waiting around for your flight to come reading a lot of internet drafts, and I'm hoping that resulted in lots of great productivity in the working group kind of sessions but kind of in all seriousness you know thanks for everyone for making the extra effort to me to come here i know the logistics were"

Please only unmute your mic to be recognized in the queue If you are in the queue speaking, don't hesitate to turn on your video experience from prior meetings this week and in general kind of with Meetecho headsets are going to be your kind of friends here. So if you have that, that's going to make for a better experience for us in you in all likelihood We have largely a standing agenda that we're going to execute kind of here tonight we're going to go through the host presentation. We're going to have the various leadership bodies to give you reports. We're going to have the NOMCOM talk to you. We'll have the trust we'll have the rfc editor we'll have the administrative LLC report, and then we'll bring back the various leadership bodies for open mics to feed you comments and feedback But before we kind of get any further, I wanted to kind of stop and kind of pause and remind everyone the magic that happens this week, the success of this meeting, and what lets us talk about all these various technical topics is due to the physical facilitation of those different organizations and the team that you see here. The magic happens because of the secretariat me echo, the knock, the LLC, the tools Team, and the Hackathon kind of support that really started for us on kind of on Saturday. So I want to give them a round of applause for, and a big kudos for making the magic happen for us Okay, so next up, it's my pleasure to introduce Jiuya Wu, who's going to be giving us a recorded presentation"

So here are the stats that we often prepare in preparation for kind of meetings. The top line things. I wanted to go over. The participation can previously heard is the IESG coming up to the mic line. So here are the stats that we often prepare in preparation for kind of meetings. The top line things I wanted to go over. The participation count, the distribution by country looks roughly what we saw at our last North American meeting at IETF 117 in San Francisco We'll talk a little bit about the proportion of on-site and remote, but again that looks like the profile we last time saw in North America I wanted to call out two particular things. We handed out the most on-site fee waivers I'm sorry, we had the most on-site fee waiver requests than we've had since I believe we started handing them out post-COVID The IETF chair gets 10. We got 25 requests The prior high water mark was 17 or 18. The average is around kind of 17. So there were quite a few requests and we handed out all the ones that we were able to do. We also had tremendous protection in the hackathon and you know I just wanted to highlight we all had a lot of remote participation in addition to the on on-site participation at the hackathon Talking about distribution between on-site and remote again these are within the bounds that we saw at IETF 117 in San Francisco, both on, kind of raw count and across countries And then the last kind of demographic count is a comparison to the longer retrospect back to kind of 114 showing you the fraction of on-site remote. And we're largely seeing the continued kind of trend that remote will be somewhere in the at the low end, on the high 30 kind of percentages surging up to maybe half the participants and we're within within that within that balance here again at this meeting and kind of top line number we're not close to the high water that we of course had in Prague but it is a well-attended kind of meeting in comparison to some of that"

And talking kind of with Jay, you could have this morning there is a long-term kind of plan to continue to sustain this kind of in the future all feedback of course is welcome based on how that potentially went for your child Okay, to roll up some of the stats about what the IESG has been working on, we may three different kind of announcements. I'm going to talk a little bit more about them two around posting rights action, one around a community survey. We had zero appeals since we last saw you in 119 in person and then here are a bunch of pointers where you can get additional reports on some details about what the IESG is doing. Now moving into current events, we need your help So the IESG needs your feedback on how to plan IETF 125 If you have attended a meeting since IETF, uh, you got a survey from the email address of QEmailserver.com with the title Qualtrick Survey, ITS survey on IETF 125 venue, with an individualized link to provide us feedback on that meeting.

Search your email, and please respond to this survey to reiterate the port the importance of this the IETF LLC is an charge of doing venue selection. They have identified a candidate venue, several candidate venues in China for IETF 125, which is March 2025 Community feedback arrived based on that process of doing venue selection and identity and they asked the IESG to confirm that this, the meeting venue would meet the, requirements of why we meet as the IT they asked the IESG to confirm that this, the meeting venue would meet the requirements of why we meet as the IETF. And the IESG decided we can only do that through community feedback. So that is why we launched the survey. We purposely launched it in early July, and we're purposely ended on Saturday so we can drum up as much feedback as we possibly can. So I'm quite kind of serious if you have not felt that We purposely launched it in early July and we're purposely ending on Saturday so we can drum up as much feedback as we possibly can. So I'm quite kind of serious if you have not filled out that survey, please flip open a device, find it in your mailbox and and kind of give us word because the survey will close on Saturday. And the IESG is going to deliberate and deliver a message of which way we're going with that meeting to the LLC, ideally by Earth September the other area of kind of current events, if you've been on some major IETF mailing lists, some of the plenary lists, you have probably noticed in the last seven or eight weeks that there is a lot of interest and a lot of discussion around what the future of moderation, what moderation looks like in the IETF and what the moderation should be in the in the We have observed several drafts coming from the community, which is fabulous on perhaps how we could do it better. In our assessment is the IESG this is a complicated and nuanced topic, and to get a durable solution for the community, which we feel we need, the answer is a working group. One of those drafts went to dispatch on Monday, and it appeared that the community confirmed that a working group is the best way forward So I would invite the community. Please go on to Mod Discuss at IETF, sign up for that mailing list, and if this is a topic, that you are passionate about you're interested in about or have"

    "text": "feedback on, please provide that to the mailing list And that's the place where you can track next steps on that activity. Switching gears a little bit, prior to being chair, I was on the I-ist for a couple of years, and observing common questions that came up to the mic line, I wanted to prepare a few kind of slides into comments that often kind of come up in the mic line and give you a sense of where the IESG is making some progress in response to your community feedback One of those items of feedback that we've heard in kind of recent years is that the community desires more diversity and more fresh input into the leadership pool. That's observed across those that you see on the IESG and realizing that for in almost in almost all cases the stepping stone to be in AD is through the path of being a working group chair And there's a desire for the community to see new folks being appointed as as working group kind of chair The IESG has historically kind of said two things First, if you are, if you would like to change the composition of the IESG, now is a great time for that Dean is going to be up in a couple kind of speakers to tell you about what the NOMCOM is doing. Please nominate people when that call comes. That is how you will get an IESG that you feel that you feel that should be there. What the other thing the IESG often says is that we are working on actively rotating the workforce and the cadre that is the working group chair and the most common thing that we have implemented is the we call it the one plus one. So very often if there's a new working group being spun up or perhaps it's a rechartering and the the working group team is being reconsidered, there would be an appointment of an experienced IETF chair and then bringing in someone that has not prior had chairing kind of experience And that allows kind of a mentoring kind of team that the person without IETF chairing experience can work with someone that is experienced but we're injecting that that those kind of new individuals into that work for cadre I mean we've said the work And so I just wanted to report out on kind of what that looks"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:20:00",
    "text": "like in terms of recent IESG actions. I don't have to full kind of historical data, but if you look at what we did in terms of appointments for the last year, so from June to June of last year, 37 working group chair appointment were made, and about 60% of those were what we did in terms of appointments for the last year, so from June to June of last year, 37 working group chair appointments were made, and about 60% of those working group chair appointments were new people that at prior had no chairing experience at the IETF. And if you're wondering if we implemented the one plus one, why isn't it lower, why isn't it closer at kind of 50%? Because you're ADs were also appointing as they were rotating out perhaps two experienced chairs they they were likely rotate in someone that did not have prior experience and that's why we're pushing 60%. And the IESG believes that that's really the path they're going to continue on in the future. The other set of feedback, we've got around working for chair appointments is that chairs are in that job too long So I wanted to share with the community, the pretty much a distribution on how long working group chairs, the appointments have been in their particular kind of job. So you can see the exit with the community, the pretty much a distribution on how long working group chairs, the appointments have been in their particular kind of job. So you can see the X axis there is years of appointment And, you know, the top line I'd like to get us to say is that about half of the cadre right now and that half of that cadre has only been there four years or less there are certainly you know they've been there kind of much longer about about how the workforce is is only been there four years okay another common question less at the plenary, but offline is we've had a lot of change in how the IE is structured. We, uh, eliminated the TSV area as a top line area We created the WIT area. We reorganized a lot of different work groups and the composition of the IETF at the area level looks a little different. So I wanted to share with the community what does that look like by different measures we have previously used to size kind of areas So what you see there is how big particular areas are measured by how many ADs they have assigned, how many working groups they have, how many adults"

Thank you for Robert for pulling some of that data so you can got to get a sense that routing is a third of the IETF measured by kind of documents and kind of page count And that that all is a little bit of lie there are 3 AD got to get a sense that routing is a third of the IETF measured by kind of documents and kind of page count. That is a little bit of lie there are three ADs, and you can kind of take a look at the different facts and figures The other reason I'm kind of sharing that is if you are interested in kind of standing to be an AD in one of these particular areas, this is just a reminder is that all the areas are a little bit different your best source of information if you are interested in being in AD in an area, is talk to the current ADs, talk to former kind of ADs. They'll get to give you a sense because then the areas are kind of slowly different and you can give you a sense of kind of workload and what all of that means And then the last chart, the last series of charts, I wanted to bring up, one of which I shared earlier is the, I guess, in the chair report coming into the meeting is we often hear a little bit of feedback around what is document processing look like. So the thing I wanted to share is the I IESG has kind of heard you we think the answer is additional transparency in the pipeline and we have been working with the tools team to identify what additional dashboards would look like to give you a sense of where things are, how long kind of things are taking We have those features requests in. The tools team is working on them We expect them to drop in the Datatracker towards the fall and towards the, towards the end of this year. Since to my knowledge, we haven't shared this with the community. This hasn't been popped up. I want to put up a couple of figures to just give you a sense of the in and out of the IESG with a time bin of just going from meeting to meet which is a bit of a cadence, a lot of working groups work on roughly 40 to 70 documents are sent to an IESG between an IESG meeting. So one would anticipate between now and Dublin, about 45 to 70 documents would be sent from all the working groups into the IESG for processing. We would roughly expect, based"

    "text": "on that historical data that a slightly lower number than that would be popping out from the IESG, perhaps previously set than just the last meeting, and we would be sending them to the to the RFC editor. I've gotten some immediate questions about that chart and I will fully admit it's a little kind of crude and kind of the first question is but the orange bar but the in the blue bar shouldn't they be equal and if they're disproportional is that saying someone is falling behind? The answer is there's a lot of kind of additional detail that's really needed to unpack that. What we can definitively say with the data polls, we have is blue is definitely the concrete number of documents in that time bin that the working groups have sent as to why the orange bar looks the way it looks. That is one part the IESG no question after a document leaves the working group It is on 80s to do all sorts of processing. But remember that the time and the different different folks part participating in the process from after the working group all the way to when the document is sent to the RFC editor, there are multiple cycles in that loop. So as a result of AD review, there may be revised documents that need to have And so the working group and the draft offers are participating in that, due to with feedback that comes from last call, director at reviews, and IESG and IESG reviews and a little more fidelity until all that all those different states is exactly some of the some of the new dashboards that the tools team has that we hope to deliver to the community at the end of the year. The other, figure i have is much more kind of narrow we've gotten feedback in the past around the wait time around publication requested, colloquially called here kind of PubREC. So these are the documents that have been sent to an AD, but they have not been serviced at all So the AD has not yet gotten to read them So I wanted to kind of share the distribution of snapshot in time not a historical kind of sense, like what the queue looks like two days ago. There were 32 documents set by work groups and you can see the distribution there Kind of top line, the numbers are 85% of what's in the public"

We managed to bring, I think, seven people to the meeting this time. We have some breakdowns of the gender violence of the attendees and the geographic location where they came from on the slide there I think this is a fantastic program we've managed to bring a couple of people back several times to start making connections As I say, very grateful to the sponsors"

But the everything I wanted to highlight, is that we have been developing in the IRA a code of conduct for the IRF IRF The ITI has had a code of conduct, RFC 7 754, for a number of years which is focused on effective conduct of the standards process Up until now, there hasn't been an IETI code of conduct We have the anti-harassment policy, we have the documents about the Ombuds team, we have the inclusive language guidelines and all of those processes which are shared and in common with the I the IETF, but we haven't had a specific iRTF code of conduct I think one is needed to focus on the effect conduct of research in the IRTF and this is something we've been developing in the RIESG for the last year or so The Draft, Draft Perkins, I are Code of Conduct, currently version 03 You see it on the slide with the table of contents there The IRSG believes this is now essentially finished. We are planning on issuing a last call for this document in the next few weeks so if you are interested in this please do read it. Please send feedback either directly to the IRSG or to the IRTF discuss list and as i say we are planning on finalizing this in the next few weeks, if possible I think that's all I have Thank you and pass over to the NomCon"

And I'm saying fine it's a learning process. And I have to say my first noncom experience was quite opening and I learned quite a lot about how the IETF is functioning. The reason for all this is introduction is to try to say to people that, hey, NOMCOM is not that scary and more of you should be volunteering to join as NOMCOM members because it would make the future NOMCOM chair's job also easier and with a wider selection we would get a more hopefully more diverse voting members people and they will be able to improve the process because one of the NOMCOM goals is continuous improvement of the process that we are applying to select our leadership"

There are, if you look at the IDF Trust Board, you can find out who are the members and you can see what experience was it for them Then for the IETF trust it's one position The IETF trust is encouraging longer engagements for I mean so that they can have the historic knowledge But it's always good to bring in a fresh blood and the new points of view So please, if you are interested in the governance of the IETF property that would be a great area for you to take a look.

We've actually issued zero new RFC licenses since we met last time. We haven't had a couple of inquiries, though, but, you know, can I use this and how do I do that we had two of those come in and we've resolved them by working with the requester in a way that they were quite happy when they went away, but they didn't need to write any new licenses to make that happen. And the really, really good news is we have also not sued anybody since we last met and that's always a good statistic by the way so far my my time on the trust, we've sued nobody.

But the good news is we did the consultation the answer came back yet that seems like a good idea we then created the bylaw and we created the corporation. It was phase two. And now we're at phase three. The phase three part is we spun up the new guy We got to move the assets from the old tribe over to the new corporation and then do all the final clean And if you've ever moved houses, you know that final cleanup is always the hardest.

There is no real easy solution for this so we are doing what we can but overall if people have problems coming to some countries generally our best way around that is to balance that out over a number of years by going to multiple different countries where people can get to and can do those things rather than necessarily being able to solve it for a specific country So that's our list of future meeting locations and venues.

We sent a message about that, I don't know, I feel like two, three weeks ago because both Sean and I are term limited, and we've both been on since the beginning of the board so we thought it was kind of important to make sure we figured out a way to transition all of that working knowledge if you will. And then the last point, which is new which is another IASA 2 reviews So when IASA 2 was completed, in those documents, it said that after three years, we will do a review and see if there were things that should be tweaked, adjust and so on, on the working theory that instead of waiting every 10 years to do a review and doing a big change that we would like to have smaller, more iterative changes. So we did that already. That's that first one was completed. But at the end of that we said this would be a great thing to continue and do every roughly three years. So that year is this year We'll soon be opening up a consultation about it and sort of provide our draft of what that looks like and ask for comment and ask for additional items with the objective to finish that by the November meeting in Dublin and we'll present, you know, results then And as always, we have a multitude of ways to contact us.

So we've got that going again So both of those are archiving RFCs again going forward The other part of me of preservation is trying to make sure that the links in our references in the RFCs also stay alive because that is part of the context of all of the things that you work on so hard We do have a very low rate of link rot in the RFCs compared to the general internet which is fantastic and is testament to all of you doing a very good job. But we do have deadlock in the RFCs compared to the general internet, which is fantastic and is testament to all of you doing a very good job. But we do have dead links in the archive.

I want to talk about, well, I want to talk about Warren being an eggplant, but apart from that, I want to talk about the blue and orange lines, bars Yeah, I mean, documents go through the area directors the area directors are busy people they don't always get to things immediately. It gets back to the authors. The authors have to make changes. The authors are very busy people. They don't always get to things quickly and the working group chairs maybe don't and etc etc so et cetera. So this kind of goes with something I've been pushing for a long time, that there's this thing called a document shepherd who should be doing more than just writing up the shepherd write up. And most of the time, we limit our shepherding to writing up the shepherd write up and then go back to drinking beer and being in eggplant So for years, I've been suggesting that the document shepherds should be more active and be bugging people and poking and saying this document's been sitting around in this state for a while it needs an update, it needs a review, it needs this, it needs that, and keep following it through because you're jon peterson with one document you have a little bit more time than the rest of us eggplants So that's, that's all a little bit more time than the rest of us eggplants. So that's all. A good reminder that the document shepherds could be helping us more. Great Thank you very. Oh sorry, I didn't see. Yes, Warren. A for the record Sunflower And it's also got a bumble bee And B, it's actually really helped if sort of participants volunteer to be document ship shepherds it's a really good way to get some experience sort of and learn what being chair is like.

Thank you very much for the slew of numbers you did in your introductory slide I wondered if you considered the fact if you think that they're working group chairs who have been in place for more than a deck if that's a problem. And if so, do you have any plans to address that issue? Yeah, we're in early stages in polling kind of some of that data and kind of going through what the implications are we've been kind of focusing on the front end we are in preliminary conversations about what to do in the back end and in the early conversations we've had and kind of looking at it's really on a case-by-case basis and so at this point out of the 80s, are thinking through really on a on a, per-person kind of basis, what makes sense in those positions And that's the deep dive we're doing. Thanks Any other kind of comments? Sure Yeah, please. Let me add to that that it is easier for us to remove long-term chairs with new people if there's a bunch of new people that we can choose from. That unfortunately is not always the case. Yeah, but you do have the chance and egg problem if we don't know who has been there for very long, it's hard to say, oh, I'd be willing to be a routing chair or an ops chair so so for instance speaking for myself, I'm always actively looking for security chairs, even if there's no current position opening I would like to have a can of them available, and I don't Sure, but security wasn't the issue of the people who've been in the role for a decade and oh sorry Warren I'm going to keep scanning now how's it yeah I mean also I mean that's a good point something which we've also done in some areas and working groups is actually sent out like Google"

One of the things it says is the Ombuds team is responsible for devising and documenting their operating practices These practices must be discussed with the Ombuds and published in a publicly visible place such as on the IETF website And it was understandable that in the first couple of years, the processes weren't written up because they were being developed and it's a cell self-organizing team but what I years, the processes weren't written up because they were being developed and it's a self-organizing team. But what I'd like to do is ask you to put a bit of pressure on them now to get those processes properly published Adrian, your point is well taken, like you said, it's been eight years. I've already spoken, I've become my conversation with the Ombuds team, realizing they have a tremendous amount of independence from me and the IESG.

So would you consider that? to set, I don't know, on 20, hours deadline for reviewing the documents? before the telechad or make a fake teletele? date 24 hours before?

So it's about setting a timer by which director reviews are what? Ideally, yes, so all comments and review if it's possible, could be done 24 hours before the telechats so all sorts have 24 hours to address them because if i'm getting a comment to our before the telechart, I might be already asleep Got it.

If you, if you rate information conceivably to make that discussion useful, right? If you raise a discuss on a document and you say, I don't get this if the author has the answer or the working group has the answer to your question, ahead of the telechat, you will then be able to rationally discuss it during the telechat. If you don't give time for that interaction to happen, before the telechat, that means you've got to roll another two weeks before something actually takes place that is a discussion I'm not saying that this is going to work every time, but I think that goal of getting those comments in so that you can get responses before the telechat is really ideal.

The fact that the IETF hotel turns out to be the cheaper option if you could get a room is startling but, and so, and I really do think we should ask if people like didn't make it here because they're or were delayed because of crowd struck I think it's just you useful for us to know that we have that dependency, you know, there So and I was very interested, Roman, in your, your con about the number of fee waivers"

And so actually my question, really for you is, given that you know, historically meetings were, we made money on meetings and we funded the secretariat and then things are no longer that way, meetings mostly lose money So the question becomes is as a group, not just as the IETF LLC, but as the whole industry, can we still afford to do three meetings a year? and we've talked about going on online as an environmental thing but now I'm wondering if we just need to do that because we can't afford to actually do the anymore and that I feel almost like we're really imperiling our work. That I'm aware of work that for instance has sat and discusses for three or four months simply because the authors were taken off of IETF work, right?

This was my first time approving fee waivers so I don't have a lot of historical precedent for the nature of how the request would come in. You seem to kind of express some concern about longstanding participants that may be caught short and what might be the interplay of that around kind of fee waivers? Well, so I know of for instance, I know of one, I know of one long standing participant who, you know, whose company wouldn't pay him to be here this week. It wouldn't pay his fee, but you know, as it turns out, he lives here, kind of right?

Maybe they didn't ask for fee waivers maybe they figured it out maybe they're participating remotely instead And so my impression is that even though our numbers are way up, my impression is that there's a lot of negative pressure towards doing IETF work that I feel like it's really appeared in the last six months and that it's not like the IETF's not relevant anymore, but like no one can afford to do it anymore Yeah, so again, I'm gonna answer the little question and then try to talk about the bigger question in having no kind of particular kind of guidance on what to do with it Yeah, so again, I'm going to answer the little question and then try to talk about the bigger question.

Or you can vector me in Well, I'm sort of trying to say that it's not just I can't afford to get to the meeting it's it's that it appears to be, I'm only going to be able to spend time remotely on the meeting or on my draft on my vacation because my boss doesn't want me to do them, not applying to me actually, but because boss has something else is higher priority and so the fact that you know it's hard to get to the meeting, that's just an at a, a simple of the lack. Meanwhile, we don't have enough working group chairs. We don't have enough NOMCOM volatient here You know, we can't fund ADs. Thank you for putting that that slide up with the people who were funding AD but we still don't know how to, we still have that problem 20 years since my first non- NOMCOM, that we can't pick anybody we want, we got to pick somebody who"

I think most ADs have not said that they are full-time but by it's it's numbers. It's a 50% commitment of an 80-hour week that was the NOMCOM quote from 2003 Well, that's right. Well 2003 seems like an awfully long time ago. What I'm trying to say is that I certainly was not active. What I'm trying to say is that it has not changed that much news that hasn't changed. It hasn't gone worse, but it also hasn't gone better. We'll take it as noted. I think we see the bigger point you're making. And in terms of the remote or sort of, you know, online only meetings and changing the frequency, I think to a large extent, we are implemented of what the IESG wants to do in terms of that structure. It doesn't mean that we can't help facilitate that conversation. So I think we can carry that forward Probably also some items to note in the ISA 2 you know, to sort of open up some fundamental questions about, you know, that structure even though we might not be able from the LLC stage standpoint, be able to make that decision. I think that it would be useful if we had a conscious decision that the say, the funding model for ADs is we thought about it and we're not going to change it and that's okay but i think that should be part of the I ask a review are we getting this right do we need to be semi-professional standards? No one really here wants to do that, but like, you know, are there other things we can do that would make? workload lighter or different or move? things around? Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of this is also for the IESG because you're talking yes it is total process of this is probably not LLCPT. I fought hard as to which when to click my button, right? But yeah. Quick one, Jay? Can you, since you've written your notes, can you send me the question?"

    "text": "you think I should be asking in the survey? I didn't write them in my notes, but I'll send them to you. Thank you. And on the funding part, I can only speak to the affordability of things for us as the LLC The IETF is a long-term organization. It's not a short profit-driven organization. And that's evidenced entirely by its history So that means taking the rough with the smooth some years without over overreacting. So we're not going to see great layoffs and things you know if we're going to end up trying to maintain a particular profit ratio, and anything like that That does mean that there had things happen to be put in place to help ease the pain, though and it does mean that you will see certain shifts in things, so I imagine you'll see a shift from corporate funded people to slightly more government-funded people because government can weather these downturns better sometimes than corporate can and things it's a natural change and I think that there are things that we can do to make that better but my view is don't panic, it will change within a couple of years and we'll go back to a different time. All right, thanks mike bishop. Thank you. Thanks So mike bishop, Akamai I will echo a couple of comments about travel disruption. I was one of a couple people that I know of that were planning to be on site and are now remote because we couldn't get there before me meetings started. And I decided the meetings were more important than me being on the airplane. I am curious if the numbers that were shared at the start are the number of people who actually showed up versus the number of people who registered and how many people have flipped And yes, I also agree with Michael before me that we should ask in the survey did you originally plan to be removed or were you remote for some other reason that happened, you know, whether it was visa, travel lodging, like, why, why were"

Yeah, so I think we'll take that as noted great feedback about the kind of questions we should ask in the follow-up and try to dig into a little bit more about why was it, you know, a crowd strike issue was it a, you know, last-minute travel, you know, budget cut etc and as well like we won't know some of the final numbers until really Friday because sometimes people register for the week might not come until later in the week So some of that, you know, won't be known until you know, Friday comes around Thank you. All right. Next up, Andrew Hi, andrew campling I was appalled in Brisbane, well, by two things, the coffee, but that's by the by the budget gender figures, which if I apologize if I misremember it, but I think we had a low point of 7.6% female participation in Brisbane Again, apologies if I miss it I don't think we've had the numbers for here yet. Sorry, if I it doesn't feel like we've actually grasped this as something that we actually want to do something about. I mean, various people have acknowledged that it's a problem but no I don't think there's anything in plan to do anything And 7.6% is appalling. It's well below the industry standard. I think WRIPE was about 20-something percent. So which is not great, but it's a hell of a lot better than 7% standard. I think Ripe was about 20 something percent, which is not great, but it's a hell of a lot better than 7.6. So it would be fantastic to see if you know let's take this seriously let's measure it let's do something about it rather than just... Well, we absolutely take it seriously We've got, you know, a whole diversity program under which you know a bunch of initiatives including sisters are located we've got funders now for a lot of that stuff where we didn't really before"

    "text": "um but it's a tough problem to solve there's no doubt about that and part of it goes to the initial funnel of people that begin participating and, you know, how welcome they feel you know, do they return. So there's been a lot of service stuff around new participants and, you know, their experiences and, you know, whether they return and so on. We are open to any very specific suggestions about how to do better in this area. So please feel free to offer them. But we're going to continue to focus on it. We agree Thank you. Next up is Braun Thanks for the coffee comment, by the way I was actually going to speak about that. We have things like phrase coffee, lots and lots of snacks all the way through the meeting when we're talking about the cost of things I think that's probably what's looking at as well is how much are we making this? a really nice place to be, but also is that our focus, or is our focus to work? My other question was about this meeting, particularly the plenary session, looking around the room, I think we have maybe a quarter of the people who are on site at IETF, come to the place session. I know a lot of people who say, I'm not going to bother going to the plenary session. It could be an email It's probably worth looking at whether this is a valuable session with the format that it is now and how much of people's time you're getting value out of thanks okay thank you all right Dean So there is a down-upression of many corporate that they are saying, reduce your IT was the value for us because it's not anymore with the people who are thinking about technology, it's more about the people who are counting the money. And then it's sometimes very hard to persuade the people who are counting the money in this extra budget Because long term, that will be a good investment but many people are doing the short-term decisions. One other thing would I would be interested from the survey, you're saying, oh, this many people"

    "text": "are participating. It would be interesting to know how many people participate less than five times, how many participants are active draw authors over that period of time. Because just looking at the number, it can be quite a bit Many people come to the IETF to see if they could get engaged and you might have a lot of those people who it's bad to call them IETF tourists but they come in it's hey it's nearby would like to learn more about it and see if I will get the involved or not. And this could give us some number because I'm participating for the past 25 years, and there is a small group of people that are the same phases over the 25 years. And they're changing the working group and changing the areas, but it's a pretty core group and there has been quite a number of people that were participating for a while. And then they left because they said i'm not interesting in the area anymore that IETF works. What I was working was finished change my career moved on but all in all, if I would put all the together, I could not get to the number of like 800 participants. So some classification of those number of participants over like the past five years because the data is there would be good to have and then make some you know there's a little from there fair enough thanks and i'm sure you know one of the input there is new working groups and new areas and so on so important for some of the, you know, groups like IESG Clea? I wanted to say that I'm slightly confused about why you can't give more of the like, support the people who are requesting for waivers having fee waivers like I don't understand the limit there seems to be lots of room here and lots of food outside"

    "text": "um so that's a and i want to say that i got a fee waiver for my second meeting as local in San Francisco arias i could afford to pay the fee because i didn't have to get on an airplane I really wanted to continue participating and I could figure out how to get to Prague and pay for a super cheap hotel and I said, the one variable cost is sort of making it affordable was asking for a fee waiver. And I almost got rejected because at the time it was said to me that they only gave fee waivers to very local people So anyways, I think I'm just curious about that. You don't have to answer it. I'm just name it as like, I don't get it. I lead in a event where we give fee waivers basically to anybody who asks, especially if they're active participants and new people and we never have a problem So it's just a question Okay And I think if you want to grow this community, so that it has longevity, like I look around and I'm like, I'm a young person here, and I'm not that young, right? There's some how do we think about growing? younger participation too? It's not just about gender and it's not just about the rest of the world. It's also like inviting younger folks to be here so this organization sustains itself. Okay thank you Mark? Yeah, I just was sitting listening and kind of contemplating. I sit on a board of another technical community that has an active and opinionated group of people. And I just wanted to say, thank you you're doing a pretty good job. So thanks All right"

Yeah Tobias Fivich, MaxPug Institute for Informatics, speaking for myself And when I try to click on the, like, join on on-site tool button, it was already 1931 and it wasn't there anymore, that's why I didn't queue I wanted to reemphasize the point that we did have a discussion about the cost of attending IETF, followed by a statement that everything is being done to increase diversity within the community, and I'd like to point out that those two points as already said our colleague are there, are very much related because especially if you look if you say things like we are well below industry standard if you do have additional cost associated and participating in the IETF which might only be our arguing with your boss that it's actually worthwhile to go there well, you might actually prioritize that when you already are disadvantaged in your job role So this connection, I think, needs to be further explored also in the context of increasing diversity within the community. Thank you Don't see anything else. Thank you very much, everybody the session is over. Yay remember, you can still give later, even if you filled out the survey. Thank you that was my line All right. Thank you, everyone. And have a good rest of your evening, and that's the end of our plenary session"
