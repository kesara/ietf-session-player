    "text": "however there is some applications where even during the session and if the network has not been forgotten over a period of time the mac address is reset and this impacts like i said the the earlier conditions such as troubleshooting access control one prime example is you know you visit a hotel you go through a captive portal you go out for several hours or a day and you come back now you have to go through that process again because your your mac address has changed so it becomes a very repetitive reduces the user experience based on that as we you know as indicated above privacy is paramount so with the rcm it does ensure address privacy or device privacy and it helps prevent tracking as well as snooping or interfering or putting out a rogue device that could mirror a actual device that is connecting so in in this while we're looking at the different solutions one thing we found that was very key is there is no one set solution that solves it all it's it's not a single solution to blanket all use cases but that a set of solutions could be used to cover most of the the use cases however that some of these solutions actually will conflict with the with each other so they can't be used in harmony and this this wraps up all the basic findings that we found the"

    "text": "that the ap gives an identifier then the station comes back and decides to re-express that identifier if it wants to be still identified or doesn't do it if it doesn't want to be identified next time some others say well no it's the station that's going to express an identifier and if it wants to be identified again the next time then within the secure connection to the access point it's going to re-express the same identifier and some others say well no it has to be a sort of combined agreement between the two where they express a sort of algorithm for example which means that as the station changes its mac address the ap can process a computation that recognizes that the next identifier is the same as the one before um so that is that is the status of where bh is they are a little bit late uh they were starting to um they were planning to have a text uh by this uh march they don't have it yet and they're still discussing which of these solutions should be adopted and how etc um but their target is short they express the intent to be finished by the end of the next year and there's another group which is longer term which is bi and what these people do is that they look at 80.11 and try to identify if there is a way to augment the privacy of devices within 80.11 it's obvious that anybody can sniff the network um so they want to see there are some identifiers sent in 8 11 frames um that could expose you know the um uniquely uh the identity of a device you know beyond the mac address mac address being just one of them and of course they identified tons of them um so for now they are going through combing the standards and they have try to make requirements on what exactly should be protected and against what um so that's an interesting work for us to look at um and of course you know their approach is very much focused on these first two layers you know the thigh and the back layer um so the uh and that's what we most of us know right that there are some keys that you exchange for which you um make an identification by saying i'm reusing key number 55 when you rejoin"
