    "text": "problem probably but if it is a problem then this document doesn\u0027t need to solve so done as I said we added some considerations about the security of the thing in particular the mainly about increases the surface that you have and the related mitigations and and we also took into account a comment that John did last time in Singapore and so basically your observation or as a star is not tied to the specific identity that the certificates the short-term certificate has embedded and so it\u0027s better decoupling the couple it\u0027s from from from the domain name specificity and and and so we we now call it a identity owner not a domain name owner and I said so we think we\u0027re ready for working group let\u0027s cool unless there are concerns any comments anybody how many of read the draft Oh Oh quite a few good so people think this is ready for less call and see a lot of nods from the crowd thank you yes Ryan Ryan sleepy so I have heard the draft I think it\u0027s good for working group last call but I am going to throw out a potential ranch which having having looked through some of the use cases and scenarios I think it\u0027s very unlikely that this would be useable on the web PKI yeah I think for you know an enterprise case it is it is fit for task but you know I I do want to sort of potentially throw that out there that for the web PGI case for some of its considerations the comparison between OCSP stapling the the motivating cases here and the ecosystem challenges may not make it suitable so if it is something that we do want to see on the web PKI we should probably talk about some of the operational considerations and deployment considerations to figure out if if that\u0027s something addressable through the spec but if it\u0027s for enterprise PKI let\u0027s let\u0027s ship it we\u0027d like to address the web use case so if we have this discussion would be nice Oh what are what are the blockers so one of the blockers is that CAS themselves I have strong opposition to soar removing OCSP information war towards expressing short-lived certificates as an equivalent for OCS P so this is a very fundamental objection all right because "

    "text": "it gets to the whole point of the use case and there have been multiple discussions in the C a browser forum for the course of three years now and this matter continues to be a point of contention so that is something that you know in looking through whether it is through the analysis document that is you know correlated to star whether or not that needs to be firmed up or whether it is actually to the protocol itself so that is is you know one of the core considerations there is the operational deployment of you know if a server is capable of deploying Hackney star then they\u0027re equally capable of deploying OCSP stapling whether or not OCSP stapling meets that case there\u0027s also from looking through the sort of security risks and considerations is this providing a meaningful value for the web PKI in a web peek threat model you know it does allow for the shorter lift certificates you run into the issue you know that is mentioned of like where the wild where the wild warnings are of client clock skew but you also run into the situations where the model of continuing to reuse the same key for these short-lived certificates and rotating once you detect compromise whether or not that actually achieves security desired security properties in a web context and I\u0027m pretty good thinking in the case of an HP context so it may be perfectly suitable for an smtp context right and that\u0027s again going back to considerations like I don\u0027t want to throw a wrench in here for saying this this won\u0027t have a chance but it is one that in the see a browser forum there is a lot of strong opposition towards this model of exploring that so it is there\u0027s going to be a tension here and it\u0027s it\u0027s really really hard stuff again like I think it\u0027s mostly matured I think it\u0027s ready for a working group last call but in the sort of web PKI deployment case there may and almost very likely will need to be changes both in considerations and probably in protocol to reflect that industry reality and I don\u0027t know if whether that comes as Biss whether that comes as a denim doc like I don\u0027t know from a process point and I don\u0027t want to say I don\u0027t want to hold up process on what can effectively be considered possibly flood of like you know CAS don\u0027t like this but sure but that\u0027s that\u0027s the consideration so I do want to put that out there just talk that\u0027s very interesting thank you very much but it contrasts with what we had as a feedback from CAS um I think that Keefe so yeah way to send them if you read the the lamps mailing list there was a message today or yesterday from dr. Paula but all is objections to for Tim certificates or forgoing relocation and you might want to read that yeah much of it applies here as well yeah I mean from the sea-air browser point of view I think the correct way of characterizing the the position of the majority of the CAS on short-lived certificates is the majority of them don\u0027t care there are a few that are interested in issuing them "

    "text": "the last time it came up the biggest debate was actually I forgot my name I\u0027m Kim Halik the biggest debate was actually between Jeremy Raleigh and me with me actually being on the opposition side and the opposition was actually solely based on not wanting to remove the CRL pointers from the certificates even if they were short-lived so the actual discussion was not whether certificates should be short-lived or not but whether you should actually have a crl pointer in them or whether it was okay to remove that so that\u0027s where that went I think you know there are a lot of people including us who would like to see widespread adoption of short-lived certificates there are several CAS that especially larger ones that have been in that camp for a long time and so I wouldn\u0027t assume that CAS are necessarily going to come out against that thank you yeah Phil Han Baker I\u0027m no longer a CA yeah I\u0027m on the browser side yeah that that\u0027s my feeling from Brett see a browser forum in that there been a lot of people myself included who\u0027ve been very strongly in favor of short-lived certs however before it is practical to do that you have to have a standard for a certificate issue and automate the whole lifecycle so your document is going to be a precondition for changing things in cab forum so I wouldn\u0027t make anything kept for unblocking because we need this draft and we need to spec before we can go to cab forum on the CRLs I think that you\u0027re still going to want crl distribution points in you\u0027re not going to want to you could get rid of the OCSP piece but there is an issue where you have certificates that have been revoked for cause where you want to actually have it on record that they were revoked at a particular time which as opposed was Mac\u0027s main objection right because I\u0027ve talked to him and yeah we don\u0027t we in the document we don\u0027t have any normative language in terms of OCSP or crl distribution points so completely leave use of that John Peterson not on the web PKI about on another use case for us the ster thing we have astir short-lived document that I\u0027ve kind of been like putting on the back burner until May the changes appreciate very much but as part of this of working class call I\u0027d be I\u0027d be happy to go and try and plug it in and see if I find any part edges that are things that might be suggestions from that but that\u0027s all I wanted to say thank you Richard runs it seems like there\u0027s a lot of non normative non protocol text in here that might be distracting to people in evaluating its compliance against the web Pai it seems like the main technical protocol overlap was in this question Ryan ranged about reissuance with the same key pair same subject key pair and that that seems "
