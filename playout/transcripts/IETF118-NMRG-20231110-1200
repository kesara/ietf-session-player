I'm Coacheff, and M and JVs, just to briefly remind you that, we are following the, not well as the AITF on different aspects. The first one on intellectual property. So please have a look and wait as a slide. Although I want to remind you regarding the audio and video recordings that, the meetings are recorded. Just remind you, also regarding the privacy and code of conduct, really important that, you you read this slide, please. And important also, we want to remind you that an emerging is, a research group. So it's part of the IRTF. We are conducting research. So the main focus is on developing standard. Plus, of course, we can publish some informational of experimental documents in RFC series. But the main focus is on a long longer term research. Okay. Here are the links for the for the meeting today. Of course, you can also have a look and the and the notes, if you want to add something in the note as So, yeah, I know, very quick updates.

Of course, this needs some, more step to be refined and there's always been more inter meeting on that. And, for instance, in principle, we we have more, let's say, regular interim meeting in the next, coming month in order to progress in the different of the research agenda of the group, So, of course, we'll send some poll to find some good time slots training tools who accommodate different time zones. Know, that we have, as many participant as positive Also, we want to highlight that you have, different, let's say, research group document, and we like the document to ask publications. So in the, next week, the ID will be to, also assess the maturity of this reby them if I've needed. And, of course, you know, the at the end to, to go for publication So, yes, this process would be initiated offline through the mailing list. And, no, we'll enter into the into the different presentation of meeting here is agenda. So agenda is quite full. So we really ask as a presenter to really, keep time. And so he have seen a timer during your presentation. So invite, for the first presentation, Well, hi, everyone. It's good to see you again. Natural dimming is from Telefonica.

Semantic interoperability, what is this, it, copes with, with all the data heterogeneity that we must find in the network It's about, having distributed sources and consumers and, helping them to understand each other. Based on on agreed semantics. You know? And in particular, there are 2 approaches, to data management approaches that try to tackle this heterogeneity one is the damage where, it focuses on on decentralizing the data management at scale. So in this in this particular case, interoperability is a must semantic interoperability is a must. And, also, the is, is the same story, this this approach tries to complain. To combine, data from, it's a Regina sources. No. So agreeing on common or common semantics, will allow to integrate data, you know, to to combine all all of it bet to understand, semantic turbality, we must, focus and understand what are the levels of data modeling. Which is what you see on the on the right. The first level is the, conceptual level or soul sometimes known as informational level, which is, about business concepts. It's just, how do you deal with our problem and concepts that are involved in that problem. And how they relate to each other. You know? And then, there's the physical level. Which is how you land those concepts to the technology that you are using to solve your your program. No? So for example, case of of the technology that I'm using is, is is general. It could be it could be a case. So the the point here is that knowledge for us"

No? This is what we understand as as ontology is Also, not across our self defining because, what they do is they, they represent the data along with its semantic metadata. You know? So so the meaning travels with with the data. Anyone can understand the the data you have in the in the graph. You know? And also, graphs our disability in nature. Since we are, aiming at, decentralizing data management, graphs, they provide a flexible structure that allows to, to combine it. So I wanted to to to show some some examples of them is young library, where we, we see, some hidden, knowledge in these modules that we should be able to extract, you know, that that knowledge. So as you can see here in the library, we find some common concepts scatter in the in the in the model. You know, one of them is the concept of young model. And another is the module. But, what the difference here lies in the in the relationships. No. So, we must find a way to extract this that this knowledge from from the ARM model is not in the same line, it happens with, with the management of interfaces. This is a typical use case where we have a different, down modules for interface management developed by different organizations or or vendors. No? 1 from Open Coffee, one from IETF, another for from vendors. But, as you can see, there are total independent modules that refer to a common concept. Which is, interface"

We have seen, multiple development efforts, just focus, you know, Dan, one of one of them is, the law authority. This, a a mature mythology inspired by, got some more development. Here, this is more, let's say, manual mythology were the domain experts and the oncology developers collaborate together And for example, this methodology has been used to develop the, the Etsy tariff, on solar, you know, which is, a standard for IoT. Another approach is the semi automatic extraction of knowledge. This is something that we have been exploring, where we are trying to track that knowledge from from the young modules based on the structure of the, of the day tunnel. So, for example, we could say that statements like young list or young containers could map to NTTC in your in your knowledge graph. Or, junk leave a good map to a property or a relationship you know, like, trust depending on the, on the data type. And there are also, other approaches like the 1 called, Maya, Maya paper. That, in this case, these these authors are working, are proposing to use on supervised machine learning to, identify this common concept among, independent jam audio. So and to do that, they do not only a process or or or consider the structure of the of the junk data. But they also, analyze parameters like the name using the identifiers of of, of your junk notes, the descriptions, the types and and the references included in the in the model. No?"

It requires, semantic modeling skills, experts in, you know, colleges, but also, domain expertise, the help with the, from the, the people that are involved in, in those problems, And the the thing is ontologies are one of the the, the core, elements in the creation of, of knowledge graphs. No? And, also, I I I finally talked about Jang, but keep in mind that, we want to combine, any kind of data. It's not all again. We will have SNMP. Net flow metrics from Prometheus, all sorts of data. That's why we need to, why we need this semantic interoperability. You know? So they said, we we are looking for for for feedback, and, from the group and, or if anyone is interested in, in in exploring this this, this topic some ideas that could cause up these these discussions, one of the things is is keep exploring these mythologies or or toolings that I that I just don't know. So if if if some could be used to extract that knowledge, that, ontologists from from from young models, And also, we we could also start investigating on on how can we, extend maybe, Jan, to to provide that semantic annotation, you know, for example, I I remember here, mailing the in backing Yeah.

Think we have Jeff Freight. Hi, Jeffrey Heinz. So your last two points actually hit about 5 different conversations I've had this week a long list let times, and suggest, Benoit closest person to follow-up with in terms of, the depth conversation crushing over everything. Annotations are a wonderful place for this stuff to go in the current Yang language. The your specific problem space, a module that defines a ontological element that you're trying to say, you know, interface as an example. Being able to say this is an interface and then proceed to have references to all the different things that are interfaces across the modules, at specific versions. This is an important detail. And, the second thing that gets done part of that work is also augmenting each of the target modules. To be able to say this is a type of the thing doing both things allows you from one position to find all related elements, and the second one with the annotations in the module allows you to find other things the other direction. So this forward and reverse semantic is very important. Together. Any agree. You. We have other questions to match our product If not, thanks a lot, Natalia. Thank you. We have to go to the airport.

So, basically, with semantic metadata annotation for network anomaly detection, be going in a very similar direction, but focusing on, network anomaly detection. And our motive is, it should help our work helps to test and validate compared outside detection systems. And should we, like a stepping stone going towards supervised and semi supervised machine learning development. And especially, as we will see data also, one of the challenges we have is that, in anomalies, it's not something you have a lot. So, the more you have, the better. And by actually cooperating with different operators and academia together, we believe, helping them to exchange labeled data could improve those systems. And at the end, I was also not sure to Skype it's not only about semantics He also need to make it human available. So it goes towards, ontology. So first of all, network on the model, you take It's about monitoring VPNs or monitoring connectivity and routing tables, If we look, how, how do we, manage networks? We have 3 planes. We have control plane forward and plane and management playing according to the network telemetry framework.

And we have let's say just for transport alone, a hierarchy controller, eventually, another controller for a mobile network if it's about network. And then you have on top system. Information that arrives at the OSS system where you do alarm correlation or and any kind of automation. Yeah. Already strongly reduced. My question is, is this architecture with all these control as the stack of controllers suitable to do machine learning and correlation, or wouldn't it be better? To have, let's say, some kind of application doing a long correlation, which has access to all data one can think of from the network. I would say in general, like, forwarding plane, data plane, controlling, operational data is rather straightforward. Because, we we need standardization. To actually make controlled plane work. So, therefore, the semantics for control plane are well defined. Within the IPF.

So if you look at the the net, the the different, the 3 different network planes, forwarding plane control plane and management plane, looking at the option operational metrics, we see that basically it can be easily characterized in, these three areas where action means basically basically, what, is being performed in the in in this 3 planes. So for instance, in the forwarding plane. It could be forwarded or to or in the control plane, it could be an adjacency state change of an update and withdrawal, of past well, for reason, basically, here, me getting additional information. So for instance, we are dropping because, we no longer can forward, yeah, because the the network process unknown where for cause we're getting additional detail, for instance, why it is unreachable. So for instance, because we do not have a next hope, or, on the link layer level, we are unable to do, an up or enable discovery. So I have some questions. So first of all, from network per network operators' perspective. Would you agree that having such insights.

I won't be very curious to understand if your research, if you would receive from network operators labeled operational labeled incident data if, usage would, would benefit from them And then everybody, such same network symptoms, it help if we start standardizing those symptoms So if a non anomaly detection system is raising an alert and, linking to a symptom have a clear definition what these symptoms actually mean and I see that it's all on in the queue.

So we need some, functions that, for example, providing security to prevent access control, etcetera. So that no external, elements will compromise the function of the of the system. Okay. But all those kind of boosters must be specified and my people do it in this sense. K. Okay. So but we also, they have in more also this kind of flows. So we have internal flows. After we receive the data, process the data. We cooperate. We make all the services cooperate. To each other and then find some kind, let's say, some kind of solution to a problem or some kind of change to improve the network or something like that. That change is then let's say, enforce it to the network So we have all the service the reports. This scheme is pretty familiar with many, many schemes that we have previously received. Okay. So what we are not trying to revolutionize the natural management side. But but to evolve including many services, interacting to each other.

Thanks a lot for the very interesting, presentation. On one of your slides, you had some kind of communication over which all the various components communicate Yes. This one, it's called control and management service bus. Within the Oran Alliance, there is a concept called service management and orchestration, and there is an SMOS communication, and that looks very similar to, to what you have here. And my question is, have you already looked at, SMOS Architecture and SMOS communication and how that fits, to your architecture. Oh, we have not looked particularly on that, we are, more or less focusing on one a high level view, we have been, for example, working with, Apache Kasca but that is, for example, being used as bus in the in the OSM. Implementation. And we are also working in some more or less very early prototype of a different approach approach a very distributed bus. And that is similar to our reserve group.

We are connecting Kafka Services with our row. That task can also be corrected. It will fit perfectly in this kind of systems.

And, hopefully, after my presentation, I would like to kick start a debate on what this, a digital grid. So, before, While preparing this presentation, the first thing I did was to go to the and see whether there is a definition a proper definition of what is a digital pin for networks a what what they found was plenty of papers. Each one using its own definition. This was not consistent. Across the different papers or, documents So, pretty much I didn't find, an answer there. Actually, after reading the literature, my conclusion was that the the term has been abused it it is defined very poorly used, as a hot topic, to to attract interest for your paper, but not actually really seriously, and this is what I would like to doing this presentation, right, So no no consensus has been reached by the climate community. And there is no well established digital twin definition architecture of prototype for network. At least this is what I, I didn't found it. K. If you find it, let me know. And you can find the paper supporting pretty much whatever definition I want. And the goal of this presentation is to see whether we can have this debate at the network, management research. And actually, I think that will make, if there is enough interest on this debate, can we define the landlord digital PIN, will be helpful for the community of blacks."

And in this presentation, I will be extremely biased I will be presenting the view of the authors of this draft, which is also my Okay? So I will be biased. But, but the goal is not to convince you. That this is the right approach, but the the goal is to have So, there are two different points of view so far. The the one on the left is, the one from a working group adopted draft, which is the digital twin, architectural draft. And the one on the right is, is a different one. Is the one I am offering. Just to make because the the the titles are very long. The one on the left, I will call controller. I'm not I'm not saying that it is simply a controller, but just to use this label and the one on the right I will call it the model So this is the same picture, but a little bit more readable for for the slides. Okay? So, before getting into how each each of these deal work, Let me put a very simple example. Let's say that we want to develop a closed loop in network match. Closed groups are, I, I would say very well known established people understand how they work. Right? And, basically, you can say that they have 3 phases. 1st of all, collect some data from the network, then analyze the data, and then I take a decision and an action up on the network. And then this is the root. Right? And then I run again this as many times as I need I this can be as dynamic as needed. And this can change as often as needed depending on the dynamicity of the So If you didn't have the time to read the drafts, I will say that it is fair to say that The controller draft, which is the working group adopted draft, draft, pretty much defines the network digital twin asked us the analyze decision and action parts. Okay? I will provide that in more details. And the one I'm supporting is that the digital twin is not a controller."

And, actually, this model does not need to run. In a closed loop. This can be offline for planning, it can run-in many different scenarios. I'm just using the closed loop, Scenario? To help defining what both graphs actually. So let me discuss a little bit more the working group adopt that, Drah. So This is how they present the architecture. We're basically on top, you have the applications that are using intent the input intent into the digital twin network, which is this yellow box. It has some boxes inside, which you can check the details on the draft. And then it outputs controlling to the network. And then the network provides data into the digital grid. Okay. Okay. So, Basically, when I look at this picture, what I see is an SDN controller. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

That works within that. It doesn't work with any other, not not normal interface, but but rather it works within that. And it is fundamentally the way I see it is is a controller. The way that this draft defining additional print is similar to when it's being controlled. And I don't understand. I'm, at least, I'm surprised, and I would like to understand why the digital twin style to the intent. So digital twin, which can be understood as a vision or a new technology or a new way to push networks this this draft assumes that it is tight, to intend. Is a big topic by itself. It did its own research topic. And it is not clear how this intent is ingested, related to digital Twin render it into imperative control, which, as I was saying, it's a big topic. Also, it is unclear from this draft how the control signal is generated because at the end, what we're generating is a control signal into a network."

So these are the questions, and, and the arguments I'm putting against the contrary of the of the digital pin. The way I see it is that the digital twin, it's just a model of the network. And by mother, I mean, something that can be understood as a simulator. It does not need to be implemented with a simulator. But the way to think very easily is it's a simulator of It's a box that can tell me what will be the behavior of my network if something happens? And if you think with this very simple definition, you will see that many there are many scenarios that you can fit into this destination. For planning for optimization, for management, So the that is the the network is not pink, It's just a model that it is able to answer just one very simple question. What will be the behavior of my network if this happens? Okay? And with this simple question, you will see that pretty much planning Optimization Management. And so when all these use cases have ported by by this this question. And again, I'm insisting because I think in the last interim meeting, I was not clear enough. It does not need to be implemented with the run network. This can be implemented simulator, emulator, or any other thing. The point is that the role is the goal is to build a model of that I have 3 minutes. Right? For 5 minutes for questions. Yes. Okay. Let me go super quickly with this. So, in the graph, what we have is 22 instances of this model working for network network network first one is more academic. That is the one I'm I was proposing, which is for IP Networks, which is a very dynamic way of seeing a pure network, but it is good for exemplifying how this works. So let's say that let's say that we have a model of IP network, and then we can ask that this is helping. Okay. What will be the impact on the network load if my company acquires company X? Which means that I will have more users, which means that I will have more traffic, So let me know the model, the simulator between brackets,"

Will be the transmission performance for an optical connection, if there are these or that, conditions. And by performance, I guess, that we mean the DVs that you see at the other side of the optical, fiber. You can send more details. That And my last slide that I would like to take the opportunity to present is that it is true, is that, There are very important advances in network modeling recently. And this, has become a hot topic, in the academia. And the reason is that before, Machine Learning, we had one way of modeling network, which was the descriptive and simulator, and a three omelette or there's one from Cisco. All of them, they were pretty much the same. They were, discrete demand simulators that were simulating the net they were very accurate very, very slow. And we didn't have analytical models. And this is very important to understand because if you want to develop an antenna, you have max Maxwell questions. If you want to develop a wing of an aircraft, you have Navi Restock equations. But if you want to develop a network, we don't have analytical model. All half equations. We have queuing theory. It is not very accurate So we there is no equivalent of maxwell. Never let's talk first. So we only have simulation facing, which are very slow. And there are other limitations for simulation. It is happening now, is that there is a bunch of papers Super, on this paper. The papers I'm choosing are publish a total of them in very relevant academic, venues like deep connect, immigrant, or particularly the last one, SCRCAO0. Are building new models of the network using And, actually, the last one, I you can link"

That can compute, which is the traffic and signal propagation of a particular 5 g network it given as an input, the parameters of the cells. Okay? And it was used to optimize hyphenetworks in 5 cities and, well, across many, in many different scenarios. So this is my my my last slide. So I'm requesting the group to to help define cause this debate. So far, there are 2 different points of view. But I'm super happy if there is a third one or, for a different one. So that's pretty much it from my side. Thank you. Thank you for setting time for a question. We have roughly 6 minutes And that question on this topic? Yes. Ron, this is Katie. Just a clarification question on slide 12 Yes. Are the error directions of measurement interface and control correct here. I mean, let's expect that the data flow is the other way around, but Just minor clarification. Oh, you're right. Alright. They're they're they're, in the wrong direction. Yeah. Another common is is that that I I think the model that that you presented is this little bit more generic in the sense that you can also use the model to do some studies on predictions, how things work when you change things as you just fine. Right? So You can also use to predict what happen. What will happen if my traffic double Okay. Yeah. Right. And, I mean, the the event simulators"

And one research question is what kind of needs the network digital twin to have in order to get useful output So if you're, for example, not modeling there into the lien player and the IP layer and have somewhat more abstract flow model, whatever. Then the the performance of the discrete vent simulators could be much better. Right? So depends on what you wanna achieve and what you wanna study with your network digital twin and so So if you do it on the packet level, That's maybe too detailed if you do it on a flow level. Maybe that's fine. I don't know. So the the let me answer your question from a different angle. The first thing is that I agree. If you can model your behavior with an Android simulator. Maybe the digital twin is, simulator. That's fine. Can implement it with a simulator. The thing is that for IP pack, for IP networks, simulation takes, I presented this some some, ITMs ago, but to simulate a a 1 gigabit per second link it will take, a few hours a top or on a very fast compute. Simulations are very slow. And that's why there are people building. Machine Learning models, speed up simulations and to make them faster. And the second thing is that there are other things that are Right? For instance, in optical networks, you you there is no simulation of optical networks, but you could ask for a model on what will happen if I change the amplifier. Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay. Just just one hint. There's new data driven, approach that was presented as, the SICOM. It's a data driven model, called Yeah. Which is more faster.

The other point I wanted to mention was, you try to I like if I try to highlight that, there is a questions raised to the group do we see that, they could be only one answer and that the views are incompatible or that it's, more like. Okay. It's still an, developing field in a joint digital twin. And that's it's a process in fact that we should not try to say, okay, is the definitive definition and the single one that is, let's say agreed but more to to consider that depending on what you want to do with the digital twin, if you want to visualize, if you want to simulate, if you want to the network, there are different I mean, different properties you expect from the digital twin, but they are not necessarily exclusive. They are it could be complementary. Add it, if it depends on the usage that you want to see. So just to like to get your point of view, if we need, I mean, from your point of view, if the group needs to say, okay.

For 5 year network as a, another use cases. Basically, the problem statement, we try to make a concrete some use case for IBM. So even though we published the, advocacy about the IBM concepts and the permissions and intent of the qualification. So we needed to have some concrete use case document. So I believe you can see, we have a unit of following, attempt to make intender based networking. The first one in the framework And second, the data, a modem, between intent and policitor Morales. So in order to do that, we needed to have some intern resonator from intent to a policy. And also to provide the assurance of, intent So we should, use the cross loop control. And finally, we also may be the, NATO or the system for secure intent to provisioning. Those suggestion for our, NMRG So, we got some, information from, other STO, such as a he and IGT. So we can't consider, you can see many, you know, the 5 g network and the IoT virtual. So those kind of use cases. Also, we try to take action on some more concrete to some use cases. So I believe that we can take advantage of, security policy translator."

So, basically, you can see in terms of user, give some, intent and then control returns late. And then adjust to a core network, and let you access the network. And then we can gather using the talk data analytics function, and then we can, utimonic machine learning and then give feedback, and then we can control. This is correlated corridor control, So our The group tried to make a 5 z, you can see this figure so I've been user is that the operator or operator give intent this, IBM controller translate, and report to some, the talk service function database, having some data model mapping information. And then, keep this promise to So that tool, exposure function for, 5 g network. And then, and I have contacts some policy control function and error. And then we can provide some IoT device can't deliver some, sensing data to IT Server. Using some require of the throughput and delay.

The one, challenging one is, we need to provide the intent, the translators. So in order to that, given 2 intent and the policy data model expressed by yamil or Jason or young. Somehow we needed to They are a mapper, and then we're making some mapping information, and then we can use a for a translator. So this figure shows a translator. So the intent given by, IPN user, and then IBM controller has, intended translators. So according to these kinds of steps, disrupt, yeah, explained briefly. Our I-two NSF working group has the concrete 1, and so we have open source projects. We have a working, corridor And then, finally, we also consider some the audit service. So we can use it on the top audit system based on some centralized audit system or decentralized like blockchain So, this draft also describe one simple use case, like IoT device there. Aggregation. So the top left hand side that shows the initialization of the RT device, keeping some sensing policy. It is called application policy. And then, right hand side, it shows some, sensing report.

From a application on the network. What could be a proposition to correlate this different, pieces.

Or if There could be, more like a connection between the use case. I'm picking up, for instance, on the measurement intent. Because, for instance, you in your example, you have a 5 g test bed and you like IoT devices, trying to define, connectivity between them. And the the measurement intent is trying to highlight what could be deployed to get certain types of measurements from the network for a certain purpose. So I don't know if these two work could maybe relate together and make something, as a as an out together.

And as part of the draft, we basically structured the challenges, into these different areas. Basic challenge at the device equipment level, but also at the network level, as a whole, what can we do at the protocol level? As well as the overall architecture basically lists resulting research problems and opportunities in the bidding and the hopefully systemic structure. As as we believe, There've been a number of, updates since the last, IPF in San Francisco. So we posted, an expiration of the draft. We made a number of editorial improvements throughout. We address some comments that are made by the list by Kieran, we gave a clear explanation of some related terms. It was one of the comments that we heard, basically, how does green relate to sustainable greenhouse gas emission versus car carbon footprint and versus energy, etcetera. Etcetera. And we also added some references to related work in IoT who have been dealing for some less constrained devices far for for the violence. So there are potentially lessons also to be applied to the to the larger networks, at large. And, well, essentially, and and now the main question is basically for us is what the next steps are for this drafted document is appears to us as, offers reasonably complete at the at this point. It would certainly would benefit from more more reviews and discussion. And there's a lot of discussion related topics on impact. But not so much here in NMRG, And so the question is how we can, how we can bring some of that into the fall, into the fold. And how we can get also more feedback from NMRG and specifically also the management operational related aspects."

How we can also trigger this this kind of saw one of the, considerations, I guess, always well in the in an IETF working group, basically a way to get, so this thing is the move to last call. I think by I think that process here is not necessarily the same, but I think that there's certainly one one consideration. And that's basically, yeah, what I have on this draft, then there's was also the question that was, raised by the chairs regarding what would be steps potentially beyond this draft. And very concerning the NMG agenda is that, as a whole, but would be some potential topics that we could include for further study here And there are, of course, actually quite a few of those areas, available in the draft itself. For me, actually, a number of items that stand out. And that's, perhaps, also, but subject obviously to interest and feedback from the group here. One aspect is this whole area around visibility and instrumentation. Metrics and frameworks for collecting metrics and so forth. Because, basically, you need to have the visibility in order to, yeah, if we want to minimize, optimize, we need to have that. There is currently a draft on this topic in in opsAWG. Which, however, also still has a number of open ended questions which are a little bit early for sterilization, which would also actually fit a research agenda particularly actually when it comes to metrics that go beyond the device. For instance, if you look at what's the contribution of a flow or of a service instance and then so forth. How do we deal with conversion factor because often we can measure power consumption, but not really greenhouse gas emissions. So there are a lot questions related to that. The second potential area for further, research turns, how we can optimize networks for sustainability. So, basically, given that we, well, assuming that we have all the metrics and support that we need,"

And so what are the algorithms to minimize energy and carbon emissions through network operations And, of course, always under the constraint of meeting service level goals, that's compromising on aspects such as resilience, elasticity network and so forth. And, of course, a lot of the challenges there also from a research perspective is How can we take a holistic perspective that does not Consider the network and network operators only in isolation, but there's a lot context. Right? So what role does compute, place, where do we place, services, what other trade offs sure, Anabat circumstances is it advisable to optimize the minimize network traffic versus spending more effort and carbon and support on good and so forth. So that's a big area, certainly opportunity there. And, just to mention a few more, there's, the issue of intent based network came up in the previous presentation, and I think is a topic also for the group here. So clearly, basically, green intent or sustainable intent and control maps that you can operate on to navigate also the the trade offs between other operation goals that is certainly I think also, yeah, potential area for for further work. And then finally, perhaps to mention carbon accounting and incentive schemes, aspects that have to deal deal with also basically providing incentives to users and so forth, how they use networks. That's about those. I'll certainly also topics which are speculative at this point, so worth exploring from a research perspective. Maybe one, I'm as, as one consideration, perhaps tease out some of that. It would be useful to have perhaps also an MRG, maybe some joint and MRG and E impact workshop on on on such a topic or so."

Don't have this kind of, let's say, formal, let's go as we are in working group, but Yeah. So this is ready to pretty make progress for this draft. If you think, as a mature enough, So there'll be a set of mail, sent regarding that. Although I think it's important because, as, as you know, as I mentioned, in the group, there is a part about this green networking which might be part of the research and then the future.

My name is Ron Bliss. I want to talk about Kira, which is a scalable 0 touch routing architecture for autonomous control planes. So in the in MRG context, this fits very well to the, the first topic as safe driving or safe managing networks. And Kira actually provides an important foundation for that. The the the goal was to provide a resilient control plane connectivity that you need for all the fancy stuff that we wanna do in network management. So especially also topics discussed tier like AI based control, intent based network management, and on. So you can do all fancy stuff in whatever higher layers, but if you are not able to get down to the devices anymore, and then it's quite useless. So especially also important is to avoid any Circular dependencies. So if you're, you always need whatever monitoring in order to control the network and the the basic connectivity also depends on that. Then that may be problematic from a resilient for reliability point of view. And so We have various ways of doing the control, like, inbound control or band, and also hybrid. Versions, due to the complexity and and"

So given the dynamics of modern networks, So you found that existing solutions are not that scalable. Or a 0 touch or if they scalable and 0 touch that. Sometimes, topology is specific like rift, for example, So Kira could be also be used as alternative to the currently considered routing protocol and the Anima as autonomous control plane, which is currently Ripple ACP, Since Kira also offers a built in DHT, I will to you more about that later. It could also be based for a a 6gcoreinfrastructure. So what we already did is, put, for example, open 5 gs on top of Kira. And so we had 5 core infrastructure, automatically organized by itself without any configuration. So that was demonstrated at last week. So features of Kira, when I say this is scalable. 0 touch. What means scalable? Can connect 100,000 of the notes. It is ID based. So it uses node IDs, as flat addresses. It doesn't use any locators. So we also have no mapping system from IDs to locators. The trade off that we get is basically we you always have some scratch to some of the destinations. One that is first tunable, and we also have shortest path to contact in our routing table, in case you're a controller basically want to put let's say the thousand devices that you control there's so many. Into your routing table and then you get very efficient routes. But to our all other notes, you're still are able to connect to or send messages to"

Ipv6 connectivity, just without configuration, it is fully safe, organizing since it uses self assigned addresses, And so there are no further dependencies. We found that it works well and across various topologies, so be it sparse or dense, like datacenters, And it's also using path based forwarding So we can easily support backup path and also multi path routing. There's a first internet draft, which is not yet complete, but an update will follow soon. We also have running code as just mentioned. Which is going to be released soon We have to do some cleanup, but once they're done in a few weeks, I guess We will release that code. So we have code for the large scale simulations in order to show that it is scalable. You have an SDN based. Prototype type, which is a little bit slower in the control plan. So to on the writing protocol and serve. Is not that that fast, in Python, but the forwarding tier can forward and tend to give it per second, whatever you currently, you are working on a native frauding daemon for Linux. Using only NF tables. So we don't need any SDN switch all the forwarding tier. And it's written in rusts. So the architecture roughly looks like this, we have a routing tier, with the routing protocol, that uses source routing for its own messages, which makes it quite reliable. And we have a forwarding tiers So all the control plane traffic that you forward is using a fast path. So to say, basically using normal forwarding parameters like longest prefix match and so on."

That's basically on the normal longest prefix match and also some kind of encapsulation, GSE tunneling similar a little bit to label switch. Could be you use other could be used also other techniques like segment routing, but that's for for a study. So the control plane would normally simply only see ipv6 as connectivity. So we can just use your control plane apps directly over ipv6 as we've also demonstrated for home 5 gs, for example, So no adaptations necessary there, so it just can, can use your normal network management Applications. We also support and that's also kind of interesting, additional services like topology Discover So we defined a topology discovery mechanism that uses features of our protocol. So you, for example, you only have to ask 4% of all the notes and get the full topology out of that. So which is kind of nice. If you want to make service placement, what have you, It's a very lightweight way of discovering the topology. So for example, if you want to do any kind of hierarchical, stuff or define areas. You first discover the topology and then maybe automatically cluster your network into certain areas or so. So that's also more in a to support more self management. Second thing that I already mentioned is that we have more or less a distributed hash table on board, which is a very simple key value store, and that kept used for for naming. Since the the note IDs are typically randomly generated, you don't can't, you know, cannot really work"

But you cannot use it also for service registration and look up services covering. And so What we recently did is also to introduce domain scopes normally, you have a global scope in the sense that all nodes in the key run network can just, reached can be reached or reach each other. And for if if you wanna use it for, let's say, control in a certain autonomous system, you wanna make sure that the routes inside your own autonomous system doesn't depend on any other autonomous system, which could be the case with the global variant of Kira. So some provider autonomous system could rely on another node and whatever Australia. To be present and working in order to to control their own devices in order to avoid that, keep we we are able now to keep the communication local. Here in that example, if you have some kind of domain J, You can make sure that the communication stays inside the domain and does not use the, for example, the domain, above We also support some kind of more lightweight way system mode. So in case you have many end systems to manage, you can also do that. They are not part of the routing system, but they can use their ID based addressing we support multipath routing. And what we are currently looking at is also security measures. That you can add. So why am I here? So first to make you aware of the approach or solution that we have to get feedback, to get support, to get more ideas, especially on use cases, For example, if you wanna transport telemetry data for AI, Would it be useful to do it"

It could be edits. Yeah. And that's basically the end of my presentation. Any questions? Do have a question. You are a bit highlighting different, let's say, properties, specifically to Kira in terms of, which shopping, scalability, etcetera. One question I have is about the, for instance, maybe if you can show the slide with the, the different domains the logical domains that, you know, this one. Have you already investigated the case you obviously, like, some some area islands that get disconnected from, from connectivity and rejoin, nodes or areas. And if your approach is in fact providing any convergence or, Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So so, yeah, we we we looked at network, but session, and then, then rejoining that is basically very easily possible. Indeed. So, so you will soon in case in the network splits. The each network will have its own connectivity, which still available.

I think a better, interest introduction So I wonder what is the, main difference from your, the network architecture from traditional software defined, the network looks like you have some louding tier, porting tier, also some control some friend, something like that. So Could you, yeah, explain the differences or some similarity between your architectural SDN. Okay. I see. I see. This is a fully distributed solution. It just it just provides the connectivity you typically you would use SDN on top of that. So the idea is, for example, that we provide the connectivity from the controller to all the switches. In band, for example, could also be out of band, but but the basic or the original motivation was with, in an inbound fashion, in a very reliable fashion, so that you could even have dynamic controllers popping up being able to find each other state synchronization, what have you, and then also to to control different set of controllers. So We have no central routing decision also. The routing tier is is really adjust the distributed routing protocol which puts, calculates the routes and pushes them then through the forwarding This is not for data plan routing. So the idea is that this gives you connectivity for the control plane or management plane. And the the data plane routing would be different thing. Could be done by SDN or any other distributed solution. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. We have other questions. Okay. So just not thank you very much for the presentation."
