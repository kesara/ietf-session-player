    "text": "my question is are you doing any sort of longitudinal measurements are you seeing any trends here any periodicity is there is this changing over time are you planning on continuing measurements to gain that now knowledge we\u0027ve been seeding the DNS with unique DNS names for seven years now and we see seven year old queries because the timestamp is inside the DNS name so you know there are just old queries out there I always think the DNS is actually like long term storage that all you need to do is encode what you want inside a query and to sit there and listen and sooner or later you\u0027re gonna get re query and that\u0027s your read function I don\u0027t know it\u0027s getting worse or better but certainly our perspective is we seed more names in our repeat rate you know the ghost rate just keeps on inexorably growing at some point we\u0027re going to have to walk away from the top-level names that we\u0027re using because they\u0027re so polluted the signal is getting lost inside the repeat noise we know what we\u0027re doing because the names have meaning but your server which have been running for years which has a whole bunch of gross queries and you\u0027re seeing a thousand queries a minute is that nine hundred and ninety shit and one real how do you know no one does the suspicion is that you are overwhelmed with your legacy and that real queries are actually extremely low but they\u0027re masked out by this extraordinary property of the DNS to just simply memorize a repeat and recycle quantifying that difficult that it certainly seems bad one question that occurred to me as I was looking at your your analysis is is there the potential that some of this is malware traffic that\u0027s using you know DNS queries as some way of probing the state of the network reach ability we see a lot of log re players so there is a massive business out there of capturing and then replaying and generally they are relatively benign but we also see a whole bunch of other things where pathologies that are inexplicable there was a DNS resolver in Jordan and other one in Guatemala doing up to 20,000 queries per second for days of the same name it\u0027s kind of I\u0027m sorry what exactly is going on here guys you know so the combination is just an amazing pool of awfulness we\u0027ve exhausted the line thank you very much thank you see you in Vancouver and also the slide where "
