So we have 3 scribes, Thomas Kalia and Christina. Thank you. For doing that. Okay. Pretty full agenda. But first, a few housekeeping notes you've seen those slides already from like yesterday. And also for those who attended the hackathon, you've seen it on Saturday Sunday as well. The note well statement so that our processes were documented. They're a bunch of published RFCs that describe, like, the process, the working groups, like, patterns and participation and so on. The nutshell, since you've seen this already before, be civilized in discussions. Appreciate that other participants have different views, You don't need to agree with them, but be friendly to each other. That's what the note we're saying, and, of course, this, more important"

European unions attempt to build, a digital identity wallet has kind of a a couple of, actually, 4 work styles and for somebody with a US background. Like, one of the, like, key things to understand about the you is that the EU is not re it's not actually a political process as much as a deal making negotiation process. So what this is basically is a 30 way negotiation between all of the member states and the European Commission around sort of how do we actually make something that we could use as a digital identity I'm involved in something called the Lodgegate pilot. Which is an attempt to actually look at use cases and there is a legislative process that is designed to produce something called implementation acts. Now The TLDR version here is that implementation acts are technical specifications masquerading as law. Or lower masquerading as technical specifications. In the EU, stuff that goes into implementation acts. Have to be based on standards published by either ISO or Etsy. That's that's the law. Doesn't mean that ISO and Etsy have to write all of the specs."

Actual technical and semantic interoperability between the between 30 member states. And some operational use cases. Now, the interesting bits here is that like, initially, It was taught that in person third party flows, things like presenting your driver's license to a police officer, a digital driver's license on your phone to a police officer physically maybe at, a DUI check. Would be like one of the major drivers for this. It turns out the member states actually want to look at web based use cases. Which means that there is a There are kind of 2 work strands going on. 1 there's a lot of focus on the in person flows and one where there's a lot of focus on the web flows and though the web flows we're looking at the the standards we actually want to use there. Are things, that you probably have heard of things like open ID for VCI have open ID for VP. But there is a there are some gaps there.

And maybe the the need that we can see him the UDI wanted process is that there are issues around cranial security and privacy that need to be worked And that's where the, like, the main least, if you ask us, that's where the main focus of this work should be. There's certainly no time to duplicate any work going on in other standouts organizations like the OpenID Foundation like full confidence that that is getting done. We need stuff that Etsy can reference so that Etsy doesn't have to go and rewrite stuff. Basically. That's the that's the pump. That's the ask. That that I'm tried to convey.

They all follow a similar pattern The worker is providing an assertion from a one forklifts about their forklift certification to a construction company. For each of these, there is an unspoken, you know, so that so that this person can work. The so that is my opinion, outside the scope of what we want this work to this work group to do. What we need is the technology, to do it. Each of these assertions is provided to an individual or a company or some entity. And then shared with any number of other entities. Signed and secured and ideally privacy preserving. Next slide, please. So each of these follows a very similar pattern. Some holder is providing an assertion from a from an issuer about some subject to a verifier. Sometimes this flow is called the 3 party model. But it's slightly different from from other flows that have been designed and developed elsewhere in that there is this third party. There's this holder that serves kind of as a cash for the information about the subject that's been issued by the issuer. These assertions are, we call them credentials.

Well, the point I was trying to emphasize here is the whole street party model really heavily relies on asymmetric on cryptography. So there are potentially 3 key pairs that are being involved. So left hand side is issuance right hand side of this presentation that usually happens asynchronously, And on the left hand side, so I should have put, numbers, but essentially the bottom wallet providing control over the public key a. That's kind of the first step. The user has to prove control of a certain key. I call it keep their a. And then isher after it verifies science over that key, that's what I denoted as you know, keep their b, and they would get the credential. The piece of data that the user claims. Right? And on the right hand side, I'm we have So again, I'm sorry I forgot to put in errors, but essentially the bottom error is the the first one.

It again, EU is driving force here and also, machine identity like Salt Lake supply chains. And why we're talking about this? So if we can go to the next slide, How do you find this key pairs is the question? Right? So for the issuers and verifier's key pair, like, those are usually big organizations. It's, like, legal person. Right? So we can use with all x 5 or 9. The ill known endpoint, there's some options to use decentralized identifiers, maybe something else. For the users, it's a bit harder because we don't really, I guess, expect, every single user to have an 5 or 9, or every single user having a resolvable endpoint that each user hosts. So usually the options are for natural persons, right? Options are using row public key, Jada Bicki. Some print, you realize it's an RSC on it. Again, decent residentifiers, maybe something else.

One other sort of comment just among background that I would give is, as Lafe mentioned, there are sort of many different use cases for these technologies, not just for, you know, natural you know, persons doing in person physical presentation, but also for organizations exchanging business documents to facilitate trade deals Global Commerce, etcetera. That's actually my interest in this area is in the context of securing, physic cyber physical supply chains. International Trade Relations issues with customs and imports. And in those documents, the data structures associated with the assertions can very quickly become large So one of the things that I'm very interested in is concise representations of some of the same structures we've seen evolving in the OAuth working group. So One of those is selective disclosure within, seaborne, but it follows some of the structures that we've seen for selective disclosure in Jason. With that background, gonna kind of describe a high level, flow. And so now that you know this issuer holder and verifier roles, let's say you have an issue or has some claims about a subject, perhaps the subject's name and their date of birth This first arrow is issuance. The subject, receives a credential contains their subject identifier their name, their date of birth. Could be their name and their date of birth could be their child's name, their child's date of birth. The holder is not always the subject of the credential.

And of course, as a data subject and possibly a data controller, I don't want to give out information about myself. If it's not in support of some activity that's of benefit to me. One of the valuable features of selected disclosure is revealing with integrity protection, one assertion and not revealing others. So here you can see the name has been redacted. But the date of birth is still presented. Next slide. As I said before, the main property that we're looking for here is integrity protection over the data. But with the ability to support data minimization. The traditional signature schemes you usually have to reveal the entire content of the payload that was secured. With selective disclosure, you can reveal parts of the payload. That have been secured and still prove that they have not been tampered with since the issuer committed to those values. And as I said, it can prevent this process of oversharing And with this building block, we can build better experience safer experiences into these digital credential flows I think it's a really, really important part of enabling this, this property is that Brent mentioned at the beginning if we go at this problem without thinking about data minimize, minimization, about privacy and confidentiality.

So, sort of similar to, the slide that Christina was giving, comparing some of these identifier schemes. I wanna just describe some of the benefits of doing selective disclosure in cozy. As opposed to selective disclosure and So, you know, one of the benefits of working in cozy is, binary, doesn't have to be text encoded So we can get these really compact document formats And that's, a benefit, especially when you have nested structures where you have, binary identifiers and you know, you're you're keeping your document size smaller. One of the benefits I think that in this personal opinion on cozy, One of the things I really like about it is that it has a familiar familiar familiarity to the Jose development experience. So I, I learned web development. I used cozy? Are you built OAuth systems, And then later, as I wanted some of these compact, concise properties, I started to use use cozy for things. And that transition was easy for me as a developer because of some of the familiarity. There's other places where there wasn't a direct analogy or maybe cozy had invented something that posy didn't have, But this the synergy and alignment between Jose and Cozy is property that I believe, believe, believe, believe, is very valuable, and it's part of why I contribute to both working groups at the IETF. Some of the challenges around cozy though, just be aware. If you're trying to apply seabornecozy to digital credential formats, the tooling and maturity ecosystem can be a little bit difficult to, to get started with, I'd highly recommend if you're interested in this. You focus on diagnostic notation, CDDL, learn the the basic visual tools that we'll shorten your iteration and learning process as you adopt them."

So, you know, potentially you're going to be working in a language that doesn't have great binary support, although maybe don't use that language. Next slide. I wanted to give you kind of visual, understanding of this selective disclosure structure. And this SDCWT proposal mirrors the SD JWT proposal, which is, adopted work item within the OAuth working group, and it's been progressing fabulously there. So that structure that you're gonna see here is kind of a cozy take on that same approach. And there's some challenges that Hosey has in in communicating these disclosures that Cozy doesn't have because Cozy has this under the header that's built into the fundamental data structure. Here in this envelope format, you see the protected header It's blue. The unprotected header is this red box. The payload with disclosable values. And the signature. And as you can see, the the discloseable values in the payload and the disclosed value in the unprotected header. The coloring there is to make your brain think about switching them. And that's exactly how selective disclosure in these structures works. So, I could remove values from the unprotected header to redact them from the disclosure. Where I could add them back to the unprotected header to include them in a presentation. And that simple process of sort of adding or removing things can be integrity protected And it's, it's, pretty pretty simple to implement.

So, let's say you're presenting a, to a document that is in a supply chain context and it's related to an upstream or downstream supplier. And as part of this business negotiation, you have a document from 1 of your, vendors.

And if one of those components has a problem in it. How do you identify where all all the places that I might need to go to fix that problem. So software built materials is kind of a manifest of all of the dependencies that went into a software product. And it could get very, very large no.

An unknown Cve, and you could build that artifact and deploy it and then 3 seconds later be notified, but it's already out the door. How do you communicate to your, your customers, your, your upstream or downstream software supply chain parties. What's going on with the the software product that you've just made based on the latest information that you have. So the software build materials is basically, as I said, it's a manifest And so within that manifest, I might reveal certain parts of the data structure on the left hand side, you can seed and overall envelope as a cozy sign 1. With a protected header at the top, and, the rest of the envelope underneath And you can see that there's disclosures the unprotected header. So this is the concrete example from the previous slide. And then in a payload, you can see that the payload is this sort of JSON looking data structure but it has these places where there's a disclosable value that could be substituted in. Next slide. Oh, So there was emojis in here. And, they were beautifully colored, And they've been go back. Sorry. The the colors are gone, so it's gonna be very hard for me to communicate where the substitutions happened. But I'm still gonna try.

And that's what allows me to reveal that I had a shell script in the directory when I ran this. And that's important security information for the software build materials. What happens if the hash on that shell script changes? Is that okay? Maybe. Right? So this is what software bills of materials supposed to help us with to look at Whether our software artifacts have been tampered with, to see the ingredients that went into producing them And when combined with selective disclosure, I could reveal to you with integrity protection that these files were in this directory and their hashes were these values. But I can omit other information about which files may have been adjacent to them that are maybe not relevant to you. Now that's degrading some of the transparency property. That could be an important part of flying with the legal processes that my business has. Or for other reasons I might choose not to disclose the full software of build materials.

That's okay. Next. So one privacy property is minimal disclosure. Only releasing the information that you need for an interaction. Rather than per my counter example, just releasing everything to everybody. This could be accomplished in a number of different ways. Using open ID connect You can have the relying party use the claims request and request tokens with only the claims that you need. Or in the 3 party model, a verifier can ask a wallet for a presentation. With only the needed claims and the wallet issues set. Both of these are forms of selective disclosure.

There's work in the CFRG here on that. There's work in the Jose working group. On JWP and single use credential So we are working on enabling this using standards. Next, There's not just one kind of non correlation. You can think about preventing correlation among many different kinds of parties. I know there's been some discussions on some of the mailing lists about trying to, for instance, prevent correlation among issuers and verifiers such that even the issuer can't tell that the presentation that you received corresponds to a verifiable credential that it issued.

And it's I don't think we have protocols for doing that, but I wanted to give you, you know, a bigger sense of the possible space of privacy. Next. Tracking. I've already talked about this a little bit. It's the ability for a party to observe and record your actions. So Open ID connect providers. Can track which RPs you use and what claims e released to them. Sammel can do this too."

One possibility is rather than releasing data about you as full claims. So for instance, my twin daughter's birth date is on this slide. It is possible not only to release their birth date, but there are systems. Where you could Instead, release a proof that their birth date is over the age of eighteen. Without revealing their birth date in 1994. And this is indeed enabled by technologies called 0 knowledge proofs. Again, some of the CFRG and BBS work is enabling this next. With that, I'll stop.

Roman. Hi, Remindinilu as an as an individual. I This is a question for Ori based on the presentations. So I observe that many times when we do something in JSON, we wanna do it in seaborne. There's this pow cross pollination between the JWT and the CWT community. I saw one of the markers you had out there is that things are different in seabor. And as we talk about the ongoing work where we have with selective disclosure in the in a JSON kind of encoding, why is that more complicated in a seaborne coating in, why couldn't we just have a common CD that that that that that generates both. Hi, Boris Steele. I'm so glad you asked question. It's my favorite question. So in in Jason, we have this, need to sort of harden the data structure before we provide cryptography around it. We use base 64. URL encoding, We use JSON serialization, the unit code encoding, details matter in in those worlds. And so when you create a strengths of building on top of Jason Webb Tokens or Jason Webb signatures you encounter the limits of the media type"

Where do you put the disclosures? So an SD Jot there's sort of 2 answers to that question that are Jason and Jose specific. One place is to append them to this string. With Tilda characters. It's the last remaining control character we have. Another place would be to use detected header sort of block that's only available to the JSON serialization. And now mirrors the cozy. Structure, but It's not available in all of the places you might want it to be. So while Jose and Cozy are typically very strongly aligned, there are these cases where One has, features that the other one doesn't and you really wish it did. And sometimes the opposite of that. And so it can be important to when you're trying to maintain picture alignment, so that you can have, upgradeability preserving the same security and privacy properties as you give of you know, smaller payloads, energy saving, less storage to your users it it it's helpful to have that architectural alignment while still having the same capabilities in both places. I hope that answers the question. Okay. Good. Hank.

And the industry really is kinda like breathing down our neck years at some point. So, I think the most important part that hasn't been discussed yet or hasn't been said yet, then the charter is that the protocol that that kinda create those micro credentials that create the statement that you are just, older than 18 and then, okay, to drive the car or to cross that water or whatever. These protocols are transformed that out of scope at the moment. What we ideally wish to have is the protocols would be like independent, of the representation of those statements that we create here. I think that might be to some extent visual thinking, but I think it's a it's a achievable goal when we define that well. And that is what the charter is about. So next items in the charter is the milestones and they're they're pretty obvious, I think. They're just repeating what everybody just said So we will have a binding document that explains the whole setup. There were a lot diagrams here. Right? Explaining how how an incapability works, which which roles are there. Maybe there's a fall through on the internet. We heard about mediators.

Some countries require that this this disclosure. So there's tons of applicability here in a global standard. And I think it's it's really interesting international interactivity. So when I go to an airport, And and there's of of course, often this is passport, analogy that my my country gives me this passport, and I'm I'm going from there.

The extensibility here is that you need more characteristics sometimes. Intake of claims. In in in the form of what a unprotected header, algorithm you require to to put it to undisclose it or close it. So there are multiple ways to do that. So that is something that you have to then, then there's regulation of cryptography, apparently. So you can't go somewhere and disclose somewhere with the algorithm that you are not allowed to use. And and so that's the I'm just making this. This is just from the top of my head. So so there are extensibility points here. That would enable the global use Okay. R think thanks for the comment.

Using confidential computing, to you know, as as you guys know, confidential computing enables very Fibril software. On verifiable hardware, infrastructure. And so what we have stumbled into is fact that we can actually develop software agents that are personal, and that can be cryptographically bound to individual entities. If you introduce the concept of a confidential privacy preserving personal software agents acting on behalf of an entity. The problem space collapses. Because you can have agents that talk to one another do the presentation, the verification, in the exchange of data, in a way that is in fact completely in invisible to humans. So you keep that in the information space that is completely shielded protected and encrypted. Away from humans. So, very interested in participating in this group.

I think you reached an important point because some of you who had been working in this space a little longer know that these efforts have been tried before, but now I think we have technology in our hands, that enables some of those use cases like these wallets with some of these trusted execution environments and other hardware technologies that allow us to store these credentials more securely and and so on and so on attestation and all this other good stuff.

You can do disclosure of, presentation disclosure, the tables, to get referred to to to start it and to convince someone else. That the presentation happened.

To the point on privacy pass, One of the things I think that really as I prepared slides regarding, you know, unlinkability as I start to consider how IETF has has tackled this particular challenge. Privacy pass really was missing from from a lot of the discussion especially within the OAuth, framing around unlinkability. And as I compare the description of unlinkability within OAF documents to the descriptions of unlinkability as a property within privacy pass, I find really good pieces in both, but but but but sometimes really strong alignment and sometimes, different pieces and in the context of especially I said, non natural person identity, bot identity, machine identity, some of these unlinkability characteristics that privacy pass has been of looking at are really, really interesting.

So I still don't know what is the identity work that we're doing. So back to the idea with the the CWT stuff. Right. I mean, we have flexibility. We're providing for container that can be used for a lot of different things. As I read the charter text, I actually heard we're not there's a specific section that says We're not doing kind of protocol work. So I was confused as to, like, the key discovery piece that felt like protocol work that So we we key it up, but it doesn't appear to be in scope and it explicitly says it's out of scope. I was also confused as to the checkout criteria we're gonna have that we know in a sense we're done. I heard motivating use cases around individual identities, if there's some things that said they were out of scope, I heard things around supply chain stuff that we also said is atoscope. And it doesn't even seem unpack unpacked at all in what is, a sense, identity documents and then we create design criteria that I don't know how we achieve Like, I don't know what the measure of a semantic interchangeability is or how we'll measure usability feasibility, which we put as 1st order design principles with kinda security properties.

As one of the SD charts, we see authors and assuming there will be a significant overlap between spies in all of experts, I could imagine that the work on STP short, we see is happening in Spice at some point. But it should, definitely close the line with I I guess we'll have some discussions on that later. So the reason is that I see a lot of conceptual overlap between he mentioned, CWT identity documents and the SD chart we see work, which already adopted by the war section group after ATF San Francisco. For instance, SD chart is the defines an SD chart based an entity document format. It also contains a way to do issued covery, and validation using different technologies such as this. It's X Five Nine chart issue metadata. It would be good to align as much as possible, I don't agree that presentation not be approach, but it should be a priority as other calls and other organizations. I guess, it was also what Christina mentioned earlier. But I think that some pop calls, such as the issue of PSCRA thing. But in general, I'm supportive of having a working group obese stuff. Thanks.

Of course, there's a significant overlap, but, making sure that the semantics are aligned even if the actual serialization and encoding, differs, of course, between JSON and and, seabor, but I think, that that would be, would be key because, people simplify the understanding as or he put it for the developer if they have seen the same terminology, same semantics, So that would be a big plus Okay.

It it's good that we're considering things like selective disclosure and and on likability, certainly the privacy properties could be even worse without those things. But like, I I I I am scared that that maybe we're only thinking about those privacy and property the the presenter earlier asked if if there were any others, certainly, we could come up with many more. Right? Some things we might wanna consider are things like transparency, control accountability.

That is a thing I'm very concerned about here. We're all technologists. We love the technology. The cautious about, you know, a world where this was rolled out everywhere I also think, that's a place where the IAB and other IITF, sort of organs are probably better positioned help us engage with, communities that can best address those kinds of concerns. So, basically plus one to many of your comments. Well, plus 2 then. And Nick, I'd love to talk with you. I I've I've missed the name, but So many with Hashmesh, I wanna again suggest that we think in terms of introducing a confidential personal agent in the mix, because the minute you do that, you can actually have a verifiable piece of software that can a test to what it's doing. Which gives the transparency, the provenance, the accountability, the anonymity when needed, there's all kinds of issues that get resolved and and the problems space collapses. So we should very much look into that. Instead of, focusing on short term you know, formats and things like that.

What is out of scope, And I also, just for the context, I work on this for a lot of residential stuff across ISO IETF that was received, maybe foundation, if whatnot, So I would claim to have some kind of understanding where the gaps are. I think one thing, so nothing linked data, RDF is in scope. That's absolutely out of scope. Another thing is it has to be defined probably better, but take focus on the 3 party model, I guess, definition could be asynchronous, issuance, and presentation. And also I would like to claim that give a better step, I think, late to the good job clarifying, but giving a stop at differentiating transport protocols from credential formats. We say credential formats, I think we mean this a piece of a data model, like a piece of data that is short is a testing about an entity that so it includes definition of a data model, maybe a schema, and how that thing is is signed, right, and how the keys to verify diet or discover does not always in scope. So I think that's why we kinda You know? Earlier presentation today. We're kinda trying to separate those 2. And transfer protocol is more about who I am, who's question, you know, with the messages, I'm what are the requirements for things that fulfill the request, how may returning it, whatnot, including query languages, and Again, a transport product, defining a new transport protocol should be out of scope.

And also back to quickly to Nick's point, I'm Getting this 3 party model that was very hard. Getting it right is very hard. Like, we've been working on this building it for 6 years and You know, like, it's it's it's not gonna be perfect, and they next few years, like, I I I personally think, but We should be careful in differentiating how much technology can do to, like, privacy sec privacy security What was it, accountability perspectives? Because a lot of it is regulations. And, like, requirements from from that, right, I'm, and being it's not just a gal. Like, I don't wanna So I'm controversial, but as much as privacy is really important. If we will wait for you know, execute, Pete, the modes, the best ZKP algorithm be ready to deploy the scale, like, this will never come to life. So I would encourage all of us to while obviously caring about those aspects. To be really careful about the balance.

We're not, like, we're not we're we're not any work hosted up. Right?

So I think that's true. But I think that the regulatory regimes can only make use of the mechanisms that are available to them. And if we design a presentation protocol, that does not have hooks for accountability. Then the regulators don't have much to work with. So we have an obligation as we work here to design systems that provide opportunities for accountability Specifically, my concern is the the the folks who have the least power in the system are likely to be the holders. And so we need to make sure that these systems that we design have accountability for the verifiers and accountability for issuers. We learned this the hard way, with certificate transparency."

No roaming we could already do this in existing working groups. I felt like we were talking about something, you know, emergent, something kind of newer that we needed to manage and kind of think about differently in a working group.

Are we all thinking the same thing? And we have have we crisply written it up to describe what what is that? I don't think we have that.

So we have a we have a signal that there's interest kinda work on that, Rommel, but we have to refine it more. So between now and some kind of future date. What we'll do is we'll come back to the mailing list We have a starting piece of charter text. We should probably refined that, get more feedback on it. I did not see a diverse set of feedback.
