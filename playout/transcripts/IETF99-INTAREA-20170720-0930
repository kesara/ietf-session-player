    "text": "so what what I\u0027ve said up to this point applies to the first connection attempt in further connection attempts the Sox client can attempt to do zero RTT authentication which case the server replies with an authentication reply and and requests that no further action be taken so next slide so let\u0027s take a also look at what the request looks like we\u0027ve got version numbers made a major number and a minor number we\u0027ve got we advertise the known north in ossification methods we tell the proxy whether we want to use here for or not we tell it whatsoever to connect to we also include some options in TLB format and also and at the end we place some initial application data the next slide the authentication reply is your authentication reply it basically tells the client whether the proxy needs further authentication or not so in case zeroeth an RTT authentication failed or was not attempted the server basically the proxy basically tells the client that such-and-such method must be followed in order to authenticate the client in case your Artie authentication succeeded the server tells the client via which authentication method it actually authenticated the client next slide please and finally we\u0027ve got the operation reply which tells the server which tells the client whether the connection was successful or not case it wasn\u0027t successful it informed the client whether it was due to a reset or because the connection timed out or because the proxy did not did not refuse to connect to that server because of policies or whatever other reason I feel that that is a new field feel that is of particular importance here is the initial data offset this field actually gives the server a kind of carte blanche as to how much of the initial data it is supposed to buffer while waiting for the client to authenticate so basically if the client sends a huge chunk of initial data the the server can choose not to open up to buffer it while while waiting while waiting for the client to attend you can just feel that you can just feel the initial data offset field with zero forcing the client we transmit the data now let\u0027s look at how Sox six typically operates in practice this is this is how we "

    "text": "expect the data exchange to look like on the wire assuming that assuming that nothing really weird happens and that the practice that the client and the proxy server are implemented efficiently so the client starts by size by initiating a three-way handshake with us with a server with a proxy after one proxy after one client to proxy RTT it sends the request along with some initial data for the server this is when the proxy initiates a three-way handshake with the server as soon as that three-way handshake is completed it sends over the the initial application data the server then replies so the total time taken to for the client to receive data reply from the server is to RT T\u0027s which is no worse than vanilla TCP next slide please so let\u0027s see what happens if we\u0027ve got TFO on the proxy on the client proxy leg in this case we actually we get to shave off one proxy that one client to proxy RTT in case the proxy is on path this we in case the proxies on path we have some we have negative overhead so we get a data reply and one and two and Artie T plus one proxy two server Artie T this is especially advantageous in case of mobile deployments because the delay at layer at at layer two is it tends to be high so next slide please so in case we have air for on all legs thus the the initial the initials in hopefully contains both the request and all of the data that the server needs in order to generate the response the proxy server does something which could which is roughly equivalent to stripping stripping the request it sends and it sends the the application data to the server the server replies and the proxy and the proxy relays that they touch with the server in this case we get the data apply in one RTT this is exactly what we would expect from TFO so we do have one early prototype based on shadow Sox some of you might be familiar with it it\u0027s available at the link on this slide we are we have also written a message library which you can use to write your own clients and servers and that\u0027s it for me thank you "
