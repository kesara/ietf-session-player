    "text": "two ways to classical ways of doing this the first one is the fabric captures a very very precise off when the device is seen and then compare us you know is our multiple places where the device has been seen recently compares the most recent finds the most recent timestamp the prime with that approach is that the mobility of the device can be very slow or very fast and the amount of space and the precision of the timespan of the time stamp can vary a lot so it\u0027s very hard in a UT situation to find the right unit for a timestamp and the right precision of the timer and exposed that so what ripple does and what now 6lowpan ng we\u0027ll be doing with this change is that the source keeps a sequence so that\u0027s the AO t v--\u0027s destination sequence number if you like that\u0027s that\u0027s a number that the IOT device the 6ln has to maintain because the routing will need it to figure out the most recent location so now when this new work that we are doing here repair in our lives acts on behalf of this device it will have a sequence number which will allow to find the freshest location of the device in the network and set the routing appropriately so that\u0027s a big chance we made in six the patent and either otherwise I will show you second thing we are changing in 6lowpan and E is source address validation there are two aspects in Savi so first aspect years when somebody forms an address if is the first in the network it should hone that address that\u0027s handy but the question is can somebody steal that address with the current and if loose that\u0027s very easy you just exposed the same address now you get the traffic so on on powerful devices the IDF has defined CGI AMC and which RFC Sutton and 71 22 and that enables to protect the address against theft but it\u0027s a very complex protocol it\u0027s mostly and implemented nobody\u0027s implemented but Cisco I guess and the last third document in this in this description is the backbone router if you take six up and indeed the first document and the backbone router what you get really is the lay of three equivalent of dots 11 a total 11 Association meaning if you figure out what really dot 11 does with with an association on wires when you\u0027re looking up somebody you just send a broadcast about spending 3 while the old fabrics right you send a broadcast of spanning tree and that that feels the transparent bridging state the source of this broadcast we know areas along the spanning tree now that\u0027s ok on wires that was never okay on radios so what the wife Ida did when they developed the radios in this a a we cannot have of all these spanning tree transplant bridging flooded over my radio so what I\u0027m gonna "
