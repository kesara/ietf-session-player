But at the time that these research group is man, we moved the draft to the in the independent banana team editor talk. Right? So the the dove becomes eight five ninety seven.

So here, you can see the the representation of their detectors how we divide the control responsibilities in which regards to the service and with regards to the to the transport part.

Also creating considering that resource playing control this environment. And the second point is that more and more the are artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities in order to perform this closed loop automation management looks. Right? So the the point was to do this Am expansion of the architecture considering these two different dimensions. Next slide, please. So then we well... Oh, okay. Here that the call probably not very So essentially what we create was what first we renamed the transport start was the the previous name by the connectivity starting just for reflecting better what I about be aim. What what we call in the past essentially working within a working part, the connectivity part of architectural framework. Then we added this computer started for reflecting the direction of the management control capabilities for the compute side. And then for each of the planes, we added the learning plate for each of the starter. Sorry. We have the the running plan with the idea of these plans to work with yeah. The the and the the the the of the data of each of the particular est.

So we today we bring a dropped called generic coin framework in control environment. So next slide, please. The past five to ten years, we have seen a lot of research on programmable network. So programmable network devices actually have really inspired a lot of research work like load balance and fire firewalls and in the the area of client, but technically, we think that they are not strictly computing in the network, but actually hardware input implementations of network functions. We think that for the computing in the network, they are very closely coupled with applications. We think that the client is actually to offload application specific functions to network elements, so as to accelerate applications. So these applications specific functions are described by computing primitives or called operations or semantics And until next slide, please. Some academic research and industrial practice call has been summarized in this table. And they're mostly case by case design and they they need to rely heavily on programmable network devices.

So this may race a very higher high are for the application development. So I think that we need to define a very app location development we think of a way to make it easier for the application development. So to make the developers to better leverage the network capabilities owned by the operators because most of the application development may come come from third parties So in this drop, we think that we wanna to increase the generic... General and of the coin development and promote the standard standardization of the the of coin. So in this probably, we summarize general computing printers from the existing research work and also that we also want to hope to promote them to be standardized and these primitives can implemented it inside normal network devices rather than programming network devices. So... And also, we propose the generic framework of calling the control environment. Thank you. Next slide, please.

So These different tasks. So you can see that differently, So we need to think of about we also need to and make them all all down in the schedule layer.

Do you think the considerations would change a lot if we didn't focus on controlled environments, but just focus on the say technical requirements computing in general. Thank you very good question. I think that controlling relevance is very initial, you know, for the deployment, it's very initial, like current research focused in data centers like they are controlled.

So maybe make it scalable, we think that one day that the framework work may extend to an environment that not control all be shared by different providers or like that. Thank you. Okay. Thanks.

And your operating system all or are with you call the program, but I would call it they're more like what the previous talk was talking about maybe some some primitives but I think this is where the big security aspects happen is that in order for that computer board to to function the nodes have to be have to be part of the security framework.

So how would you see the evolution of which your doing into maybe a much more capability instead of... Well, not a... Well, think capability goes back to what people are saying, We need running code at one point but I think So my question is, how do you see that evolution of the security?

You know, if you think that as a traditional operating system. You have How can you measure the in a software there?

And the life of the application that needs all these packets better. Next slide. Well, that's that's just a a a an overview. So So after we did the the the use case and the terminology, well the next one is Are we going to stop at describing things or are we going to do more research. Because right now, this stuff is what we have is It's essentially opening up some good questions, and that's actually that's what the use case document does very well. Is opening up directions for research. So we we started thinking, should we do another Well, That's what it this way. When we did the work at the beginning, we had in the use case, not only the requirements, but also elements of analysis, and it was uneven. Some of the use cases had already more in the analysis existing some less And so the document was a bit of... Was a bit messy, so we decided to take the analysis again, out of the use case document and making making itself into another I have a document. And that one is is fairly new. Next slide. So So this This is to go beyond the descriptions and to"

So it started with And that you... That's the status. What we have we actually we found that there are good research questions. We would like to go into deeper analysis and it'll ask thing here that who described this Well it's the asking thing again. So that there are application area applicability, we have again identified things related to transport, application design, data processing, that includes network elements, routing and forwarding which could be in help by adding in that we're computing, I would say more and more also probably load balancing which was at the beginning and congestion control is probably there. Industrial control is something that I'm very much aware is is a real big applicability area because it touches so many elements in data driven approaches. We see also distributed computing frameworks and languages for coin, before like I said, it's pretty limited, so they could be very interesting distributed computing, And I would... Actually, I would say combination of distributed computing and networking frameworks where are the enabling technologies? There's there's new hardware, nvidia and Intel."

Next draft? Extra. Next page. So again, questions for the Rg, we started this again, the same type of peep the same group of people, so it's always us. So who can take over managing the document, especially with I who may graduate soon. But I think it's an important document and we feel that it would be important to do this analysis, I think this whole presentation today showed that there's there's a lot of people asking some interesting questions about where the the validity of the research has been done and is it going in the right direction? Obviously, people who are doing the work we have our own view of of where this could be going and it would be... I think it's important to do the analysis because right now, it's interesting to say, oh, great. You know, in that computing is perfect for federated learning. Because we need it, but it's another thing of saying it's perfect for federated learning because we did it and it is much better than what is happening or by distributing the computing from the data center and edge network or going back to the net edge network, which, like, some people have said, It's more eco friendly and it takes away a lot of the big big ecological impacts of data centers"

Are there any questions? And again, we since Dirk and Ike are not there, I would recommend that people read read the the drafts and that questions could go on the list so that everybody can can participate and But again, I think there's... I think the take home on these tree tree drafts is one we would like the use case to go to research group last call. The terminology is something that needs to evolve and the analysis is something that needs to be done. Yep. Any question or comments or suggestions from audio? And since Eve has joined us, after having all kinds of problems. Maybe if you want to take over the your last few minutes of the of the meeting, to discuss future capabilities. Oh, Dirk is there? Okay. Yeah. Hi. Quick. The could Hp. I'm so. So on all of these documents, also, the the coin directions that you"

I think one general question for the group is how many documents and of which nature do we want to push towards the Editor direction. And so of course, in general, it's good to have say high quality output and then document this is as our seats as well. But for example, for the coin elections draft that we started we actually we're not quite sure. I mean, So these drafts can serve different purposes. Right? So one them mean one purpose is two. Just have something to talk about in the group. And and other purpose could be, you know, to publish something maybe to the outside world and something that also maybe has a bit longer relevance And So sometimes I'm not sure I'm say, how many documents we should actually you know, publish as ever overseas. So personally, my preference is to Yeah. Focus on experimental specifications mostly. And then if there's any other important and say sure enough say architectural work or some analysis work, of course, they could be considered as well. But I I could see it be if there's it's a it's like too much informational and material that that we try to get published. This is Mir. I agree, but would you want your I think your your draft was was very important for this group. So you know, I I think personally, I think also in the name of of Jeff and Eve were"

Who was looking for information about coin, and I would have loved to be able to direct them to your draft. So My my my answer is Maybe we don't need to make that decision now. Maybe at one point, we will bring back the terminology and the use cases. And maybe the use case analysis will go back in the use case, but I think for... I don't know if we're I don't if we're there. You know, because I I think part of discussion is that we have a number of an interesting thing that were started and eve discovery draft is also expired. And But I don't know. I I I will return the question to you. Does matter? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. I mean, we don't have to make a decision right now and I also want to apologize not having done these updates you know, just life came in the way to many. Other things is well. You're all there. But happy to discuss this maybe offline, and maybe let's so I just try to find a good set of documents that we would like to continue developer. Okay. Thank you. There's call is colon perkins. So I I I agree that it it is. A good thing to think about the set of documents this group should produce and to be strategic about what those documents. Are I will remind you again that"

There there are many ways of getting that understanding and and the draft one of them and perhaps a very useful way of organizing thoughts and and, you know, sometimes it's certainly appropriate for research groups to produce our season an experimental space notifications and so. But research papers and collections are papers and organizing material is also useful. And you know, we we we... As a research group that don't just focus on draft focus on the research and organizing that research I'm being point people that the the research the group is doing growth than the drafts of the people are doing. Yeah. And I think that the the use case graph we wanted to go around with a little bit of the state of the art and research. So, you know, it it's a that's... It's a matter document for for the research that's existing, but I I know. It's it But at the other Yeah. I... You know, we just had that discussion before. On documents, But at the same time, it would be nice to capture somewhere that the flavor of of coin that we want to to push as a research group, but I following. So And we don't... I agree it it's very useful to have have this material to be able to point people at it. I will just encourage you to be creative about how you do that and address are not the only mechanism for doing it Sometimes they're very appropriate and on pushing things our is very appropriate. And sometimes for a research group, there there are other ways which achieve the goals better. Sure. We have one minute left. Eve you want to add something. Sure. Can you hear me? Sure. Yes."

That said, in terms of going forward, in for this group. One of the things that we have talked about with regular, but haven't delivered on is to have perhaps an interim meeting where we do a little bit of this reference perspective, where are we now compared to when we first began. And I I think it actually in light of this past discussion or dialogue between Colin and Gi about how... And even dirt is how to use the working group in terms of creating specs? Versus creating an organization of collections of research one thing we would really like to do is to have maybe this interim and talk about how the field has evolve since the time we started this group. So I think that is top of mind that we'd like to get to, we would like to set an interim between now and July. To do that. And perhaps alongside of that, we we try to gauge... What are the best ways to be creative about achieving that state of the art and pointers for those who come into the coin arena looking for how to navigate it and how to get started and how to levels that. So I think that's all I'll say here for now, and thank you for running such great meeting. Maria me say in Jeffrey without mattel for me. Although I I did try to capture minutes from the moment and something. So thank you all so much to.
