    "text": "is and in that scenario basically you don\u0027t care that people discover that there is a printer on the network because of course there is a printer at the network but what you do care is that it\u0027d be better if you did not identify who is using the printer at what time and that\u0027s that\u0027s really the requirement there to give an example of how mdns for example doesn\u0027t completely meet that requirement mdns in order to participate the guy was doing the discovery as to initiate and DNS and to do that they have to broadcast their host name on the local network and that broadcasting of the host name is worth tracking you so that it\u0027s easily fixed it\u0027s not hard to do but it\u0027s not done yet the real requirement for discovery is for peer-to-peer scenarios and I say for example the head the airport scenario you\u0027re in an airport lounge and you are preparing a presentation with a colleague and you are discovering each other it\u0027d be better if the people who are also in the air for F of launch did not immediately identify was doing what I mean because that might reveal that you have is cover operation going on and finally okay thanks as you know about ID so here whoever in this scenario SD we got a piece of feedback that the the man in the heart was not identified properly in the in the picture as the bad actor so not in the heart is hiding in the background is listening what\u0027s happening and because all these message are sent in clear text you can see them on the network and it\u0027s obvious how you see them in with a multicast but even if they are sand as GNSS deal with the DNS SD server as long as you can get the flow of messages you\u0027re going to identify that David here is looking for stores laptop name and and finding it on the network and and you can discover that so that that\u0027s the kind of stuff we want to not happen and there is the third scenario is a variant of that with wearable devices if you have wearable devices and you use this kind of discovery scenarios to send broadcast messages to find them and to initiate communications not only do we discover that there is this communication but you can track the person doing that like if in order to for your watch to discover your your iPhone the iPhone ask to broadcast its presence on the waves then that becomes a beacon that anybody can touch and so "
