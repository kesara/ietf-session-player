    "text": "the thought develop approach in this document at the moment is we experiment lease this is more of a scorched-earth approach in the fact that it would immediately expire the lease it will send out any dhcp release to the network to clear out any possible sale states within the network how many proxies and relays and then it will move against the solicit and discovery face to allow the authentication and stealing the soils so actually it will do passive observation of the neighbor - I mean it can take actually goes away but if it\u0027s visits new resuscitation and so you can actually use passive signals to active see if he is hard for some reason there\u0027s a rope here so I guess film aft will be quite every ways and then that probably will make that second point there irrelevant because it would actually require control plane processing and the BJ was 50-acre and I had I had a chat with Jeff from juniper on our list of Aramis EFT echo style so we\u0027ll probably have to rename this because if Diego isn\u0027t literally true the muscle guard so it would be a simple dumb IP UDP Datagram addressed IP address to yourself so the Benjy filter back to you so Johnny speaking at a general coming about a couple things over so first we have four different recovery mechanisms and you have like tunable parameters in DHCP and how do you expect people implement up correctly when you have so many combinations I mean it\u0027s easy to say okay we\u0027ve got like 16 combinations of ways to do this and we\u0027re gonna clamp our vendors if they get any of them wrong but it seems easier to say well we only have one way to do this into the more likely to result in success I feel so I would think everyone looks good to have lots of options you might be able to gain consensus on your own the graph or easily it\u0027s like if you chop them down it\u0027s actually gonna be more yeah thank you for threat of rust I have been "
