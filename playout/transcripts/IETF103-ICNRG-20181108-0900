    "text": "approaches one is too similar to the the 6lowpan approach to put a context specific state like prefixes or other stuff in in common knowledge that is identified by the by context identifier so you don\u0027t need to carry it in the packets because it will be redundantly communicated for instance common prefixes common suffixes common options and the second approach which is that\u0027s unique to add to an ICN approach is to replace the the names in the in the if you send an interest you send a name and if you reply to this actually the name is replied again at you you elide this name by or we like this name by generating short-short local ID so making it sort of a stateful hop compression this has a following as a message much stronger impact here so if you look at the the example of the interest if you compress this only using the common prefix out and you\u0027re in the compression in this example by about 40 percent in the data case where you omit the full name then we are really down to to something that is very small which is important just recap these these link layers have very short NTU sizes and it is a it\u0027s a real advantage if we can put packets or if you can can construct packets that that fit into these small in sizes of 127 bytes or so so this was more or less to give the the overview and what we we are now at is we we have a draft that has a sort of shape and we have we want to stimulate a couple of discussions first of all the India and CCN X faults so the question is is this actually this were these other compressions as you like that is it does it meet me the the the the perspective of of the groups also question that some type and length restrictions in the compression so names can be only a certain number of by its name components and so on question is is this okay just to recap we can always send uncompressed interest in data so it doesn\u0027t mean that we are where we are doing onto the network but if we if we compress them we have some restrictions and question is are they feasible and do they actually match the common use cases are they actually that the useful things to do and in our call to the community "
