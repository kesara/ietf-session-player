I'll talk about that in a minute. I am Wes He and with me is clear, my coach. You'll hear from her in a minute. The mailing list is on the bottom that you can sign up for. One note is that the mailing list is sat, but the protocol has a key at the the working group has a p at the end, long time with we'd, like, four letter acronyms and the mailing list was created with only three letters. So we the Note well is extremely important since this group does contain a number of newer people spent a little bit more time going over this you should consult the lawyer for your company or something like that, But the important takeaway is that the things you say in the Etf, you're sort of contributing those. And you need to acknowledge that anything you anything you do or say here that includes in the chat to you the the chat conversation. Anything that that you contribute is sort of becomes for the H. But consult your lawyer if you're not sure. There's actually some really good best current practice documents, Bc that cover how the H works and how the standardization process works. That includes you know, how the working groups work. Most importantly, it also includes our anti harassment behaviors or could have conduct copyright and patent for and participation related information. Again, those are well worth reading. And, of course, we'll stick to them. The quick summary of the code of conduct guidelines for that that one is treat everybody with respect. Speak slower than I am right now.

So it's important that you understand that when you're contributing. And also note that as I said, the chat session is also recorded, so don't think that chat session is a place where you can say things that won't be publicly recorded. For remote participants, make sure that your audio and video are often less your really sharing or talking during the the session? And, you know, a headset is highly useful in order to prevent echo and things like that. For information about this working group, you know, the purpose is really to develop a protocol to transfer digital assets between two different networks. Obviously, the charter has much more descriptive text about everything that we're doing, including some scope, which will go over in a minute.

So Claire has already scheduled all of these ahead of time. I think they're on the second Tuesday of every month. Is that because As close as a close can't be to the second Tuesday of every month.

And we'll have time for any other business as well. I'll come back to that in the minute after claire is done explaining the scope. It'll make more sense then. Thank you. So as this is our first official... As this is our first official working group. We wanted to spend five minutes recap the scope. And this comes out of the discussion that was had in the bath in London. And is very much fed by the Focus and what I'd likes to focus for our initial skype So in summary, to develop a single protocol for secure one way, transfer any digital asset, and we will come on to what that means. Between networks, they must be agnostic to the technology of the network and the nature of the asset. We'll break that down in the next slide, but just to give you an overview for the tech look like This is based on roughly based on a three phase commit between gateways. So is just the transfer of the assets between the gateways. That we are focusing on for the first initial scope. Thank. What that does mean? Is that with the single directional uni interaction, to use their official term asset transfer and gateway to Gateway. What that does mean is the out of scope that we would very much like to to roadmap for future discussions. Is the multi directional or asset swapping? Anything that's not included in our description on our terminology and our definition of what a digital asset is. So we might have to limit the assets covered?

Happy to continue to use the mailing this discussion for other. And of course, there is the idea that once this protocol is far enough down the line and and we'll come on to what that process looks like. We can then start to bring in other points of discussion and expand the scope for for future documents. So what does that process look like? Is a high level flow? As fairly needs to the. Where kindly taking me through the the process. It's not as linear as it looks. You can see there's there's a a feedback loop. So where we are today step one? We've got three documents we've started them. We do need to agree that we're old happy that this is the correct starting position that there's no major disagreements with what we've got so far in the position that we're starting in. These will then be call for formal adoption as Working documents. Simply means that there officially the documents that we are working on and these are the documents that will then be taking through the process. We will continue to have the working group discussions, the interim meeting, the discussion on the mailing list, and I know the authors and editors are having side meetings inside conversations as well that will continue. The feedback and the outputs of that that is within the scope, we'll be edited and revised in the document and we can come on to where that's stored and how to do that.

So that was quite a quick five minutes. If everyone's happy with that, we can continue onto the terminology. John. Sorry. You say transfer, is there an assumption that it's gone from the old place and it's in the new place or it might be in both places or it's just a higher level question? Yes. No. That is exactly what we mean by transfer. We'll come onto that. I think Thomas got some slides that cover that in more detail. Yes. That is the the core understanding. To avoid spend is one of the areas. Alright. Thank you. Actually, I I'll add one more beyond implemented is deployed. So there's really another step and that's... That's really our goal. Right? Didn't think about that until this now. So one of the things that I think when Claire I were talking and watching that is happened on the mailing that's where we're... We left the fact that the conversation is is very vibrant on the mailing list. But there is some different people throwing around different terms and we sort of decided it would probably be good to agree upon some terms. So we wanted to ensure that, you know, all the documents were using a common terminology set. They were all sort of based on the same vocabulary. When we have discussions, we should try and use the same terminology to It's very easy to slip into different things as each person has a different goal for how they might wanna deploy the protocol on the end, But we need to make sure we sort of matches the scope."

There is a document in a github repository, and this will get turned into sort of draft format text and either included in one of the existing documents for published is a third one. It's technically not in our charter but that's really not a big problem to add. Out a vocabulary document really shouldn't bug the Ie g, I don't think not gonna go over all of these today, but I was gonna sort of some of the important ones and and the wording, you know, I think this is Alex's first pass. But there's a few, you know important things that we might wanna talk about. For an example, a digital asset is any asset that is purely digital or a digital representation of a physical asset. Right? That is what we are talking about transferring. Now after each one of these I'll pause for a little bit. And if you have a comment about you know, making sure that we want to include or exclude, I guess something or, you know, you disagree with the phrasing this the phrasing will be I'm sure iterate much more over the mailing list these are sort of the important ones I want to hit today.

Regardless of Covid. I've been in pretty warm small rooms that were way over overcrowded. So everybody please do, use the Qr code. Or you can go to the agenda on the on the website and and click the video and that'll log you in as well.

And but we won't dive into that today. And then as John go how you bothering you. Please. What what this legal mean? So that is one of the words that I looked at that sentence two and because legal has so many different jurisdictions. So That is a good question. And so I'm assuming you mean it's it's the owners sort of within the... Within the context of whatever the whatever the The thing at the end of the protocol is Yeah. And and I would also think of it as the owner within the existing asset network. Right? Legal probably should be dropped from that sentence, but I'm trying to think of, you know, we want some sort of notion of there is an owner and Yeah. And I guess the... Mean, this Without trying to rat hole too much. Need in the real world of the legal owner and the owner on the piece of paper. Usually but not always the same and Yeah. Thank you, John. That's a very good point, and we should definitely edit that and refine that. My understanding this is speaking not as a chair is that this should be representing the owner of the an originating network in terms of the person who is authorized to move that asset around. So we can definitely clarify that, and it's a really good point to take away. Thank you. I'll say between the two of us. I'm more the expert on the Atf protocol on she has everything else. So"

So the gateways participate between themselves using the developed protocol to transfer an asset from, you know, one originating network to a to another one. That is the scope of of the working group today, We will say that in the future, there has been discussion of whole can't, we also define protocols what's used inside of a network, or maybe this protocol can be used, but that's not within the initial chartered. That would be a future work item. If it looks like there was a common way that people wanted to do interoperability and inside different networks. And then back in part two, John's point earlier, there's both burning and mint and that is the a transaction, you know, carries out this digital asset and transfers it from one network to another and it does that. By destroying or burning the value of the digital asset and originating network and then recreating it or, you know, mint it in the new network networks. So that is what the the transfer essentially amounts to is a simultaneous destruction and and creation. And obviously that is a potentially hard thing to pull off, you know, to to get that right, which is why we have a whole working group on the problem. So that is just the end of the terminology. As I said, there's there's actually a bunch more terminology if we look at the full list, but those are I think the important ones that I wanted to cover today. I'll note that there's a bunch of other ones. If you think of something missing, then it should probably be added to the list, and we can bring that up on the mailing list. One, I think the most important thing to note in my mind is the scope of of this working group is not just standard blockchain blockchain. Right?

One of the reasons for this terminology list is we're trying not to use terminology that is specific to one type of asset network or one type of of implementation on one side. And of course, generic terminology is hard to get right you know, in a way that everybody agrees to. But as you're talking on the mailing list please do try and will slowly converge to a standard set of terminology. So With that, any discussion on the terminology good news is we're ahead of schedule, but that's okay. Because the other stuff will take a lot longer.

The second big thing is So we've been having this discussion about context So when we when we first started, this this this this working group. There this question about who actually... What triggers or who triggers the flow. And so if you look at the diagram, there is in fact an application this app one and Apt meaning, originating app and destination app and we assume there is some context there that's other scope how the application talk to each other and someone on that's a business application Business logic it's how of price. What we do assume is that Somehow, these two endpoints are going to share what we call a session Id and the session Id is a number a string of whatever. That is included in the flows so that the gate please know that this particular handshake is for this session Id. And reasoning behind that is because you could have two applications, business applications doing conducting multiple transfers and some of them or even all of them could be going through the same to pair same pair peers gateway. And so to gateway rid themselves the need to know what the session. How we compute the right decision Id It's either the out scope or Tb, we just... We just saying. It's a string. Unique, you know, globally uni unique stream. And lastly, I think part of the processes, we we would like to ask the working group to take this sub in adopt version three as a working group item, the the starting point for the the formal work of the working group.

In fact, I've been saying for a while that this is very reminiscent of the days of the land technology for those who are old enough know what Ibm Sn and d net and and for for those who are big kinds of ethan if you guys noticed that bob got a the touring award last week week before. The the guy who go ethernet. So the what we're seeing now in this digital asset network space is the same problems. So poor scalability. So so you'll see these, you know news items, you know, bridges being hacked and on. And and there's a lot of reasons for that. And it's it's think it's because they're using proprietary big bridges that really have no formal protocol specific notifications and have not been analyzed both at the protocol level and the implementation compliance level. There is no spec which is this you can't do any compliance against expect if respect doesn't exist. And, of course, there's lack of standards for security. And if you're just Google so now good one is, you know, if a if a problem makes it to the front page Cnbc, then, you know you know it's a problem. This is Google Cnbc. I think it's July last year. One point four billion dollars lost. Through all this crazy... They call the bridge and hack hacking the bridges. Next slide. And so this is the diagram you saw before.

So you know, for for those who who are young enough, you may be surprised that mainframe are still being sold and and there is a shortage of cobalt developers for those in cobalt. And for those in the financial industry, you you not because yeah you are you are desperately looking for cobalt developers. By that, I mean, there's there this monolithic systems out there that, you know, that handle transactions high volume. And so we have to also be cognizant and address that segment of the market because a lot of these financial institutions have or billions and billions of dollars into their It infrastructure and then I'm gonna rip that out just because there's some you know, new technology down the road. It's really sort of our job is engineers to make sure there's some integration path. That makes sense that's technically sound and and, you know, implement. Next slide, please. Thank you. So so the goal, this is like kind of formal language, we we have to define the goals we were doing the box, you know. So it's an it's a product protocols to allow the movement of a value bearing data object. So if you if you guys are familiar with D that networks, blockchain, you know, people use the word token generically. So it's. Meaning it's on the the ledger on the the blocks of the records of the ledger. And yes, it's just a This is a byte string, but it signifies some economic value that the human beings or the the community around it have have agreed upon to assign value to that data object.

So are properties, so it has to support private networks. Right? And this is a big contention, you know, you know, when I when I have dialogues with undergrad at an mit I to explain to them know, there is no such thing is a public open Internet. You know, all these networks our Isp network. So, you know, are sequence have to use the word sequence. So, you know, when when you were watching a movie off, in Amazon servers that routed the you know, West coast and you're sitting in the East Coast.

Singapore government has put a lot of money into this. You hear trade lenses and someone on. That's a Jv between, you know, Ibm and Mae shipping company if you dig deeper, you'll see these are private networks. Know, they might be you you know, as a helper utilizing a public permission know, blockchain, but you look deeper, it's all private. So so we have to be ready for that scenario. It has to work as I said before one side of both our legacy systems. And then has to have the asset properties I'm gonna talk I've got a slide on the asset properties. Which is a borrowed terminology for from databases for those remember doing the undergraduate database courses from the It is in a nineties your you'll remember is not. You remember these these words. Next slide. So I apologize for long time because this is going back to one zero one, but I kinda feel I have to explain this because these are the two principles that we have included in the architecture doc So the first thing is the Opec resources principle. And that is literally a barring we're stealing from the Autonomous systems principle. And so the I idea there is that you can't design a protocol that is dependent on a data construct in a remote network. Why because you have no control. Many reasons, that remote network might change the Api it my change... It might go away. You kinda... It's just, you know, becomes un scalable."

Don't design with the assumption that you can see because in fact, you can't see it. And other thing is maybe lack of a bit of phrase of the value principle. So the gateways themselves need to be agnostic oblivious to the value. The role of gateways to do the fastest way do the transfer a commitment to finish the commitment and to ensure both networks not consistent. And you hear the word consistent use... Meaning that there's no double spend. Literally what that means. And this is the analog to the end to end principles. Principal for those who are on the mailing list with L there, there was some the thread... This is coming back there as well this this whole end to end design principle. Next slide, please. So so for those long jeff, you know, you can follow... You can go to sleep this slide the next slide. You know, independence of each network is really what the A means. Right? So if you look at nice isp network you know, it's an independent network. It doesn't rely on anything outside of it. It's got clear boundaries, you know, so typical network, it could be one riding domain, It could be multiple sub domains and so on. But when it talks to an adjacent Isp network, it uses, you know, specific types of routers. Border routers and running Bg for samples. Right? So so the Bg portion is standardized, and that's what we're trying to develop here is to gateway the Gateway protocol that's akin to a bg. Okay. Next slide. And enter to end principle, the"

The conclusion is now you know, draw the tcp ip internet is to do routing as fast as possible you know, best effort delivery and so on, and encryption really needs to be at the end endpoints, which is why we end up having Ip seconds, and so working beautifully because of this of this principle. Okay. So I will go... If this is just an overview Rama is gonna do his slides and I'll go back to this. So we divide the flow into three stages try for initiation is the currently a bit of a hand wave there because this is all most of this out of for us. The stage two is where Gateway one makes an assertion that it's done its job in locking or disabling the asset in the Origin network. And then the other side gateway to has to formally give a response to this, and we just call that a receipt. And then stays three is when both sides are ready to pull the trigger literally. And then the the gateway one will issue a a final a commit message and you if if you guys know too face commit in databases, you'll see this is actually a three phase commit, which is a variant end of the too phase commit.

So we spend a lot of time in the group about gateway crashes and I think there's there is a document somewhere that Rafael wrote that talks about what happens. What are the options to you know, increase reliability. So in this case, durability means that once a transaction once you wanted you to commit, and one or both of them crashes immediately after that commitment it's done. Right? So...

What the the problem that results from having all of these different candidate groups and also It will at One on different tech tac is that you have a partition of the of what should not be a completely partition world, and there are partitions of different kinds. You can have additional assets that are that that lie or that is recorded on one particular ledger within one particular network are not accessible to a different network. But in the real world, these assets need to move around for for various purposes in order to fulfill the different workflow. What what happens if they cannot do that or that then you need some kind of an ad hoc or a mechanism or sort of a test third party to enable that kind of communication of of the the assets as well as the state to happen.

So one a major example and this has been gaining a lot of interest the past two years especially is central visual currency And here you may have seen lot of new reports on different countries as well as different groups of countries trying to figure out whether they can adopt central digital currencies and lot of experiments have been going on in this respect.

I mentioned those minimum other ecosystem metals networks that are that been created everything been coming up in the past few years. One network which Thomas mentioned the statements It it's So the network, you see the top right that approximately ...it's it's inspired by tables like network which manage straight logistics.

And what that does is it it fills an obligation on a buyer or it's the device bag, to make a payment upon production of proof that goods have been dispatched. So you can see here there's link between the two networks, you the letter credit in on the left side network, needs to trigger the shipping in the right side network and the the proof for shipment is producing in the right side network, but it needs to be consumed with the left side network. In the real world, people chose to all the other the enterprises that are building these networks used to separate these processes for for particular for for the good reasons.

In one network, to a different network. And that is strictly speaking a... A slightly different way of different you're doing from a, which is moving an asset from hundred to the other.

I think we started two years ago with And one of the things that became very clear is that a gateway g one and g to gateway operator. The best I can do is to provide a signed assertion that they've done the right thing. This is very important for private networks because Gateways may not be able to export evidence proof for that specific type of network. Yeah Networks that you could do that, but not all networks can do that. The other thing is that now the claims carries the asset Id and asset profile Id, we'll see in the next couple of slides. And of course, as before we would like to request this document to be adopted as the starting point document for the working group. Next slide, please. So this is what the message looks like if you look at the dry section eight point three. Basically, we're saying message type is now locked assert And and there's a clean section there, which has a claim his body. And that's where the statement. So this is signed statement. Right? And and the the owner of the gateway the operator is let's put it this way. It is liable. Financially liable if it lies. Right? Next slide, please.

Thomas can I interrupt you from So I wanna be clear about your use of the terminology because you just confuse me? Is is the diagram gonna change ex to burn later if that's what we decided is or or yes or mike are are they too different depressed? No. No. No. But. I didn't wanna update this diagram a week before that trip. Absolutely brother. Anytime you see I'm gonna use the word burn. Okay. From. My my my bad. I quite bad. I just didn't Know. So So the three point five eight is a burn. I have burned the asset. Okay. And that was and I it's saying it's making the statement of three point it's a sign visually signed legally binding assertion. So if g one lies about this, for it. Right? the operate upgrade is liable Beyond that, we have no way to to know this because of the network would be private. It could be a database private database, we can't peer into it. You can't see into it. So now, g two who receives the message saying well. I already created the asset earlier, now I can just do a quick assignment to bob. That's also fast. Right So Once G two does that, it performs acknowledge of the, you know, final act back to G one saying, okay. I now sign an assertion saying that I have allocate allocated I have assigned asset to bob the beneficiary in network too. Right. And then three point nine is optional if G one wants to say. Well, you know what? Yes. This this happened at this particular time. I'm gonna write it to my my ledger or my my local database Yes. I we think three point nine is very useful. And then the whole thing is closed in three point ten. So that's kind of the flow. And"

On next slide might be the last one. I think I think we did that slide before. Next one. Okay. And and I'm happy to go back to any of the slides Thank you. So if we can open the floor twenty questions or comments, No. Okay? So so I have one. This... This diagram in this this flow have changed a lot over time. How do how stable, Do you think, you know, is it you're talking about it all the time in the meetings. But but I think it's becoming more Yeah. How are we doing? I think we're we're pretty stable. I think other than my type over in line three point four three point five. I think I think we have agreement in the in the group that this is the flow. And the task of the core spec is to detail all the payloads as I saw before in Slide two. Right? Session Id should be there and some and so on. But quick answer, yes. This is now version sixteen. And at the end of that, I hope to update do that type of correction and and remove the word ex extinguished and use the word burn consistently and update that to become version seventeen. And if you look at the the online version that these blue comments, lines and the circles, el on the size, that's meant to represent the state of the asset in each network. Thank you.

Yeah. Yes, David but there's there's more we need to do, but you know, this this document needs to be the formal document that the group wears on. Is is my understanding of... Yes. Adoption. Just to recap Atf press this work comes to a working group you, as an individual submission and then there's a call adoption saying, you know, this is the right starting place. There's nothing it may still missing stuff. But you know, nobody disagrees that this is the wrong direction to start with. And when it becomes a working group document. It's it's no longer the authors. It's actually the working groups and the author still gets to make changes. But The working group actually has the the absolute ability to say hey Thomas you're wrong here. We don't care how many times you're right. You know, you must change this document in this paragraph in this way to match the consensus of the working group regardless of what the actual editor of the document was. So a call for adoption in the beginning is really is this the right starting document for the working group to take on? It is not the inclusion where we actually wanna publish it as a standards document. That comes after everybody agrees. That it's final final final done, and there will be a a a working group last call, which is what we will start saying the working groups done, and then I'll go to the entire Etf process even after that. But does that clarify Things David Yes. Did you wanna bring up some we have time. So if you wanted to bring up some of the things that you have concerns about, I think you know, this is why we have these meetings and feel free to to voice. Well, as I said, I I think we We just hack a little... You know, this is an application layer our protocol on. I think we we have to look at each step and see what consequences what of the... What we have what has to be done. At each point where is a failure an error or whatever. Yep."

I think the chair said that there was somebody in the room who didn't, you know, raise their hand or not raise their hand, and They're just gonna explain why I reading Mail and wasn't paying any attention. I have no views on it adoption. So we wait to did you click do not raise hand? There was one person that clicked do not raise hand. That's the person I was watching. Okay. Never mind question was who didn't bother participate little was a like that on at. Not not sidetracked tracks into other stuff at all. Understood. Thanks for. Anything also, I think we can go the any other business. Just not here, but roma is like about large. Good good they can execute. Okay. Thank you. So that closes that section, we'll skip over documents ready for as we've covered the office we've gone through each document, which brings us now to any other business. We did have a question from Dennis. I'm not... I can't see him in the room. So rama, did you want to introduce the topic that you had in terms of leg state views. Sure. I can just do really briefly.

Okay. So these are two documents that describe one of the more that is alluded to in the document if you see the architecture document, there are sort of categorized the applications of or or the need all need interoperability among different especially blockchain Dr systems, my folder Yeah.

Based on the... Which is extracted from the latest snapshot. So transfer that into the blockchain world do you have is you have networks. Get these two data partition by only there is somebody in one network who wants to know some subtle information in a a different network as is recorded in that networks ledger. So the view of the terminal terminology be used to to describe that. It's information derived from a letter. It's in a, blockchain system, it's kind of proof of the state of that particular blockchain. So it's not just information. Like, in a any a database, you would just exact information based on the in response to the query that but client poses. But here we need both the speed as well as the proof, because you have because this query is cutting across net boundaries across like, please. So what you want... And the... This is security concern. Which is that one cannot trust the word of just one party that is sharing this a particular ledger. Okay? Remember this is... This this can be underneath this"

They're using some kind of a protocol to to agree on what the latest state of the ledger should be. What this view requires for what... Let me see in in the D balance we call it the view is it's the permission database you. Plus some sort of proof that that indicates that whatever informations returned a consensus view of the parties which are saying that. So that is the of talking about it. And this especially significant permission ledger or or private networks where which are by default opaque to outside entities. And views can be, you know, going from this simple one give information, Like, if if the ledger is built on Key repairs, just requesting the value one particular key or it can be a collection of keys or can be some sort of function that you're running over to related. The associated the view is what we can call a view address that by it's kind of like Url And hopefully, I mean, let me get make mix some advances, this can be... We can think of how to this in the same way, the Urls turned right. The request asked for a particular view by formulating a view address. And As still have the old term would app, which is the earlier name for. But you can think of this as ct. So you can have... You can see here that different kinds of technologies this one called Fabric and the, which then if you may may know? And we can create such view addresses"

So as long as an external party knows how to add particular piece of information, it can formulate view address. It sends... It makes a request of a different ledger. And get back to you. That is the motion. And What is not explicitly five here is this is this should happen through the two gateway it. So you have one network an Gateway? And there's anything with here? And the part again that we would like to stand here is not whatever is going on? In the back, we don't care about what can't the view about how the data is structured and so on. All you concerned about is whether a particular Gateway can communicate a view address and get back to you in response and do some basic validation checks. In our system, this is called system called C under triple. Foundation where we are technical solutions for purpose interoperability across both permission and permission less networks and like asset a transfer is one of those features, which is what we're trying standard under. There's also just the general notion of sharing data across different ledger which allows two networks to interconnect and just to communicate the street. In effect, you we are taking two state machines and we can build a bigger virtual state machine across two different networks and two different workflows, without forcing an integration of the two different networks That's what if you remember the use case enrolling that that's what that is trying to can be. So these are just structures copied from the from the cath project."

But long winded the protocol for communicating for requesting a view address via our gateways in voluntary, we call it really relay but that's meant to confirm to whatever how we start gateway. You're supposed to make a request from one that from an application one network, to another network, get a just network generates proof. It also runs accidental checks to determine whether or not request be satisfied. Send back response and Then the network here validates is proof. It's not just up to the application to just submit that information. So Yeah. This is the part that is in the... If you look at the draft that I that it showed let see. Yeah. So there are two drops one of them talking about deals in view addresses and As they're talking about the request response protocol and Yeah. This is This is sort of the version protocol. So... Yeah. Thanks. That's that's all I wanted to. Can convey. This is again, to be clear, and as I'm sure resin that will remind you again, this is not in the current scope with the jordan, but later on once we've standardizing the transfer protocol the call, like to bring this up again for discussion and but please feel free to look at the drafts and give or give any of doctors comments.

It's it's good to have something written because we have to have, you know, a common understanding at least one possible way. There is another draft by shipping can, which is in the I think it might have been expired. And that's on gateway identification. So if you remember my slides there was... There's a thing called the the payload, there was a network Id and surprise surprise there is today no standard for identifying ledger network Id. There is no As number. There is no... You know, there is no body like Aaron wake said give me an As number. Doesn't exist. Right? So So we're trying to well, shipping is trying to create a way to quickly identify gateway so that you can verify the owner and settlements on and on. That's a future work item as well There's a rudimentary draft that needs to be updated desperately I think... But yeah, that's future work. Excellent. Rama? Thomas you mentioned the draft that rafael had been working on one for not management to gateways. Right? That's also future work or Do you think that kind of fits into what you doing here. Yes.
