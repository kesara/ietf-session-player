    "text": "obviously our next steps in terms of evaluation effort who would like to add additional evaluations for the Wi-Fi test case using the few you know extra codecs the code is already it\u0027s really a matter of bargaining them and recording on the results and one the LTE test case implementations already another colleague of mine is working on that item or hope to also add evaluations in industry for using these codecs and from the draft point of view though we think the draft is you know I mean there\u0027s no more pending edits from the authors at this point and we would like to obtain review input from the working group and given that now we\u0027re in the face of trying to ship ship all the evaluation drafts for then for consideration of working group last call I think this this draft also belongs to that category so any input or questions from the audience questions or comments for shouting I\u0027m a co-author of this job I have been reading this job every time charging desam up there so it\u0027s in pretty good shape actually and it quite good reflection what is in the code so that\u0027s that\u0027s a good thing just to clarify this additional evolution of Wi-Fi just kassemg test if that is that has nothing to do with the draft right there\u0027s something a different thing Charles II was mentioning so yeah I think it\u0027s ready for work so we would like to sign up reviewers basically yeah okay any other comments or objections to pushing this draft forward us no okay then I think we can push all four of them okay very good thank you searching thank you so this was the last item on the agenda unless anyone has anything they would like to add or bring up John Maddox I was just thinking given the discussion about chairs lunch I was wondering if this would be an interesting topic to do a hackathon at the next IETF to have people working on our MCAT related stuff if they knew it that\u0027s something that people you know it might be worth asking people about or whatever because I know there\u0027s you know "

    "text": "then some thought about getting us into the browsers that will have RBZ stacks particularly so mm-hmm I suspect that would work better if the officers the candidate algorithms were there but yeah I mean I did it was the case then yeah and it seemed like you would be worse or even like spicing yeah I should say as author of one of the candidate on my favorite you should be hmm it\u0027s a good suggestion we can think about that it kind of isn\u0027t possible to do that without a standardized feedback mechanism which is what\u0027s going on at abt core so you kind of [Music] I mean this is hackathon I\u0027m not shipping code right but I mean certainly we\u0027ve got we\u0027ve got a candidate feedback mechanism in a wiki core and so you know we could look we can I mean part of the point of this is to see whether this really works before we sanitize it I mean this could even be one of the topics to see if we can integrate that with the candidates to see if it works yeah yep hmm thank you any other comments or questions if not we conclude early today so thank you all for coming and see you in module thank you shouting thank you it is module next time "
