This is a research group that is part of the IRTF and today we're going to be having kind of a short session because to all of the speakers were not able to make it for this time, but we were going to actually have them in the next IETF. So just as a reminder for everybody, please note that this session is being recorded and eventually the videos are going to be uploaded to YouTube And just to start on the usual part, that obviously, we are in the third date of the ATF, so probably you already saw all of this note well so please note it very well. And here are the two mandatory slides on that. Prior to actually study the meeting itself, I would like to really either someone in the room or in the chat if there will be the person taking note So do we have like a volunteer for that?

It is an absolute power it is delegated, it is not just generally revocable, particularly by the participants in the community. And in enforcement occurs essentially through the digital equivalence of censorship or exile.

You're a guest in my house. That was the kind of social logic that got, kind of imprinted on these networks and got written in how the software was developed An assumption that if somebody is able to unplug the server, you know, they have a kind of absolute power over that system and therefore all the tools built in to enable them to better run their systems, we're built in with the assumption that that's sysadmin was a source of absolute power. This logic began in these kind of informal communities was developed as a sort of convenience replicated the structure of the server itself, replicated the structure of the permission systems of the computers that these systems were running on. And so it was all kind of an extension of convenience And yet this is the logic that ends up spreading to the biggest social networks. As we move from a world in which the social world communities are being run and somebody's out of a computer in somebody's house to one in which they're being run by some of the largest corporations in the world This logic stuck.

Du Bois, and his concept of abolition democracy or or or or James particularly in his essay, Every Cook can govern it was an anti-colonial activist and writer in the mid-20th century And in this tradition, Robert Putnam is probably the major figure in political science.

I was struck as I was wrestling with this problem in my 500-person email list with conversations with my mother where she was telling me about the guard Club that she had just been elected president And she shared with me the bylaws of that garden And I realized at that moment that I had never been in an online community with such robust forms of self-governance as her garden club. So I began to think of the challenge that we find ourselves in as how can we catch up our online? communities with my mother's garden club? Could you change please? please? So one approach to this kind of challenge is to begin with the communities themselves We can start to bend over backwards with our communities to try to figure out how do we how do we to different kinds of governance structure This is something I've done a lot in my practice, both in large scales, like for instance at the top I was part of an initiative to do a shareholder proposal"

We had to set up another you know, a wiki in order to manage our documents. We had to set up a whole bunch of different spaces just in order to practice a little bit of basic democracy in how we operated, a relatively small small space. I looked also to communities that are trying to figure out how to do collective governance online today. One such context is that of blockchains. This is one space where actually the structure of the network has changed No longer are we relying on the assumption that a service is built out of a central server, but instead the value proposition is that you have to have some kind of distributed control of a particular current or organization built on top of it.

If you're even thinking about it, stop. And I think that's really telling, again, about how much the deep defaults built into our online systems are designed against the kind of self-governance that people actually might need to do in the world that the systems that we've come to rely on do not allow, for instance the kind of customization, the kind of crafting that we need in order to solve collection problems Could you turn, please? So I think we need to think about turning how we approach the relationship between democracy and our online networks upside down in particular we need to stop thinking about democracy and the internet as separate, right? What is the Internet doing to democracy? We hear that question a lot What should democracy do to the internet?

So first with technologies, I think it begins as this group begins with recognizing that protocol design has consequences for political and social life. And by protocol I think of that, you know, I think of protocols in a really broad way. I think of protocols in terms of technical protocols, but also recognize that it's not an accident, that's something like the Kyoto Protocol is also called protocol. These are voluntary agreements among agents. And also, I've been really interesting in the way in which protocol is a term that has been used by many indigenous communities that have lost access to state or do not have access to state power to describe systems of and flow of power among them and to recognize that we need the power to design our technological lives much more carefully and creatively than we have been allowed to so far That this is a game we should all be getting into In MediGov, we've developed a framework that we call module politics, an approach to design digital systems that enable composable and highly flexible forms of governance design.

I argue that a big part of the challenge is to recognize the way in which we're built on we're working with legal and financial forces driving the development of our technical systems that encourage and in some ways compel us into forms of centralized control So it is important to develop forms of democratic governance into our tools but actually the moments where this has occurred have arisen in moments where external structures of power have actually invited that. So for instance, I mentioned earlier, the rise of blockchains as one example of a space where there's been a tremendous influx of interests and activity and investment designing online governance And this is because the nature of the networks changed and the flows of money in those networks changed Another example of this I think is really important is cases where governments, like, for instance, the city of Barcelona, has been a really leading one, have actually stepped out and said, we want to allow the power to flow differently in our community And Barcelona for instance, sponsored the development of decedum, which is a platform that enables this kind of modular politics.

You know, this could look like rethinking something like Section 230, around how accountability flows around online systems. Maybe if they're more democratically governed that allows you know, the companies that host those communities to defer accountability away from themselves it also means in enabling things like worker organizing among, among workers, among people who are creators on these platforms so that they can really have a collective voice Often the law actually prevents people who are working in online content from organizing and developing"

Why can't we, or organize and come together? And often there is a law or another kind of structural constraint that prevents us from being able to even begin the conversation about collective governance and online spaces. And this extends to the hardware as well. You know, in Colorado, where I live, we have, you know, some of our community are fortunate enough to have, for instance, rural electric cooperatives that have deployed really, really high quality broadband internet. This works super well. In the community where I'm in, it's a it's a tech hub, Boulder, Colorado, but we have terrible internet service compared to rural communities miles and miles away from us that have these electric cooperatives. And so our owning and governing already the fiber that they rely on So there are lots of different approaches to thinking about this but I think it depends on rethinking our policy strategies from, again, using democracy as a cudgel against the internet and toward using democracy as a tool for problem solving Can you turn to the next slide?

And I wonder if that isn't connected to the other concept of permissionless innovation where, you know, the internet was kind of designed as like well you can come along if you want to if you speak these protocols you can be on the network and then that's kind of it And I kind of implicit in that feels like it isn't working out you can always leave or or go to another network and I feel like that fractal of exit kind of goes all the way down So maybe one of the reasons, one of the challenges I think to thinking about governance at this lower protocol layer, It's why I think we're not really grabbing onto how governance happens down down of the challenges I think to thinking about governance at this lower protocol layer. It's why I think we're not really grabbing onto how governance happens down here, other than obviously in the IETF And then the other challenge I feel like is something that we face a lot in HRC which is like there aren't a lot of humans like real end user humans talking protocols and invisible in these lower layers protocols. So there isn't a lot of opportunity to either get meaningful consent, you know, in a case of privacy issues or other kinds of things for this crop up. So not a question for you, but I think it really pulls together two threads that you've been discussing in terms of why is why does it feel so hard to practice governance? or to invite governance by people at the protocol layer, even though we would like that for proliferating democracy, etc Oh, yeah, thank you I mean, there's so much there.

We tend to have an online space And it feels very cool. It feels very powerful. I get to post a tweet and it can go viral right? I can be heard and like, you know, the powerful will quit right?

And it may be an interesting study case, but we agreed that week that we were going to try to form a working group to fix what has happened in terms of the, what some would call toxic, I would call cruel approach that we have towards when we have somebody that needs to be expelled from a list or have their posting rights blocked So first of all, I'd invite you onto the the mod discuss list to perhaps share some points of view, but more to the point, I think one of the questions we need to do grapple with is, you know, too much democracy in some cases or? are we using our voices wrong in this?"

One of my great heroes, Coralenaida Emke, you know, fought hard for that and a lot of open source communities, as have many others. But one issue that Coraline Nail I always talk about around this is that a lot of those codes of conduct don't actually specify the enforcement mechanisms in the due process. I think that's the next phase phase Hi, I'm vittorio bertola, and I have a personal word of caution. I like your ideas, but I think that one thing is if you try to apply them to small niche communities of informed people like some of the blockchain ones, like the IETF could be a different thing is if you try to then apply the principle to master social media for moderation or these kind of things and I'm saying this because you made me feel younger, because your second last slide was exactly the police platform that 20 years ago across Europe was pushed back the wave of pirate parties, including the online democracy. And so in Italy, I was part of that. The Italian incarnation was something called the Five Star Movement I don't know if you ever heard about it and I was one of its early leaders coming from digital rights activism. And this, when we start we were really, like, if you learned people that really liked the ideas and it worked great. It was really I mean a new form of citizenship, like you said, and people started to join, and we were discussing community-owned utilities But then, when we started actually to grow, I engaged worked great. It was really, I mean, a new form of citizenship, like you said, and people started to join, and we were discussing community-owned utilities. But then, when we started actually to grow and gain success, and we got substantial percentages of all votes at the election, then the average people came.

No, let's just blame the African immigrant And so people started to blame the African immigrants So that's what happened. And it ended up becoming the worst form of populism, racism So you have to be very careful. So I don't think that this can easily work for a mass environment. Because if you did that today on Facebook, I think the result would be that like the anti-vaxers, flat-outers, whatever you want to call that would be the biggest or at least the most organized and vocal group and will take over the moderation. And that's what we would do get. Yeah, thank you. I mean, there's so much in that. First of all, you know, I take a lot of, I've learned a lot about the kind of tools you need to enable shared ownership from italy and part of that begins with the Italian Constitution, which has a right to cooperation written into it and and backing that up Italy has one of the most robust structures for enabling the financing of share ownership and resultantly has one of the most vibrant cooperative sectors in the world. We were a quasi-communist country What's that? We were an almost communist country But it wasn't just that. I mean, one of the great to me, one of the most important aspects of that history is it was both the the the communists and the Catholics who, you know, who did that And so coming from two different directions the on the point about about mass participation I think that's it's so right.

I was just wondering, just couple of thoughts there, especially for instance in the public sector, there's often the talk that folks need to be upskilled on the technology side. Should there be the reverse being done in the corporation side of being upscale? from a human rights perspective or? various ethical aspects as less in some sense as a necessary aspect of our work? because the implications of our work go there but we're not necessarily always trained right so that's i don't know if you have thoughts on that um i was also wondering if there are elements in this kind of framework as to like for instance through the impact assessments in the loop diagram where you decide, okay, we just don't develop the technology technology Yes. Okay. Yeah, it's in that paper reference. If there are many iterations,"

We shouldn't be in I would say illusion that I will learn all the necessary things and solve my problem. It's really a collaborative effort we are after, I would say Thanks so much. Thanks you so much, Ali. It was really wonderful Thanks, Sophia. Yes, so thank you everyone for a attending this session. There's no more our speakers, so we're going to close the room at that So thank you very much for being in the room And we see each other, hopefully, at the next IETF So thank you, see Thank you I have to do it you Thank you very much"
