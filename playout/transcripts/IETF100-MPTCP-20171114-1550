    "text": "in question Stuart Cheshire from Apple I have one little comment about the presentation you use and this is something many many people do you use the word performance as meaning the same as throughput as if the only performance we care about in networking is is bulk transfer of large files and there are other kinds of performance that matter so on one of your slides you said that using the path with the minimum RTT gives very poor performance but if you want is very low latency the minimum RTT is great performance and one example of one of the things we use multipath TCP for at Apple is Siri voice interaction and we use it because we want very low latency so so in that case now the performance we care about is not the most throughput if that\u0027s a high delay link we\u0027d rather have the lowest delay link so it\u0027s just a comment maybe use the word throughput rather than performance because performance ought to mean many different things depending on the application yeah thank you yeah here we only consider this reboot the performance yeah and and many people do whenever you hear marketing numbers of bad performances better they always mean throughput and that\u0027s why I\u0027m trying to clarify that I think we as an industry focus far too much on throughput is the only thing that matters thank you since Hal from Hawaii so to your question so agree we would probably use the throughput is better for destruct and for the costing of me RTD actually we use kill use me Rd T as the schedule for the multipath segregation so in the special case morality is not only for to decrease the latency of the application flow but also in such cases of the discrepancy or two links it also can help to increased throughput when the two paths really you know different from children two months yes so I just I hope you didn\u0027t sound like I was criticizing the work because that was not my intent I was just I wanted to make the point because it comes up a lot that that people very easily fall into the trap of thinking only about throughput one of the reasons is because throughput is easy to measure you run iperf and see what number it says and sometimes because it\u0027s easy to measure and and the home users go to speedtest.net to see how fast their internet connection is and only the really smart ones know that the round-trip delay matters as well so speaking for Apple we don\u0027t care one bit about increasing "

    "text": "early data when making token requests next slide please so the server so the proxy applies with token window advertisement basically it contains two integers the window base and the window size the window base is the first talk usable token the window size is basically the number of tokens that the client can use so for example the base is 10 and the size is 3 that means that the client can use the tokens number 10 11 and 12 so next slide please so once a client has some tokens to spend it can start spending them on requests so the client should include the token expenditure and as part of its request and the software basically sends back an expenditure reply as part of the operation reply and an optional window advertisement in case the window has changed so next slide please so the token expenditure is straightforward it just contains the token that the client is trying to spend clients should obtain to spend the tokens in order the next slide please you\u0027re not seeing this right mmm I can see it now so the token expenditure reply includes a response code if the token was was out of window or if or if the proxy had already seen the token then then the token is basically rejected and the operation fails the next slide please proxies can unilaterally increment the window base that basically that basically happens whenever so that so clients don\u0027t have to request don\u0027t have to put in window requests in order to get more tokens so for example the Claire the client has spent its first 110 tokens this the proxy\u0027s is free to shift the windows and positions to the left also if the client ends up spending higher-order tokens the proxy can decides to shift the window past the gaps it has left in the in the token space as to not to create any problems and generate new usable tokens for the client so exciting so we\u0027re gonna we\u0027re gonna focus more on "
