    "text": "yeah it looks it looks we were a little bit messy to focus but i'm trying to clarify that when we talk about 5g slicing the 5g is a kind of term which is technology agnostic instead of only focus on wireless so according to the 5g slicing components it's composed by the the run segment the core segment and transport segment and the itf network class was trying to focus on the transport side and ota is a part of that so so we don't have to directly link the otm or otn slides to 5g slides but that is definitely a part in the transport uh it can be called domain or or some network uh in the as a 5g slice components and within the transport network it's the the degree of freedom is dependent on okay the the current operator's choice on the switching from layer 0 to layer 3 which to which to choose and it's free to combine the all the current switching technologies of course ldn is one of the options that's all i'm trying to say okay okay do you want to conclude the the presentation we have one minute left yeah so i think i have just one or two um so yeah the the same uh arguments applies to the abstract topology as"
