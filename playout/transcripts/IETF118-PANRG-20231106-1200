From from the network, from a path, and this is a a work in collaboration with Cisco and and also in the case of telephonic cases of framing in in a as part of a European project that is focusing on, energy efficiency topics. Which is called c screen, the the project. So, next slide, please. So the motivation of of this, of this work is to find ways of providing visibility of the energy consumption that could have in a in a network path So, thinking around a scenario where we have, original destination that could be multiple paths for for serving the the traffic of, a given plane. You know, flow. So the lead will be to determine what is the the energy that we can, allocate on how to that particular customer or or or use heartless sake. Or in in general terms, but is the the the energy consumed in a in a given path. So, So that could be this this possibility of allocating per throughput. I, we know we are not knowledgeable of the discussions in the but at least about the the possibility of allocating energy in terms of throughput bank with the consumer. So we are following that discussion. The the initial idea will be that not to determine what is the energy that can be allocated to to one given surveys, let's say, So with the with that, we started to define a very basic API right now. So we we intend to to improve that for sure. So it's, yeah, an initially, attempt So we are using well known architectures or RESTful APIs and and schemas, the open API schema And I said it's very simple, simplistic by now, but we we intend to"

So this information or API could be consumed either a stimulus. So for instance, we we put here the the case of SD is the one customer. Because it's the the the, you know, the the initial idea that we had in mind, but also could be done, we could be consumed internally. The thinking on, automation purposes from the operator if we want to move flows from who can consolidate flows, maybe in these cycles of the night and these kind of things. Also can be consumed by by other entities in the, internal to the operator for doing that kind of optimization. Next, please. So the the rationale behind this idea of visibility of energy, was, we, we assumed to 2 assumptions. The first one is the the the energy consumption in that device. Transportional baseline, component, which is independent of the traffic So it's due to the processors, to the funds, to the chassis, the cars and and so on so far, but there is another component in the energy consumption is dependent of the traffic volume. Right? So, we put there a a reference there in this a paper, you can see an analysis is, done in in that, direction. And basically the in in that paper and data analysis, there is a, a variable consumption of energy, depending on the of the volume or the traffic, which is somehow linear. Model in a as a linear, coming to him, graph, let's say. So with with that, and and basically, the conclusions of this paper. More or less will be that the 80% is the is consumed by the baseline and 20% will be that variable consumption. So being that the case, the or a second assumption is, okay, by now, probably we can simply optimize that 20% of the the consumption, but maybe in the future, the devices were able to implement mechanisms for going in a sleep mode or switch off guards or these kind of things, probably we can also"

It doesn't move this kind of things. So this is probably not feasible today, but, we expect that could be feasible in the future. Next, please. Mhmm. So going to the to the point. So, essentially, what we, consider is that we have on consumer or some consumer of the API. That will interact with our network from them. This could be a, a network controller. It could be any other, control management component that could create let's say, a good leverage on on this information for gateway consumption map, And the idea would be to retrieve the information of the consumption from the devices from the different, devices that are somehow, enabling the the different paths. The idea that we have, what we are doing right now is to collecting the information from the from the transceivers. So we can regime to destination to determine consumption of the of the transceivers plus the consumption of the chassis the or the different uh-uh the routers in the in the middle. The very basic APIs, as you can see at the bottom on on on your left, So the query is source, IP, destination IP, and the throughput for the for the traffic. And the response is the watts per gigabit. With the throughput of this or how, optional. So if you're gonna include the throughput, you get the the overlap, the full, let's say, consumption in the path. Next, please. So just for finishing the the presentation, this is an additional work that they will be to collect it from the, from the research group, sorry, for the typo and and checking the the interest if it's be interested or not of energy.

The 3 main components are, the data forwarding takes place, control plane, where you have the inter domain routing and where the paths are, discovered.

So a bit more about the practice because sign is not only a theory, but it's really also used today. Let next slide, please. So now I want to give you short to design control plane, next slide. The control plane is about infidomain routing. It consists of 3 processes. One process is the exploration or the beaconing where, valid pass, are discovered, and this happens with so called, beacons. Then AS is select past segments and make them available to other ASs this is the registration process. And in the resolution process, an endpoint, who wants to communicate with another endpoint looks up, past segments and combine some into an, and went off, which is added to the packet header. The first two processes, sorry, are, formed by the control services, which Each stay as has an assigned control service, and this is one of the, of this is the main infrastructure elements. Of sign"

So a little bit more about the past exploration, how does it happen? It happened by core ASs who periodically sent, path construction beacons, yeah, away. On their way. We have this inter ISD core beaconing is between, core ASs, and this Deepgram helps to find valid paths between core ASSs. Both within bum, ISD and also between different ISTs. And then there is also the intra ISD beaconing, wherein core AS sends Beacons, top down to its child ASs and their past passes, spell it pass between core and child ASSR at covered within one IST. Per propagation periods, each AS also propagate the beacons it received to other, to its neighboring, Aass's, And, these PCBs accumulate demographic, information about, cryptocraftically protected information about pass and forwarding. And this is more or less the key content of one PCP as it includes an initiation time stamp, expiration time, ID, the list of all the A assets with it, it passed so far on the past. This, routing information is signed. And, there is also an announcement of possible peer links. This graphic shows us a little bit the process in a very simple way. You see on top of the core a, SSA and B in these, ISD and that, the PCB starts, is to send away down like, from a toc to f. On its way. It accumulates information about the ASIS, the ASS is passes"

Each, AS is free to, use the select criteria and algorithm, it's think suits, this a as best. And it is the beacon has happened to stop down, but, past segments can also be traversed, a bottom up So this, reversion of past segment is possible. Ops segments, are those segments that this is the way an AS wants to reach its own core AS down cost segments are a segment which, is the way ASs won't to be reached by other ASs. Up power segments are stored at, the AS's own control service. And the down cost segments are which is connected with the specific AS. So you also can see this on the in the graph this, ASF It's, stores at its own control servers, the past segment FCA. It's an up past segment and this is how it wants to communicate with the core AS it is, connected to. But it's registered. The downpaul segment ADF control servers of the core AS because this is, the past it wants to, how it wants to be reached by other ASs. Next slide And the personal solution is done where, an endpoint who wants to commune communicate with another endpoint, looks up path segments and then combines them in an end to end pass. The looking up takes place in the control plane, the combining of path segments in an end to end pass and then putting this pass information in the"

An up past segment, a core past segment, and a down past segment, So the OPPA segment is to connect with, the own core AS the core segment is, if the destination AS does not share, core AS with source AS, and then you have you need some core segment to communicate with this other core AS and the downcast segment is to reach the destination errors from the court. Down from the core. So this is also, you can see this again in the graphic, there's endpoint in ASF forms to communicate with endpoint in ASH. It needs, for this, it needs an upper segment FCA to its own core AS, then it needs a core, segment, from the core ASR to core ASB, and then there is it needs an down power segment from to to communicate with, endpoint vaccination endpoint age. And, it is, how do you say it is to reduce latency, it's endpoint shoots a cash, return path segments, and they also should send these request part segment in parallel. So so this, looking up for cost segments happens in the control lane, Now, the combining them to end to end pass happens in a data plane, an an extra light, please. So here is an overview slide of the data plane. The data plane is where sign, forwards these, backups between inter domain packers between ASs.

And these hop fields are, authenticated with the so called message authentication codes to prevent forgery. AS has used their own secret key to authenticate these work fields. And this hope this NEC must be checked by the border of the sign routers, on the way. And they should only forward packages package, which are, explicitly authenticated. And so there's also the graphic shows just a little bit that border out of design routers are on the edge of ASs And they so what they have to do during the forwarding is just to access access the next hope in the packet header verify the authenticity of the Mac And then if everything is okay, just forward the package. So there is no need anymore for or no longer need for inspect thing, the destination addresses and forwarding tables and so on. Here, you also see a very complex, illustration of assigned packets. Each signed packet, the sign header in the packet, the packet header consists of a meta header which gives some general information about the assigned pass, then, info fields, which give information about the different past segments. And then hope fields which is where is hope field represents at the in one AS on the costs. And also maybe interesting to, to to show or to tell you is that the intra domain routing within an AS is just is based on existing mechanisms. So there you do not have change anything if you want to use sign. Here is a bit more in detail. The sign header specification it the design packet header consists of a common header address header."

And that the address header then defines these addresses in more detail. The pass header is then which contains the really the full AS level forward wherein pass. And that is where we want to have a a little bit a look a little bit more teachers look. Into So that's the next slide. So this is the overview of this pass header, and this consists, as I already mentioned, paths make the header, which indicates the currently valid, path segment info fields. Also to go and leave that it's hope field. So that's, the routing knows where we are currently on the on the way through the internet. And then it also defines the number of hop fields per segment. Then there are 3 up to 3 info fields. This number depends on how many past segments were needed to to combine this pass, and this info field contains basic information about the of segments. There are up to 64 hop fields where each hub op field to be present in AS, to the past, and that are, as I already said, authenticated with this Mac. The next slide, please. So how is such as, parts, constructed? As as as I already told, endpoint in communicate with an endpoint in ASH.

You need 2 core you need a core segment if the destination and the source, as to not share, a core, this is shown by the, upper illustrations to upper graphics. If the source and destination do share, a core ASU have you only need, you do not need, core segment with just an up and down segment.

And then sometimes also when they share, they both share an an AS on a higher level, can make shortcuts and it's even possible, of course, that they are both on the same pulse. Next slide. So what do we think are advantages of this, sign design choice. First, it gives, control and transparency over the following pass to the endpoints. It also offers inter domain multi pass. It also enables past authorization and it simplifies, packet processing at the routers because just have to access the next hop in the packet header hop field. And there is no, no need for Lomas Preethic matching on IP addresses anymore. And, what is also important is you can just reuse the intradomain routing protocols and the infrastructure"

First is the PCPs, they are signed in an onion fashion in order to avoid pass hijacking and splicing. So every AS, on the road can verify route routing messages by following the specific change. This this is in the control plane. Then you have this hope, I hope, pass authorization based on this Mac which is, used in the data plane. The, as I already said, the router should check these max by during forwarding and only forwards the the packages with, verified authorized max. The deceased. And then, the roots of trust in sign are ISDscoped So there is it is very there's almost no global kills which possible in a way because if One ISH compromised and the others can still function.

My part. Thank you very much. Maybe There are questions now? If there are clarification questions, I think for the the discussion, we wanna hold that for later until we've seen all Yeah. So Doug Montgomery Do you envision isolation domains to be roughly proportional to maybe the number of tier ones today, the number of ASs rough and and can that concept be recursive. Can there be isolation domains inside of isolation domains. The last thing I nothing is open. Is it possible? No. But So the the size of an isolation domain, isolation domains are usually, how do you say that, and how can I say it? They are built, It's a logical it should be a logical, have a logical boundary like, maybe, nationality or, that how do you call this a vertical industry, How do you call this? Corporation at this.

It by the complete sign or see the gentleman saying no no. So, you know, the answer, I guess. Yeah. Less than maybe. Nicola, the other, draft other So the secret is per AS So each AS has its own secret that is used for this message that authentication codes. And this AS wide. Okay. And how can you exchange then the shared secret among the AS? Is it a need for doing this? This is not shared because the AES is using this secret to to authenticate the messages when it does the route discovery process in the control plane.

I was wondering on on slide 7, you mentioned timestamps for the PCBs, what kind of requirements for time synchronization protocols do you have?

So is there any issues if you have for many call is is because you are saying that your use flood the information of the PCB, the change, the so in principle, quariances are not meant to be, like, a a huge amount within an ISD, and that's why the the routing process is really split into this, core and core to leave process I think in existing departments, usually there's a handful of Corey S's in in an ISD.

So, The idea is that this, this max are, change. So at HES, What is meant is also the incoming and outgoing interface. So for this kind of house splicing to happen, you would need to have a series of polluting ASs.

I don't think space use case, which is super high delay was considered to be honest, So I think we would need to explore that. But the idea is that you need loose time synchronization.

Design Internet ecosystem is not surprisingly, looks like an internet. Right? You have on the one hand design backbone, design backbone is a community of network service providers that deploy sign routers. Basically, think of design routers as kind of waypoints on sign end to end paths and you join the sign internet by applying these signed routers and peering them with other signed routers.

But in practice, everything that uses a sign network or such as an IP gateway. I come I come to that a bit more. Come in different flavors. They can be physical on prem network appliances. Can be virtual routers in the cloud. That can also be take the form of a carrier grade sign IP gig waiver, basically, nice p runs, distributed sign IP gateway for its for example, residential customers, Right? And then design applicator is they're the ones that get the pass from the network, choose the pass based on whatever policy you give them, meaning you can do such things like your fencing. Take only paths that never leave the European Union, for example. Of course, they also have a notion of what network performance you get on a path and then they can optimized for different network performances. Next slide. So isolation domains, we have heard it before. Sign is actually logically a network of interconnected isolation domains. Right? Each isolation domain has a core, which are and to come to that question from before. Chorus's are roughly the tier 1 providers in an area. Not the global tier 1 providers in the internet today.

And in it, and in it, you have things like, the policy who is a courier that isolation domain and who are also the root certificates for the entire PKI because the isolation may defines the root of trust. Importantly, each, AS, each line AS, whether it's a Chorus or ordinary sign a s, needs needs assign AS certificate isolation it can be part of multiple isolation domains, but per isolation domain an AS needs an AS certificate. And that's the certificate authorities of an isolation domain kind of have a form of access control who can be part of an isolation domain and who cannot and maybe also to to previous question, we envision roughly one isolation, domain per country. For geographical region. And then a whole lot of special purpose isolation So think a little bit like top level domains in in DNS. The country specific ones, Those would be kind of the default isolation domains. And then there will be, a range of industry specific bonds or purpose different purposes. And we'll see 2 examples. Next slide. So how do you bootstrap in an isolation domain? You need to define governance. You need to define who is the voting members the voting members are the ones that signed that PRC who are the certificate authorities because those rule certificates need to be part of the TRC.

Operating in isolation, and depending on use case, you need you need to consider whether it is overhead is actually warranted or not. Then assign yes in practice, what does it What does it contain? Mostly sign routers. Which implement design control and data plane that you have heard before. So, neurologists today, I run on standard off the shelf hardware, hardware, reason for that is because we don't have a big tech vendor that creates custom silicon for it. But we actually also don't necessarily need that. Because forwarding and sign is not as long as prefix metric matching that needs TCAM. But it's actually this MAC computation, right, which is an AS computation, which is actually hardware accelerated on all commodity platforms nowadays and then optionally assign AS can deploy design IP gateways. Such that IP only end hosts or IP only applications can still make use of this of sign of assigned network. And crucially, all of these infrastructure components, they are put on top of an existing IP backbone. Right? So signed packets use an IP underlay to to forward or to communicate between the different signed routers or sign notes. This was a very deliberate decision. That we can reuse as much of the existing infrastructure, which is IP based, obviously, as possible. Next slide. How do we become such as sign s, Well, you need to install Sun routers.

It's important to say, to mention at this point that sign ASNs are different from VGP assets. Right? Those are 2 different name spaces. Our current numb numbering practice, however, is that we kind of reserve the entire reach ASN space. And if you already have a VGP AS number, and you would like to join design space, then we would give you the same AS number. That you already have. But does need to be.

Want to be part of multiple ones. For example, a country specific one and and and the banking specific one, you will need to get an AS certificate from both. You have that, can then set up your signed hearings. That, of course, then depends on the business relationship. So with other network service providers that are equal on the hierarchy will your will set up peering, core hearings or sign peering links, and otherwise you set up parent child relationships.

Currently this is how 99 percent off sign traffic is is being consumed today. It's IP, tunneled, and sign traffic. At least on the productive, sign network. I've been signed telling is is very standard as you can imagine you're all natural professionals here. You take an IP packet. Encapsulate in the sign packet You send it through the same network, and on the other end, it gets decapsulated. And for the hosts, involved in this data transfer, it's actually completely transparent that they're using a a sign network. I still want to work you through a very brief example. Of IP sign tunneling. So here you have 2 ASs that want to communicate. With each other, 6410164102. 64 is the highest the identifier. In this case, and 101 is, a notation for a sign a s number. And we have these 2 end hosts dot 100 in the subnets that want communicate, by design network. They don't speak sign. Of course. That's the setup. Next slide. First, we will have to sign IP gateway that basically through, a routing protocol, here. Clients, that, 196 1921682. Slash 24 is actually in this AS 64102. Right? Right? I don't want to go into detail how this works, but it has this routing table, and it it announces that, for example, via VGP into the internal network and also the static routing can be any kind of internal routing protocol.

That has a packet path policy avoid one AS or avoid the other AS. I mean, it's completely made up, but you get you get the So it will match this one. It will see that this packet that was sent out actually has this, priority marking. So it will be part of this priority. Traffic class, it will use the path policy avoiding, a s 103. Next slide.

So you can also control from which networks you want to be reachable. So if you have a service that is geographically limited by nature. You can actually use that on the network level to limit access on the network to your service, right, And this is not a firewall that then block filters based on geo blocking.

And I think standardization would even further support the growth of this ecosystem and and the acceptance of the technology. We have signed is that is being used for mission critical deployments. So we do for example, Swiss interbank clearing, which is the most critical application in the Swiss Sciences an oversized network, And, of course, the users of that network, they're asking for, okay, what's the long term future off sign. And part of that is definitely also start an intersection. We need more independent implementations. There's a open source implementation, and then there is another pyre implementation builds on top of the open source implementation there needs to be more of that. Cannot just be 1 commercial and 1 open source. Also we need to go to the native, bring sign natively to the end host, right, that we can move away from IP and sign tunneling.

So you see these settlements, all you cannot read this from to fall back, but, it's gonna be into slide deck. You have this actual structure on the, that you combine. So this is the policy that you agree upon and you expressed this agreement by actually signing this content. Next slide. So here's the, you know, the basic steps So you need to collect this material. You verify this, that it's really what every party is actually supposed to bring to the table, then it's really there. And and, accurate, And then you agree on the necessary required parameters the ones that we indicated above. So everybody needs to give consent. You then generate the payload to combine these the this material to a structured container you do the signing process, which each individual party is doing on their own. And then you combine these signatures, I create the final TRC container and then you disseminate out to the network. Next slide. So the first SFN ISD has been created in in November, 2020 months. So roughly 2 years ago, And we have set the validity period to 309 5 days in order to create some overlap. And not to run into the festive season. And so we renewed successfully in 2022 2023.

We know that it's it's just limited. You know, it's, what we did is a lighthouse implementation. We just demonstrated how it could work and that it could work. But we need to see more bigger companies network software companies picking up that lead and implementing the science software And the ISPs need to come along and then pick up the adoption and and create some services. We need some operational authorities for numbering. We need some global governance this is partially addressed by the science association, but it could be, of course, there could be more to it.

Well, I think, other speakers already mentioned, just to summarize, I think with Zion, we have some concrete deployment experience. And, yeah, I was happy that today we could, also showcase, the current productive deployments. We have, 2 main implementations, one proprietary from Anapaya, 1 open source, there is even a proprietary PKI, which, We haven't really, talked about and there's a growing selling community. And, so we believe that Cyon can fill in gaps in, several areas where where I think more work is needed, especially when it comes to routing security, to inter domain, pass our networking, now there's also this, concept of trust enhanced networking.

So have you metered the data plan for wordings performance, before and after your deployment. I mean, if I wanna be assigned a s, and install, sign routers, will the data plan forwarding be compromised and how can I do to mitigate that influence so you're gonna take it? Yeah. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I think if you, as an AES, adopt sign, you will be for a long time an IP enzyme provider. And everything that is not sign, you will handle with your existing infrastructure, and there should be no impact at all. Right? In terms of forwarding performance, assign, routers, as I as I mentioned before, we run this, commodity server grade hardware. Right? And the most expensive operation is actually an AS computation to verify this MAC we see in our implementation, which is, which builds on top of DPDK, we can get to numbers as 10,000,000 packets per second per core.

First off, so the the, the first presentation and and the session was actually about reducing energy consumption in networking, but you're talking about an awful lot of signing and and signature verification operations here. So even in light of your 10,000,000 packets per How are we doing on energy efficiency with us? That's actually a very good question. So the signing and signature verification aspect. That is controlling only. And you don't do that per packet. Right? You do that on a path lookup when you when you look when I look up, a set of paths to my destination, I maybe get a dozen and then I verify half segments, and that's a couple of, signature verifications, of course, but then I use those 10 paths for 6 hours, let's say. So that's really get gets amortized. Okay. So maybe I don't understand, actually, what happens on each packet forwarding operation. So on it, so there's a difference between, digital signatures being used on control plane that design a path segment. Each individual AS on a path signs its entry on that path with its own, certificate private key and, corresponding, certificate can be used to verify that, right, in that you have this hop field information that is actually the thing that gets put onto the data plane. And in that hop field, you have a message authentication code that is only used by that AS to verify the packet then on the data plane. But that is using, symmetric cryptography because it does not need to be shared with anybody. So what you do is then, you use AES to verify that MAC data plane. And that's what I"

We do need to verify that the header entry is correct and not forced. And that is done with symmetric cryptography. And all the asymmetric cryptography is It's just on the control plane. Now to energy efficiency, there is actually a paper by the research group at atdth. And they try to model and analyze, and compare energy consumption assigned router with, an IP router and, well, of course, it makes some assumptions about energy comes up consumption of TCAM and energy consumption of CPUs and whatnot. And the outcome was that sign can be on a per packet basis more energy efficient because AS is cheaper than longest prefix match. Okay. If I given this is the theoretical result, course, the practice, you know, remains Okay. Can I go can I go one more Sure? Okay. So, let's see. One of the key points in in the overall scion effort is is really security. Right? You didn't talk about a lot about how cyan fits with other security mechanisms at at We mentioned naming a minute ago, but but also, you know, TLS or application level things as well as physical layer of security where you might be I don't know, you know, loss or or or power transmission in the fiber or something to detect physical tapping of fibers and like that. How do how do they fit together? No. Actually, I thank you for that I think it's, It's a very good question.

We we we asked ourselves, how what can we do to create an inter domain secure routing protocol given a greenfield approach. Now that's a little bit of history. But out of it came a sign. The other part of security is really where where sign focus on is is the availability aspect. Right? Because security usually you talk about it as a triangle. Confidentiality integrity and availability, and confidentiality and integrity, of course, you get through encryption and authentication. That's let's say kind of a solve problem, but then availability is usually quite hard to to achieve, and and Cyan tries with its path based, Network, where paths are individually secured, of course. To provide this guaranteed availability on the network level granted with some extensions on top of sign that you would still need to to get that in also stances. Right? But even the baseline as is described in the drafts, today with the traffic, hijacking prevention, the immediate path failover into the main path failure can give you a lot of availability guarantees and, control who gets my path information who can even talk to me on a network level, gives you a lot of availability benefits and we talk about security, then we mean a routing security and b availability aspects of security.

First one is What have you learned in terms of the deployability and adoption of other overlay protocols and lists comes to mind as one that has maybe some of the similar challenges to you.

Do you want to take verse. When it comes to, learning from existing protocols, I think I would love to have more conversations with the list folks.

Let's say the you know, in this practice, routing locator and identifiers. And if you at the idea, I think we do the same because Zion does routing based on, this ISDAS topple, And then the end host address is, let's say, left outside of well, it is carried, but a sign unget header, but it's That's not what determines routing. So you have the same idea of routing locator and end host identifier. And I think we it it would be interesting the long term to see how the mapping, happens.

So from practice if we assume roughly know, an internet path is, I think, on average, 4 AS hops roughly, right? If you assume that would hold true in sign as well, or maybe it's 5 because we vector piece a bit more AS is actually in a full deployment. Plus the additional IP underlay that you still need. Right? Right now, sign is never directly on the layer 2, but it uses this the under day we're talking roughly about a 100 to 120 bytes per packet. Of course, if you have a 10 hop path, then this can go up to, you know, under an 82100 bytes. The two hub paths, and it's lower. But on average, we expect roughly 80 to a100 bytes for Alright. Yep. Thank you very much. Yeah, Ron. This is Katie. Yeah. Well, I mean, I like the idea that the the end system can actually choose path. Right?

Where the source can actually choose any path there might be through the network. Right? A sender actually gets a selection of paths that are, let's say, policy. That is clear. That is okay. So but in that path, creation So during past creation or past discovery, the ISP also has has a say of Okay. I want to to allow this hop from this ingress to this egress for this downstream customer. I know the the the policies are clear, but, I mean, it's What I meant is is more of the dynamic situation. So if if it's some ISPs that that that It's probably the say the the link to to one AS is more congested and just they want to shift the traffic to to another AS, then it's not possible, or do we have policies that are pushed to the let's say, to the systems. I mean, shim 6 had a very similar problem. Right? I mean, what today happens is, most senders in today's sign network or actually sign IP gateways. And they have a pretty good map or pretty good information about the performance characteristics, including drop rate, and latency and checker of each path. Right? Now if a link gets congested, that will lead to to, either increase jets latency or drop rates, then you would move away.

You can definitely shift away traffic from, a given interface or a given by revoking that interface. Although that is a bit a nuclear option because revoking means I will not let any more traffic through that. Right? Now As a final comment, there is their metadata, that arbitrary metadata that you can attach to sign Right? We use that, for example, to communicate, MTUs or, geographical locations of a lot of routers, in the future, it could be a price tag, Or that could also be a low tech because these costs are relatively frequently refreshed, you could include a load indicator in in that that would also be a signal for end nodes on the load of that link.

And and the packet making it back to you, and then you switch. So within Europe, right now, we see packet switching or half switching latencies of sub-ten milliseconds. Now to Australia, this will be a bit different. But that's that's the level of inter domain failure lower that you can expect. Okay. That's that's actually really interesting. That's actually even shorter than expected? How did how does it scale with the number of, connections that are actually potentially pass through that.

And now one of them actually gets revoked, so I don't need to recalculate anything. I can just basically, switch to something that I already know.

Just to be careful, right? I'm okay publishing him as I as independent submissions, but also having to adopt a few. Oh, okay. In order to allow the work to evolve. Got it. Something that you would want to entertain in this I'm asking I would certainly be open to that with my chair head on. I think that, like, again, we have sort of like our charter and then our set of questions, and we have a bunch of of evolving answers to those questions. Presented by this iron architecture that that makes sense to me."

I'm not sure that's not the same Honestly, like, if you put people who are who are very well versed in sort of the spaces and it's like, okay. I don't get how this works. That's not necessarily not a research question. Great. I'm also not sure that's the case, but we can have that discussion over a beverage of your choice, like the excellent coffee right behind that wall. So I This happened. Okay. Calling Comeriskity. So, yeah, I mean, this seems like a perfectly reasonable way forward. I would, maybe say that some of this is gonna get close to the IETF what Yep. Maybe you're gonna need some close cooperation with some of the ATF groups Sorry, Eric. You're not off the hook. A lot of this, I mean, yes, there's research questions here. But to make it work at scale, which is what you need, you're gonna have to have some some nice interactions with the people actually building products and cooperation significant operational experience. I think that we can start having that discussion here. Right? Like, one of the one of our research questions is And explicitly how do you operate networks like this? It's totally different from operation model. Yet. And it was for sure on the not only me and also my colleagues in drafting and security. Right? Visibility of the ATF. You can get me, but Finmax, Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, we have been inter interacting with several communities. One of the challenges that cyan is quite cross domain because, you know, it's PKI, control plane, data plane. That's why It was a bit of a a struggle for us. Right. So we've got, like, 21 seconds. I'm not gonna take a home."

And I don't know how many people are planning on going to Brisbane. But we can talk about schedule. I mean, like, you'll be there, obviously. We can talk about scheduling, subsequent meetings with more sign on content. That's Alright. Thank you all very much. Thank you for the scion, Joe, and we will see you at the next one of these wherever it happens to be. Most viewers. I didn't tell there was confidence. I'm not price."
