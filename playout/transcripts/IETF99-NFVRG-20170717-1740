    "text": "work you you presented is basically it quantified the flexibility as I like it is it separate performance criteria right so it that\u0027s and then for network resource allocation or function placement or any anything you want to call it the the idea is to basically come up with your objective function and then solve it right so that flexibility is just giving another dimension to the function right exactly fairness fairness is something that was measured well and then people define image finest criteria right so the questions that have you ever tried to do to combine that performance criteria with other performance criteria like cost right like operation cost or like capex or fairness for example and then come up with like a single problem optimization problem so we have discussed is that the question is yeah yeah it make is about aggregation yeah I think we had this before the flexibility definition is already quite complex as we see from the discussion here we have it in mind yeah you\u0027re thinking about it there\u0027s always these discussions how to combine it with reliability was not mentioned before for example yeah security and so on of course would be happy but that try first to go step by step in the project to give you a clearly shaped understanding of this flexibility but we have it in mind a particular the cost this is the most urgent thing where we are currently working on so how much time do you have left for the project to finish I know the second year of five years to report I\u0027m happy to report or it\u0027ll be instance it will be even worse I went to Brussels everyone more common general to AT\u0026T to throw another wrench in - your complexity I think part of the factors to consider for flexibility is legacy support versus you know greenfield I think it\u0027s a totally different or you know you can call it hybrid design versus you know new design that has a significant factor and in the end your problem you\u0027re trying to solve is there\u0027s a joke in the project management space where I can extrapolate it with like you can have you know you can have it fast flexible and cheap but you can only choose - right okay Jeff your closing no no no no you are the one closing so the proximity of our cloud placement is quite interesting and relatively new tournament but it\u0027s going "
