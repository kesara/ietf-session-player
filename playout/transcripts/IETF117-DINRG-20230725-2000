So thank you very much for having me today. It is an honor to address IETF and especially in a subject as important as this one, The talk today as you'll see maybe from the prospectus is about platform decay. And the platform is the endemic form of the Internet. but any intermediary sits in place of irresistible temptation. When you sit between end users and business customers that you have the power to shift value from both of them to your own shareholders. that acts as a kind of perennial gun on the mantelpiece in act 1. And after a couple of decades of lots and lots of platform growth, we are now in act 3. And that gun on the mantelpiece act one is going off with quite a deafening fuselage. We are in this moment of a very visible a highly contagious platform decay. from flop from Facebook and Instagram to Twitter and Twitch, to Reddit and Discord and beyond. And there's a signature pathology to platform decay, a a disease with a 3 stage procession. In the first stage of platform decay, you have firms that have lot of access to the capital markets, and they use that to generate and offer surpluses to end users. And even as they do that and make a hospitable place to lure end users in, They leverage technical economic and behavioral factors to lock those users in account readily leave. In stage 2, once the users are locked in, the the platform starts to withdraw some surpluses from them and starts to hand them over to business customers. It says to the business customers, not only have we got a a a rich and fertile place where you can come and find a lot of customers for your products and services but we're also gonna give you access to that at fire sale prices under very favorable conditions."

And then you reach the the end stage, stage 3, where the platform now having locked in business customers and end users begins to withdraw all available surpluses from both. and reallocating them to its own shareholders. And the idea here is to leap behind just enough residual platform value that both groups of users remain locked in and and don't just rush for the exits. And I call this process somewhat infamously in shitification, them. It's the process by which platforms start off as robust sites of value for both users and business customers But then in the end, turn into a pile of shit with no value for either. And and as a a use case here, I wanna talk about how Facebook proceeded because it's pretty canonical. So when Facebook started, it had a problem. Everybody who wanted to use social media already had an account on MySpace. The only people who are allowed to use Facebook were k to 12 in university students doteduaddresses, and it needed to lure those people off of my space and onto their platform. So Facebook gave them 2 pitches. the that to convince them to leave. The first was if you come to Facebook, we are only gonna show you the things that you ask us to show you. You show up here you articulate your social Tell us who matters enough to you that you wanna hear when they have something to say. And then every time they say something on the platform, we'll just put it in your feed. And the second thing they they promised was we will never ever spy on you. Right? Not like that service run by the evil crackerland Australian Billionaire space, we are the privacy forward alternative where you can come and have a a noncommodified social relation with your friends. Now with social media, lock ins actually quite easy. It comes built in with social media social media dynamics. Because once the people you like"

You have this network effects driven growth where people join because they value the people are already there, and then they make the service more value because people value them. But the the corollary of this network effects driven growth is is that it's very hard to leave. that there's this high collective action problem associated with going You know, those of you who are there in person today in San Francisco, when, like, each of you try to decide where to go for drinks tonight, you're gonna have to argue about it for 45 minutes. if that were, you know, a 180 of you, and a social graph on Facebook, all trying to agree whether it is time to leave Facebook in so where you should go. you're basically hopelessly mired in this collective action problem. So Facebook's customers lock themselves into the the network, and they stay there because of the high switching costs of going. It's not that they like Facebook, but they like the people who are on Facebook. They they they value their communities. They value their family. They value their friends. They value their customers, you know, axiomaticly. That's that's what they're there for. So at this critical juncture, Facebook starts to draw down the surpluses that it allocated to those users in the form of what we could call a clean feed. and a privacy respecting environment and started to reallocate those to business users. So it it turned to the advertisers, and it said, hey. Do you remember when we promise our users that we were never ever gonna spy on them, not like that evil Australian billionaire, it turned out we were lying. and we're gonna spy on them from dusk till dawn. and we are going to build fine grained targeting tools gonna task a lot of engine an engineering resource to make sure that there is an ad fraud or adabuse. When you pay for an ad, someone's gonna see it. And we're not gonna charge you very much for it. We're gonna offer very competitive rates. And to publishers, they said, hey.

You won't even have to rely on our recommendation system they're they're gonna choose to follow you. Now digital tools have got this incredible flexibility that is lacking in the traditional analog markets. digital tools allow for rapid repricing, rapid changes to business logic and so on. And so it was possible for Facebook's management, to subtly alter the conditions to make these firms more relying on Facebook and also to extract value from them one little dribb and drab at a time, So, for example, it could reduce somewhat the policing of ad fraud or raise the prices a little or be less careful about targeting with the publishers, it started to acquire larger and larger excerpts from their posts before they would be shown not just as a recommendation, but even to the people who'd asked to see them to see them. and that culminated with a regime in which your posts are very unlikely to to be shown to anyone unless you remove all links from them on the grounds that they might be malicious links, and also include the full text of the article, which means that you are now just a content provider for Facebook. and Facebook is no longer a funnel driving traffic to your site. All the value has been extracted. but your readers are there, and so you have to be there. And then you got to the final stage. where they're really drawing down all the value to the bare minimum. and they're saying things to They're saying things to publishers like, well, even the people who subscribed to you aren't gonna see the post, even if it's the whole text of the post, even if you haven't linked back to your site, you're gonna have to pay to boost your post."

And this was a bid rigging system to charge advertisers more and and pay publishers less and scoop higher commissions for them. And for the publishers, you also got other scams and and and forms of fraud like the pivot to video where Facebook falsely claimed that it was getting an enormous amount of use for videos on the platform in a bid to get publishers to finance an attempt to compete with YouTube. And so the publishers went out to the capital markets, raise a lot of money, either as debt or as equity, spent billions laid off their print newsrooms, all chasing illusory users who indeed never materialized. and it was a mass extinction event for media. So let's talk about this late stage of and shitification. This is the stage where firms reap all the value except for the bare minimum that retains business customers and end and one of the problems of the late stage and shitification is it quickly gives way to end stage and shitification. That's where end users and business customers both for the exits because the cost of using the platform outweigh the benefits. And the reason that late stage and end stage are so close together. is because the distinction between almost, but not quite useless and useless is is very fine. and the equilibrium that sits at almost but not quite useless is very brittle and difficult to maintain.

So these very large durable platforms that are now going through this mass extinction event. Now teetering on the brink of collapse. They're anomalous in tech. Tech has always had the potential for explosive growth fueled by network effects. We've we've had firms pop up overnight and grow to unimaginable size. But firms in tech have also always been subject to implosive fraction because of low switching costs. We don't know how to make a computer that runs all the programs except for the ones that are disfavored by a company shareholders. And that's why switching costs are intrinsically low intact. The only computer we know how to make is the Turing Complete Universal Von Neumann machine that runs every program we know how to write, and that means that it's always possible to turn a network effect on its head. there's a dominant mainframe company that's making a lot of margin on its peripherals, Someone else can show up and make interoperable peripherals and eat their lunch. If there's a dominant printer company that's charging high margins for ink, someone can show up and make an interoperable ink cartridge and eat their lunch. If there's a dominant operating system that is making an enormous profit on office suite, someone can show up and make an interoperable office suite. If there's a dominant social media platform like MySpace, you can do what Facebook did. which is allow users to depart by giving them a bot that you give your login credentials to that periodically visits MySpace in personates you, scrapes the messages that are waiting for you on MySpace, puts them in your Facebook inbox, Let's see where to reply to them there, and then autopilot's them back out to your MySpace outbox."

That is the historic rallying cry of new technology entrants. a new company can disrupt a highly profitable incumbent by selectively attacking just the profitable parts of its business. The more value the more money an incumbent makes on ads, the more valuable an ad blocker is, and the more you can sell it for. network effects driven growth and low switching cost driven contraction is why tech has historically been so dynamic.

We live in what Tom Eastman calls the Internet of 5 Giant Websites each fill with screenshots of text from the other 4. it's important to have figure out how we got here. It starts with the drawdown on merger policing. Until about 40 years ago, mergers were considered highly suspect especially among firms in the same sector, both horizontal and vertical mergers. But about 40 years ago, with the rise of Reagan anti trust, a a policy that has been amplified by every administration since up to the current one. which has reversed this this 40 year decline, we have welcomed mergers as in as axiomatically efficient as producing firms that are going to do better for their users, and we've treated monopoly as evidence that a company is doing something right rather than doing something wrong.

It's not Willy Wonka's idea factory It's Uncle Penny Bags. just buying up everybody who has a good idea. So As firms accumulate market power, they're able to convert that market power political power. an industry is dominated by a small number of firms, it is able to reliably secure regulation that's favored to it. First, that's because when you have a small number of firms, they don't have to compete as much as they they used to. Think of Google and Facebook dividing up the ad market Jedi Blue, the way the pope divided up the new world for Spain and Portugal. And so you just don't have what what Peter TL calls wasteful competition. Peter Teal says competition is for losers. So and now that they've got all this dry powder, they can decide how to mobilize it overcome the collective action problem of of deciding how to spend that money. there's a small number of firms in a sector, they can all get together and agree on what their priorities should be. And to understand how this plays out, think back to the naps Napster wars, In the in the late 19 nineties early 2000, the tech industry was so much larger in aggregate than the entertainment industry. but the majority of tech firms then were fiercely competitive SMEs. and their competition drove down their margins, depriving them the excess rents that they would spend on lobbying. And they also faced a powerful collective action cost because they squabbled one with one another about how to respond to the shifts in regulation, legislation, and litigation Meanwhile, the entertainment companies"

It's it's what Jay Freeman from the Saudi project calls felony contempt a business model. IP is where we get lock in, and the monotonous growth of IP has allowed the firms who secured a potentially a potentially temporary advantage the 1st decade or so of the 2000 to convert that into what seems like a permanent advantage. IP is why you can't re reverse engineer the Facebook app and allow users to defect to community run forms and still continue to exchange messages with the people who stay behind. It's why ad blocking on the web is the most successful consumer boycott in its history but ad blocking for an app is a felony punishable by a 5 year prison sentence under section 121 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

John John Rockefeller couldn't lay a railroad put in a new oil pipeline with a with a mouse click mouse with a mouse click, but Jeff Bezos can change the business logic of Amazon by just swiddling a knob. And in any shell game, the quickness at the hand deceives the eye. If we focus on the material factors that allow firms to prolong their senescence, the deceptive and unfair practices that lure in users and fuel the rapid network effects driven growth and the wielding of legal to block interoperability and artificially increasing switching costs allowing for lock in then we get rid of the self serving mystique of the tech genius. We can keep users safe and controlled burns that clean out the rotten giants that have crowded at the sunlight and oxygen, that would allow new growth. So to close, we need to keep up with our antitrust remedies. best time to have prevented monopoly formation was 40 years ago, and the second best time is now. We should be cheering on the FTC as they challenge rotten mergers like Activision Microsoft, And as they seek to unwind historic measures to undertaken on false pretenses like Facebook and grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand Grand We should be seeking to limit a platform twiddling passing and enforcing muscular labor and consumer protection rules. ending worker misclassification that allows the abuse of platform gig workers and enacting long overdue American Federal Privacy Law with private rights of action. And finally, we need to reinvigorate user side twiddling by reforming IP law enforcing laws like Europe's DMA and making interoperability in iron an element of all public procurement."

Is it the actions of big is the problem, or is big its own problem? is it the sheer size and the absolute dominance that really causes these phenomenal distortions What's your view on that? So I think that the size is doesn't necessarily cause distortions, although size is prone to a lot of distortions. You know, you think about the coordination problems within large firms.

It can only grow by extracting surpluses from people who search and people whose things are searched for. And within the firm, you have a lot of different product managers whose KPIs and whose bonuses, which are quite substantial, depend on finding ways to increase the profitability of their corner of the firm And so they're all sitting there going, well, I can't grow by making by attracting new search users. I can only grow by whittling away at the value that the two sides of the search market get. And so I'm gonna pull out this Jenga block. But, of course, nobody is coordinating a jenga block removal strategy. Right? So you have adjacent jenga blocks being removed. important things fall over. So, like, last week, Every major airline in America's phone number on Google was replaced with phone number for a boiler room full of scam artists who would take your credit card number and steal from you. Right? And I don't know exactly how that happened, but, presumably, it was something like someone said, well, we have cost center, associated with validating phone number changes. we can realize some efficiency in that cost center either by drawing down human oversight or drawing down the amount of oversight that human does or by having self serve platforms, something that made it cheaper. Right? And they made the firm more profitable, but at this enormous expense. And, you know, ultimately, like, the end stage of and shitfication is the pile of shit. Right? So the end stage of this is that people defect. Right? And and and there is like, you're seeing this with Twitter.

Right? if the referee is less powerful than the team, then the team can cheat. And so if you want a small government, you need firms that are smaller than that government. And the second thing is that even if we stipulate that these companies are well run by people who are very smart, they will still make errors because nobody's perfect. And when you have that much scale gathered into one set of fallible hands, those mistakes were down much further. Right? Mark Zuckerberg's judgment errors are much more consequential than mine. I don't think they're necessarily worse. I mean, you can talk to my wife. She will tell you about my judgment errors. There are there are many and significant. But the worst thing that happens is I make my wife and daughter angry at me, I don't ruin 4 billion people's digital lives. And so I I think that that that's the other dangerous scale.

Let their potential investors see what happens, let hackers who are thinking about doing start up, find out what happens so that they don't even try. Right? So my theory is that if on the one hand, we have some mandates, there's different ways that we're gonna get them. In Europe, the digital markets act is already mandating interoperability, in order to allow competitive new services to enter the market and users to leave with low switching costs. We're gonna have some mandates. We'll also probably get some mandates because there are all these consent decrees against the large firms and going back to the curse of bigness that, like, companies find it very hard to color within the lines. The kind of micro incentives are always to sheet or to push against them. And so whatever, like, settlement they last came to where they pink were they weren't gonna do the bad thing anymore. they're they're breaking it right now. And so this opens the opportunity for new settlements and those new settlements can come with interoperability requirements. And then we can also, like, get interoperability requirements through things like government procurement. Right? So, like, Lincoln refused to buy rifles unless they had standard tooling and ammo for, like, the extremely obvious good reason that you can't say, like, Suri Boys, wars canceled today, our sole supplier decided not to make bullets this week. Right? So we could just say that like matter of public policy, if you supply goods to a public agency, state federal local, you have to covenant not to block interoperability among third parties. or stand up an API or both. And then when you have both of these things, right, when you have the mandate, and you have permission for inter operators to do the things that Apple did when they made IWork suite that the 7 dwarves did when they were making drives in keyboards for IBM 3 sixties that Google did when it showed up and told websites in 1998 that it's user agent was a browser and got copies of all the websites.

We'll just switch disscraping now you've just gotta commit like an unknown number of engineers to to fighting this scrapers. Right? And and so they'll just say, okay. Let's just, like, make the API work because while we would prefer not to have a competitive API, we would prefer even more not to have an unquantifiable risk. And so if we just, like, know what the rules of the road are, we know how the API works. We can observe it. We can know how our competitors are using it. We can plan for it. We can observe in it, then that's what we're gonna focus on. Now as to what, technologists, individual technologists can do You know, I I like to quote my arch nemesis here. Milton Friedman, the architect of the Chicago School of Economics. you know, in in the the years when he was in the wilderness, and people were saying, like, Milton, you have all these ideas for destroying everything people love about the post war consensus where people have, like, healthcare and educate and pensions and so on.

While the pace at which to digital or virtual and non digital worlds are converging is arguably increased list. even a ecosystem has undergone tremendous evolution, and it it has not only changed significantly. but it also continues to be so. So let's briefly take a look at some of these changes note. that due to the time constraints of this presentation, of course, Bill and I won't be able to provide a comprehensive or detailed overview today, but we will concentrate on highlighting some major issues that we believe warrant tension, aiming to stimulate and inform further discussion. So in doing so, we lean on the body of work. We conducted unrelated topics. over the years. To start with, we observe an ever evolving variety of empty patients and services that differ greatly in their demands for network performance and capacities, cloud based computation, security, and so on. arguably responding to the need for more extensive capabilities, to efficiently support ever more demanding applications in the wider range of requirement profiles, if you will, the way the Internet is interconnected where servers are placed, data is stored and processed and how and from where content application services distributed and delivered have experienced a seismic shift. In fact, interconnection points, network computing resources servers. and thus content applications and computing capabilities have been moved closer to end users and devices. For example, a large share of today's Internet traffic is delivered via highly distributed serving infrastructures. make use of of net servers deployed within the networks of ISPs. Now this shift to the edge points to a localization of network traffic, and of network computing resources. On top of that,"

No. In today's ecosystem, service provision is based on a complex and evolving amalgam of interconnected and complementary network computing communications network resources. So, basically, cables, routers, switches, service and many of those are owned and managed or controlled by different entities, which are often competing and have different goals. Some are open and publicly shared, while others are dedicated or managed in the proprietary fashion. In recent years, let's say the focus of academic research and policy debates on the Internet has somewhat shifted towards some if you will, new kids on the block, like a group of non ISP actors such as large content and application providers, sometimes referred to us. Hypergiant and including large digital platform providers. broadly speaking, many of these entities have invested in their own global proprietary managed networks, comprehensive servers, routers, and cables. physical or virtual that they utilize service delivery. recent years, many of these providers have expanded the network footprints and often it's server presence with nice pinetters. Well, this implies that they embrace a more distributed decentralized infrastructures and architectures, the management and control of the respective resources remains centrally with the respective providers. When we shift our focus though to what is sometimes called 5gplus next generation networks. And the need for anticipated role of local or edge clouds things look a bit different. Right? And other actors are likely involved in managing and orchestrating relevant resources. So it's complicated. And both Bill and I have worked in these issues for several years. we will continue to do so. Now But what what's the consequence of this? So what we can say is that"

Again, the time constraints we are facing, I will keep this brief in high level and non exhaustive. First, When we talk about the essential digital infrastructure required for a digital economy future, is about more than just connectivity in broadband. More specifically, broadband and ISP access is not all that is needed for a digital future. indeed, substantial complementary investments necessary. of upstream and downstream. Take, for instance, cloud computing, which is becoming increasingly critical.

Answering that question is a hell of a lot more and answering the question about net neutrality. We wasted 10 years back and away from the stupid argument that all PAC should be treated the stain. Anybody that's involved in network research said all package should not be treated the same. That's what network management's all about. It's designed to sort of figure out if it's a malware packet or a DDoS packet, get rid of it. If it's good traffic, treat it well. When you get to something like 5 g, it's a much, much more complicated problem. Universal service. We're now gonna spend $40,000,000,000 in the United States putting fiber to every broadband serviceable location in the United States. Why we're gonna do that? I don't know.

And that's gonna take a lot of help from academics technologists that really understand how the systems work at social scientists and economists. to understand how these things are thinking about how these things actually impact the real world. And then finally, the ability to frame x anti rules that'll determine how the art networks operate. That may have always been a suspect goal It's completely impossible today. The state space that we're going into in a global Internet where the everything's digital. It's just way too large. We're gonna have to figure out build mechanisms that are capable of detecting when harms are happening and developing more reactive market based ways to respond to that. And looking at the platforms, we could sit there and pick out individual platform and say that's a bad actor. Blow up Facebook. Blow up Amazon. blow up Microsoft, blow up Apple, blow up Cisco, blow up Huawei. Where do we start? What are the companies? What's the ecosystem? Each of those guys runs an ecosystem of platforms. And if you go after Google, and do something because of its search dominance or something like that, you have to ask what does that do for Amazon? And figuring that out is not easy. it's not that, you know, you you shouldn't care, but a lot there's a lot there's a lot of thinking that needs to happen there. And the right way to do that"

We gotta bring all that forward. because the tech the the economist A lot of the economists and policymakers of space think of the Internet in terms of the way it used to be. they think of an Internet that was governed by traditional, not, you know, unpaid peering and transit and that the transit funds and revenues or what's under the revenue. That's not the Internet today, and maybe we can't even go back there. if we could go back that we might not want to, But we have to figure out what to do today's Internet, which is a really different animal And what we want to be public and shared in the public utility and how we wanna have access and access to what and who should contribute to it. These are all questions that there are no simple answers to. So let me wrap there. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for kind of bills. for coming to us and for sharing your work with us. We have time for two questions. So I see AJ in the queue. Is that correct? Maybe. It's Wednesday. Then let's move on with Tobias. So good morning, everyone.

    "text": "You mentioned that you're expecting significant investment from the private sector infrastructure picture. I recently claimed that infrastructure operation in a careful and maintainable manner. is incompatible with the concept of profit. So I'm wondering how do you expect the private sector to profit from the infrastructure that is needed to sustain our society given that it might be hard to actually get a profit from that infrastructure. And what I Yeah. I I the telecoms network was built as as as a public, as a national utility in most countries, and In the US, we built it with AT And T, which is a private monopoly And, you know, we argue about whether that was a good model or not, but it's how we did it. Almost everybody kind of agreed we need to move against away that. And had we not moved away from that? We never would have ended up with the Internet the way we have today. And the original investment in the Internet was a small amount of investment at the edges that took advantage of the public utility aspects of the inner affiliate. Now we're in this place where we may say that significant portions of the investment ought to be public utilities. and That's a debate, and there are some people smart people to actually believe that. And I wouldn't dismiss that point of view But I would say that if you thought about trying to actually move some of that direction, You're gonna need a really good argument for how you get there. You're gonna face some very, very resistance from basically Everybody. That that that's investing in this space. And the fact of the matter is if you actually look at the empirical numbers, most of the money that they're talking about, if you look at the the the investment by private actors, it absolutely dwarfs the public investment that's available here. So either we say, There's a whole lot of money that's gotta come from the public sector general tax revenues, that are put towards this public utility and then it's regulated, or have to figure out how to manage private actors. And if we're managing private actors,"

Okay, Colin. Hi. Colin Perkins. Interesting talk. Thank you very much. one of the I forget quite how you phrased it. You you said the policy was driven by economic failure from 20 years ago. To what extent do you see the problems with seeing as being due to the the mismatch in speed of innovation in in Red regulatory environment versus the technical environment. I see that as a really key factor, and I think it's this the fact that, basically, the technologies have got good enough that I think regulation at a national sovereign level is really, really hard. and I think that the key instrument will be architecture and standardization because I don't think any of the international bodies right now, if you just ask yourself, Maybe in the old days, Cisco designed a router that was the Internet and We might not have loved it, but it we we kinda knew whatever we thought of Cisco. then, you know, the FCC, except to say, we don't know I can, and we could just tell other people the rest of the world do, and and that world no longer exists. And that's a good thing But who would we stand up? The ITU, or a completely new formulated ICANN or the World Bank, or or Amazon or any of these other guys. None of those people are great candidates. The best hope, I think, is in standards and intelligent architectures that allow options. And one of the problems about getting standards if someone came out with a good technology is how do you get people to adopt it and deploy it? That's a big economic challenge and a tough one.

Hello, Derek. Should I start if that's okay? Yes, please. Go ahead. You do you have a keypad to advance the slides, or should do it. Please, yes, if you could do that for me. Okay. Can you click once? please. Please. So a month ago, it was I was at the decentralized web camp, camp number 2 hours north from San Francisco. Tim Burns Lee was there, but also a long a lot of young people, the DWAP movement, so to speak. and they kind of liked the atmosphere, things are crumbling or burning And we have alternatives But at the same time, you realize they play the same game as the others. they all run around and say, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. And we are the better ones. come to us. And if if people are really doing that. How do the other people"

And if you do the move to go another platform, you have to leave traces, you have to inform others how you can be reached, how you keep the family together, how important things are kept. So even if things are burning, there are some things you have to preserve and the networking. Next slide, please. We know that this is the rendezvous problem as the initial problem of even before you establish communication, you know how to know where to come in. how to communicate. It is that's classic example of two people meeting in a large park. If both decide to not move around and find each other that we never never find each other. If both move around, chances are very slim. Maybe it's better that one party stays, the other searches. but how do you coordinate that? You have communication. So there's really an intrinsic heart problem there. In networking, we have that the same. We use standards, and everybody doesn't have think about how to do things, And we have to address that in that now burning Okay. environments that we have Next slide, please. So here is a suggestion to fill that small gap that I think is there, and we have to address that. we shouldn't think about having a kind of a common element where everybody can look up where everybody else is, we would just build a new platform we also shouldn't overload existing platforms like DNS, to have a record where everybody can be located These are single point of failures. And in many cases, we know GNS is not working where when it should and when it's most urgently needed. So the story that I got out from all the talking with decentralized web people is we have to disintermediate, and it is possible for a small amount of information And this is what my talk is about, how to solve the rendezvous problem without blood forms, Next slide, please."

    "text": "So that is the way I would phrase it. Think about generic write that each human entity is allowed to send 200 bytes a month That is the novelty that you are allowed to ingest and to use any means to convey that information. I don't talk about protocols or infrastructures to make that happen. But just entitlement. And once you have it, you will find ways. Others will come and provide ways to do that, And why I brought here my antenna here this is a shortwave antenna. Typically, shortwave, it has wavelength from 20 to 80 meters. This is shortwave antenna for 10 meters. with with a laundry clip, I move it to 20 meters bandwidth With that antenna in such a transceiver, five watts you reach Japan, and back, So that is what you can do end to end without intermediaries. So this is not science fiction. We have technical solutions to let People speak, at long distances, And there are ways we should imagine to push that forward. The we they're also kind of the so called pocket switch networking where people run around with USB sticks. All this is okay. If there is awareness that people should be allowed to do that. If they have found a way, they should not be stopped by poll or somebody else to do that. So let's next slide, please. So how would they did I came up with that number? And it might be not an exact number, you could use that exactly for spreading your new social media hand where you are but we can also have cryptographic usage of that if you want to say, oh, I had a compromise on one of the key use, the other one. you can also have a redirection how we call it in computer science saying, I'm out town, please contact this person. But also for emerge situation, we need kind of something that doesn't depend on turning off the SkyNet or whatever."

    "text": "And the other reason how why to go low is not because we it would be nice to have more, but 200 bytes a month, you can't do much harm. This is something that is still managed Next slide, please. almost at the end. So what is the overall volume, it's quite small. If you collect everything, if you do the adjusted the multiplication, everything fits on 1 of these small USB sticks then it's also something that is not really novel. others do that already for trust reasons because you can't have a trusted central entity see all service certificates are collected and brought and globally rebroadcasted and kept in multiple repositories that everybody can check that everybody is doing same thing, and you need broadcast to do that. And this the the industry paying for that. And, finally, so if about the feasibility, you could Also, if that is a common right to do, why not also ask the platforms to provide you this. So Apple provides you emergency channels Why not to 200 bytes a month? It's really not a big load. On top of that, what they want to offer you. Next slide, and that's the final one, I think. So that is a decor. So burning everything down is fine, but there are things which have to stay. So we can keep contact to solve the rendezvous problem and make it really more easier to do that switching I don't think about creating the new platform but expressing the need and the right to use such a channel And and if you were use a lighthouse thing, don't build the giant tick lighthouse that collects all that information, just enable, allow each individual persons, if they want to do so to operate their own channel, that is what I think is a core thing for decentralizing with that, we will always be at the mercy of others solving the random problem for us. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Christian. So I would have a couple of questions, but I see we have Eric in the queue. So Eric, you do have the floor thrust,"

    "text": "Hey, Eric Oswald. George Mason University. As Very interesting. I I like the idea, but I had a question. So sort of feels a little bit like the forest tree falling in the woods, and no one's there to hear So do you need a platform to capture the broadcast in case the recipient you want to hear it wasn't listening. you send it. Yes. But, I mean, the platform you could try to have several platforms offering that. You would not build 1 to do it. I I agree the story in forward or what, as mentioned, the asynchronous communication offered by Facebook and the others is one of the value that helps in the rendezvous. We would have to do that. But who knows? Maybe this device is just They just listen a month long, and they filter on what you are interested in. also, technically, we could even go around the store and forward necessity. But would have to explore that. So one question I had is, what is the trust infrastructure that you need for that? How how can you trust these messages? That is typically observation trust is created out of band, and then you use it in the system in the asked you for a service certificate. This is really nineties. you had to physically show up at the certificate issuer and improve that you are representative of that university to get a certificate for that Now we have a, let's encrypt where it's just proving that you have the DNS name. So it's out of bounds in principle, and the decentralized people do that they have signing parties. You know you with whom you talk. And from that on later on, you can reconnect later If it's out of the blue and we're talking to someone you have never met, then you have a problem. but that is not addressing this one. It's we have already some trust anchors, and you want to right continue using that you simply lost the person out of sight you want to reconnect later. Okay. Thanks."

You mentioned that institutions can issue your certificate you see a way you can issue me a certificate with my name. And, therefore, you don't need the and M Space. Correct? If not, the thing is, and what would be by the namespace. Well, the namespace I'm using right now is from execution Scatterbuck. It's a e d 25519 key randomly generated And I have other people's when I have a signing party. No. That this is me. I can transfer that information. I can have trusted friends, which collect maybe that information, we can do that grassroots up, if we know each other. If it's a different story, if we talk about banking relationship, things like that. there there must be probably some trust industry thing vouching for this is really the e d2559 from this bank or not. But here, I was more looking at user perspective, and I think this is a proposal exactly for these guys. given we are out of time. So I would let's talk later. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I thought we were out of time. I meant it's been gearing. I was Sorry if you explained this, but do you can you elaborate on how you proposed to enforce this, like, 200 byte quota, quota, Like, what what would prevent me from doing a 200 and first bite within a month using your posal proposal Like, how do you enforce the quota on the end of them?

And even if it's worldwide, a 100,000 people have used that, the rest of the vast majority would simply use the tool as it was built was meant to be used. So I'm not afraid of that really. Okay. They are actually quite some interesting questions in the chat. Let me just pick 1, maybe, to wrap this up. So let me just echo Dave who was asking, Kristen, so why do you think the web of trust approaches haven't been successful in the past. You do a lot of of of data keeping cleaning up, keeping up to date your contact lists. This is some really convenient that you get by the centralized platforms that keep keep that for you and So you see a lot of of manual stuff that you have to do, I I stopped doing the signing part now accept I came back to to these decentralized things, but it's much more difficult to easily grow Now I just exchanged phone numbers. We I mean, these contacts still exist. It's it's a way to bootstrap trust. So I I wouldn't single it out. it has become much easier than in the past."
