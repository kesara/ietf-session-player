    "text": "I'm probably missing something but if the URL determines the version doesn't that imply that you do need to have the intermediary server so that you have the URL yeah that's a good question I think we'll need to think on that a bit um yeah especially if we want to have it be available to expand into like device to device communication or something like that um maybe consider putting it into the credential format in some way definitely hi this is Nick I just want to comment on that as well um you know proprietary solution does not need to use URLs at all if it doesn't um want to go through the intermediary server so that'll be just left up to just you know the proprietary solution and its own versioning if it wants to negotiate that so you could do it over you know like nearby sharing or you know uh whatever Bluetooth or uwb or whatever it is that you want to do foreign any other questions from anyone we are yeah all right I think then uh we'll close it off and thank you everyone for coming we have some action items uh that we'll take from here and we'll continue the discussion on the meaning list have a great idea week thank you thank you"
