    "text": "so websites typically use cdns uh to deliver their content efficiently to the end users and they have this cluster of servers spread across across the globe uh typically called cd in edge and at the edge we have protocols like tcp and http that dictate the data transmission rules so there's multiple options available we have multiple types of http and different http configuration and similarly for tcp we have different congestion controls like bbr cubic reno and multiple other options such as congestion windows and it's the job of operator to select the configuration that are expected to maximize the performance traditionally the operator selects one set of configuration which are then homogeneously used for the entire user base and in this work we we asked this question that is this approach really optimal so can you go to the next step please so in fact when we look at the client here or the user base we see that there's a diversity there uh users come from different regions have different last-minute connections like 2d 3g 4g and it's a problem because the performance of the protocols is sensitive to the type of network and devices so assuming that us an edge has three users uh one with low latency one with high bandwidth and one with high loss network parts the choice of optimal configuration can be very different based on the type of network and in fact we did some measurements at scale that actually showed that there's a tremendous opportunity here there's an opportunity to improve web performance and the figure here shows the improvement in ph low time for websites and there's up to 70 improvement at tl if we are using uh some sort of an article to uh configure the right configuration on the per connection basis so next please so in this work uh we propose a system"

    "text": "that optimizes web performance by systematically reconfiguring the networking stack so basically taking into features such as users network uh the device and website our system selects uh predicts the right set of configuration that should be expected to maximize the performance next slide please so we proposed uh two changes to the existing uh cdn architecture we first proposed a data path component that runs at a server level and it it is basically a modification of the today's networking stack and it allows a flexible reconfiguration so that we can tune things like tcp condition control or http on a per connection basis and the second component is a global control path uh that uses some algorithmic and some machine learning magic to try to predict the right set of configuration that that can be used so basically this this runs in a data driven sort of model and it ingests data uh from the servers and uh models the performance of different configurations uh next site please uh so in this work uh we asked this question that uh since it's hard to make or design protocols that are generalizable across different types of networks and devices perhaps this is the right time where we should invest and design systems that can make that our networking stack architecture more flexible so that our networking stack can dynamically adapt to what the users have on their end so if you are interested in learning more about it please reach out to me or my advisor theo benson or you can take a look at our nsdi paper uh i'll be also in philadelphia from tomorrow and uh if you want to talk more about it we can definitely do that thanks thank you [Applause]"
