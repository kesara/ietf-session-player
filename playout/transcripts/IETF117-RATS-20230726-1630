So at the at first, I would like to say that initially we didn't had a very clear introduction text of why we need this standard. and what is the relevance of Chorim. So we have extensively added very clear text in the introduction sections highlighting the need for Coreim Standard where where where I would just summarize quickly in a minute or so. There are multiple supply chain actors are publishing endorsements at different points in time in different formats. There are different vendors. and each vendor has different product lines. So the verifier has to kind of see these whole things in a coherent fashion. So this needs a standard And this is why we have the Corim Standard now. and That is why we we thought of adding a lot of clear text in the introduction and and the Korim commit and cost with description text have been added in a great detail there. So In in addition to that, We have added appraisal workflow, maybe a better term would be verification flow, high level verification, workflow of how a coding based endorsement can be used to follow the verification. And in certain cases, it becomes even more relevant when the evidence coming from the tester is also following the scoring format. So And in addition to that, we explained the in more clarity, the need for current profiling, why we need profiling, in general, in scoring and how one would use it and what are the constraints and what are the limitations and what care one should use one should take when take using the current profiles. and then there are the CBAR text stuff.

It needs to The document reader should have a good understanding of that aspect Right. when evidence and endorsement, both are encoding feedback even works better. and that helps build a standard high level flow and kind of gives a guidance for verifier implementers get a standard based verifier like what we are building as where I open source project horizon, how it would function, and Our ultimate goal is to have a 1 standard based unified verification process and flow so that we don't have fragmented verification flows and fragmented verifications for different types of attestation technologies. That's the end goal. So we added with this intention in mind, we added the evidence appraisal procedure. into the document. Yeah. So Next slide, please. So, broadly, the evidence appraisal flow or the logical or algorithm can be broken down into three steps. 1 is the appraisal context initialization. then the evidence collection and then evidence appraisal, we will go a bit into detail about these three step"

So as I as I mentioned, earlier in the previous slides that there are multiple supply chain actors. So when a device life cycle or device goes the life cycle events. There could be multiple authoritative entities publishing quarims for a particular vendor and particular model. So potentially, in a verifier, you could and this you could see multiple corims in the database. And So when the verifier needs to do the appraisal, then it needs to collect all the relevant corims extract those corims, take out the commits, coswits, and courts the inside the from the Korim, and then based on the Cobom which which tells so one which needs to be activated, it needs to extract the relevant information from these commits and cost suites. even before that, it needs to verify the signature because corim can be signed So it is coming from a valid author source of authority. If they are not, they just can be rejected. So it needs this phase of appraisal context initialization is essentially collection of the relevant corims and the data inside that especially commit cost within courts, and be ready for the next stage of our verification flow. So Next. Your guess, you've got Hank on the queue. I don't know if you wanna take questions. Yes. Henkip. Maybe he wants to add something in there, and I'm happy to kind of take the questions here as well. Yeah. Hank. Go ahead, please. Yeah. The mic is very far away. Hi. This is Hank. I'm doing this.

So this this step 2 is more about evidence where the there is a communication between the tester and the verifier for the collection of evidence And the first step after the collection of evidence is the verifier, does the cryptographic validation of the evidence token we we pro we don't promote a specific evidence protocol, but multiple evidence collection protocols. can be and should be supported And once the cryptographic verification or the cryptographic authenticity of the evidence has been complete. the verifier would then extract the individual claims and represent it in a format, which is suitable for the matching"

This is another important thing which I I would very much focus on the subject is after done with the basic evidence and appraisal evidence appraisal. What we we are discussing in our weekly meetings is how to model composite attesters because Compositor testers is is is a thing. and you would see in various discussion that it is not just a particular piece of a tester which is generating the evidence, but it is evidence could be a composition or a composite at say, for example, a test station produced by GPU in a device and a CPU in a device and how the composite resistor would look like and how the endorsements associated to the compositor tester would look like. So we have couple of options. We have meeting in the meetings, how the endorsements for the compositor tester would would look like? I don't know. What would be their information and data format? And another important topic we have been discussing in our weekly meetings is modeling the life cycle when when this specific firmware components or whatever is your reference values. They change our time, the firmware gets updated, how would we model that how would we model when certain when a security vulnerability detected in a software component, you want to remove that from or you want to mark that unusable.

It's very important for auditing that you kinda stopped something 10 years ago to update, still using it. I can see what what consequences this is today. has today. And I think that's that's an excellent another use case, and we are thinking a little bit also on that direction that we never really make them go away, but therefore, continuous auditing for a longer span of time after the fact, let them exist. state existing.

We just add 20 lines of CDDL, and now it becomes evidence. So the matching for the verifier is, like, super simple now because it's symmetric format. And that's concise evidence. And there will be a document, and I actually thought that would be there before the submission are cut off, but it wasn't. and it it isn't today. So my optimism was a little bit fathered. there will be a good reference for that, and we would we'll see the 20 lines of CD Telecom Transmog via coram into concise evidence.

So So, yeah, it's an encaps encapsulation for concept for message as defined by the red architecture. So especially for some example here for the background check model, allows a record relying party to a diagnostic about the actual format of the evidence. if that's bundled with it. So exchange between the test and verify becomes easier, around parties, are basically if they're related, they don't care."

Again, I don't wanna repeat it unless you questions because we had we presented that in the 15 minutes or so of last IETF. May So I'm gonna talk about this is what was in draft 0 0 that we presented last time. so I'm gonna talk about the differences. So next slide. So last time, there was a bunch of people that said in the working group, yes, we should have a document on this. And, oh, can you talk about this too? And so Thomas Visadi was one of those. Thank you, Thomas. And so one of the issues that he raised had to do with conditionally endorsed values this and this discussed and some other documents that he pointed me to. And so the idea here is that so talk about endorsements in general. Some claims and investments might be conditional. Like, This particular value applies only if the evidence says that the following thing 2. Right? So if the version of the software is greater than 5, then it means that the security property is x. k? And so and so that concept was not previously in the document, and it's now used in other places, and so it's good to have that text in there. So I offered some text, and Thomas Actit. And so it's now in draft 2. There's also guidance that says you should not be using there's no point in using conditionally endorsed values for things that are immutable like a hardware serial number or anything else is burning your hardware. Right? you'd either endorse it or not endorse it. Right? There's no reason to have a conditional thing and make the verifier spend cycle checking. item And then there was a question I first asked and then answered my question. And Thomas said, yes. I agree with your answer, and I think Ned said the same thing. Anybody else reviewed it so far. Said, yes, I agree with your answer. And the question was, When doing these conditions, then you have some notion of matching. right, says, okay. If this value is greater than this 1 or is equal to that one, so you got this matching against some value. k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k? k?

And he said, well, we better explain What the difference is because it'll become a frequently asked question if we don't. k. k. k. And so here's what we said. There's 2 differences. k? One is that anything that's in the conditionally endorsed values and the indoor is not about trustworthiness, which is a judgment call by the verifier. or a judgment call about the airline party is delegated to the verifier. Right? It's about whether the endorser says the following things are a true if and only if. And so here, the thing that's in control of the reference that a comparison of the expected values. Right? You can see matches some expected values. I needed a term other than reference values, and I get to this later on. because the document in draft 2 confuses them as is pointed out. And by Mohammed in the last slide. And so here, I'm using expected values just to give a terminology distinction. And so here can or endorsers in control of that that says, I'm endorsing it as long as the following values crew. Right? As opposed to the the verifier that says, I'm going to say it's trustworthy if the following things are true. That's a different statement, a different phrasing. even though some of the matching things like, you know, equals or greater than or equals, or so on might be the same or similar. that that that the sort of operators. Right? then there's just a note that says, okay. If this notion of saying, okay. How do I coded greater than operation or greater than or equal to operation or a set membership operation. If that if your endorsements is in a different format coming into the verifier than the appraisal policy, just means, yeah, you gotta have 2 parsers that say greater than equal to means this thing in this format and greater than or equal means this thing that's how it just encoded. a statement about encoding of verifiers. error implementations of verifiers. Okay. So that's basically what the text says. And so far, the filers have been happy with that, but it's different from last time, and we didn't talk about it."

    "text": "other than Thomas raising it at the mic. So Yep. at. Next slide. So that was the first of the three issues. Second one. Also are also originally raised by Thomas Visadi, but as we'll see also raised by Mohammed. the notion that there exists some claims that have to do with identity. Right? And so if you looked at the core M document that was that your guesser is resenting, right, where it talked about the different steps and so on. Right? It's very common in verifier implementations to say I'm gonna do 2 passes. Right? My first paragraph steps, I should say. The first step is to cryptographically check to see whether the evidence comes from something I should bother spending CPU on k? And if that passes, then sure I'll take the accepted claims and run the appraisal policy and compare them against reference values and so if you break it into those two steps, means some things that come into the evidence That would be or, you know, some things that come in in the endorsement, I should say, are are about yell. identity related claims. For some definition of identity. Right? Many different definitions. The point is things that you'd apply to that first pass step that says, is it worth doing the other stuff? k? so whether it's verification keys or whatever else, it's part of that cryptographic check that says, do I trust the thing enough to see whether it's trust to to see if it's okay in the current state. k. So you don't have to do those 2 passes. But if you do, then it fits with category of identity related claims, since there was at least two people that were asking for it, we had a text in there that says, okay. You could have this. Now syntactically, it might be encoded because this is not a document about encoding. It's up level thing, but syntactically, it can be it could be treated just like any other claim. Or you could treat it maybe separately semantic and say, well, it's the identity batch of stuff. there's the non identity batch of stuff and you do these claims in step 1, these claims in step 2. some implementations might treat them differently, and we know, like, So Verizon does treat them differently in that way."

    "text": "And so the generalization of endorsing identity is just a say appraised the policy for evidence might have multiple steps. k? So identity is the most obvious example if we might have step 1 and step 2, you can imagine more complicated one that just says you could define this of having three steps or some thing, you know, whatever it is. You know, freshness check, you know, you could do your identity check, then a freshness check, and then the rest of the appraisal. Right? whatever it is. Right? And so the endorsements might have, you know, the appraisal policy for evidence might have multiple steps, and so the endorsement, he says to be aware of that. need to provide endorsed information that would be necessary in that step. k. So, again, this whole document is intended to be informational. just like the architecture document was. Right? There's nothing about encoding. There's nothing that's actually you'd implement. It's all about people writing the other documents. be able to refer to this. Right? So my hope is that, for example, Corim, which does talk about encoding for an investment format, could, informatively, reference this document, right, assuming it gets adopted by the working group. Okay. Okay. Next slide. k. So those are the 2 that actually first got filed and and were addressed before draft 2 appeared. The last one is one that I found myself. this is also another topic that was not discussed in the architecture So I wanna take a couple minutes on this one. This is actually the one I'll spend the most time on is this one slide here. k? And I think we have time, but let me know if I need to speed up. k? Yep. Even another 9 minute. Okay. Great. I'm gonna probably spend several of them on this one slide alone. Alright. So on the right side, we have things that go in evidence. And so your evidence can have a number of different claim sets In this example, those claim sets are for different components at different layers. So, for example, think of a dice change. Right? We have a claim set for your hardware, claim set for your firmware, claim set for your maybe OS, a claim set for maybe the application that's actually you're talking to, some set of things in your evidence that's at different layers. And this is an example where they're strictly stacked because that was the example that I used in the other slide, everybody liked."

So I took this part on the right, and it kinda matches to their slide that everybody liked. that that And so in the past, we've normally talked about endorsements as being the bottom left. Right? The endorsement comes from a hardware manufacturer, and it comes to says, well, if the following thing is true, then here's some additional claims and values whether they're conditional or unconditional that apply to my hardware. Right? So, you know, if it's Intel, then Intel would say, ah, this thing is good. because it has a serial number and here's some other properties that apply to that model and so on. Right? Or if it's, you know, NXP with an arm chip, then it'd say, okay. Well, this thing has trust zone. If it says this is this model, then here's some additional properties about trust zone that you can Now the difference is here that each different component here on the right, Could. come from completely different manufacturers or vendors. Right? You could have whoever makes your hardware, Whoever you got the firmware from, whoever you got the firmware from, Let's say you're running, you know, Windows or a particular Linux row, and then an app claim set, and those could all be from different vendors. k? So this concept that says, whoever the manufacturer or vendor is of a particular component, k? Says I have some additional properties about that thing that I'm going to vouch for. And if you trust me, the provider of that piece of software or hardware, then here's some additional properties that could be add ins based on conditions being true. So you might say, as the OS claims that with the OS version number is greater than or equal 5 or say, you know, Linux Kernel, then here's some additional properties that i is the distro would want to vote for about that. Right? I'd say that there are no CVEs or passed this compliance test or whatever. I could put those in there, and so this is showing an example. We can have endorsements about multiple components that come from different sources. k? Exactly. But it's never been discussed any place, and so this is a diagram to point set out. k?

I wanna trust this endorser for this component and not other ones. k? That's a concept that needs to be in the document. It's not in 2 that will be in 3. k?

So I mean, I would expect a section that's like three pages long that says key material for verifying evidence. in this draft. I would expect it, and I would expect it not to be named identity because Some places use the term identity. Some places don't. I mean, that's just at least I don't I mean, to me, that term is ambiguous. It doesn't key material is not synonymous or it doesn't queue me in to to the idea of key material. So let me give you an example of a project an attestation project that I worked on that involved 2 Fortune 500 companies represented in this room that involve creating 1,000,000 of keys, a database of millions of keys and shipping them from 1 from the hardware vendor to the software vendor. That was the way the attestation keys were transferred. These were we're basically seeds that were used to generate EC keys. They were secrets. is No. Actually, they weren't. There was secret on the manufacturer side and and public on the other side. So that's a use case, a very real use case that was built that has to be allowed for in this document.

I don't think the word identity captures that at all. know, so, Add station keys can be public keys. They can be symmetric keys.

So just a quick one. what do you see a need for this draft if if you can If you possibly you can collaborate with us on Corim And make that draft better rather than having a separate draft. There's a distinction Yeah. So let me give you the the analogy that the architecture document itself is informational and allows multiple bindings for different things, like multiple evidence formats and so So, for example, if you were to look at each and say, well, this makes sense to put in the e document. No. The e document is quote standard, and it's particular encoding. And the architecture document is kind of an overview across documents. It says, okay. Here are some documents about evidence. Here are some documents about reference values and endorsements, here's some documents. And so it's an informational place as opposed to a thing that you actually implement. And so that division, the work can represent another work in other documents, And so that's what I see as why not to put it in core M per se as to because CRM would be a proposed standard document, not an informational one. and the the same division we did in other documents, and so that's why it's document right now is because, logically, the document we would have put it in k? k? is if we were doing this, you know, 3 years ago, we would have put it into the architecture document. So think of it as an extension to the architecture document that's decoupled because it's about a a a different related topic. The the chairs agree with you, Dave. k. Alright. Thanks. Okay.

It's either just after just before, but I didn't get to it for filing 02. And so there's one outstanding issue. Besides the one I mentioned, that has yet to be filed that I presented as this security considerations, around the in around the multiple endorsements and stuff. So this one was filed. So Mohammed filed this 1, and it has a bunch of bullet in there that I can split into 3 categories, at least that's how I interpret The first one is technical comments. k? And I put that into categories of wanting to discussion of endorsing identity, and something that I believe is addressed or or should be addressed by any future versions, if it's not right now, of the conditionally endorsed value k? So I'm not gonna talk about the technical ones because I believe that everything can be bucketed into one of the previous slides. Okay? And I'm sure Muhammad will correct me if that's not the case, but right now actually talk through it. My guess is the second one. The way to solve it is conditionally endorsed values just to tell you what he was talking about. It was about the text that says in the architecture document. actual state is in the combination of, like, evidence and endurance months, and he says, well, you know, endorsements actual state make them a different time may come at different times or whatever. So how does that work? and good texture on conditionally endorsed values could say, well, I conditionally endorsing. These are the current values that I'm endorsing if and only if the current values or whatever. Right? So there may be a better discussion of that given that this came in afterwards. But that's why the conditionally endorsed values is really what he's talking about there. Then there's some editorial ones like he pointed out that there is lowercase reference reference values as a typo, and uppercase reference values. Now they're the same, or are they different? Well, the actual answer is uppercase reference values mean what the ARC doc says, Lower case reference values was, in some cases, the same. type o.

And then he had a question some questions to say just they experience, this is right. For SGX, k? how the supply in the s g x example and talked about your MR Enclave and so on. is what is the exact mapping of this? And and well, one answer is any of the answers should be on the list, not in the document. Right? Because this isn't the binding document. This is the high level thing And the goal is just to make sure that there's no statement that is, like, incorrect when you take SGX into account. Right?

So Today, on this session, I'm going to talk about how we have used a test station as a as a first across tradential for authentication in the TLS handshake So this is the title of my presentation. If we can go to the next slide, please. So this style just basically, we have been using t i PKI for traditional authentication on the TLS protocol, And what we are proposing here is to introduce remote attestation, which means verifying the hardware features for and and attesting the security state of the device as part of the deal is handshake. and and we we are standardizing this artestation work as an authentication mechanism in TLS. and to to validate our cons proof of to validate what we are proposing in the standards. We have an open source working proof of concept now. And that that activity is part of the CCC sick. the con confidential consortium sick special interest group. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Next slide, please.

They exchange those capabilities for attestation so as to agree on a certain set of media types and stuff, and then kinda undergo the attestation exchange. so that the attestation can be undertaken as part of the TLS handshake. And the last point I want to highlight it, it is a mutual at a station h which means client client can verify the server as well as the server can verify the client based on the attestation credentials that that protocol supports authenticating both sides. Yeah. Next slide, please. You've got Lawrence on the queue. Oh, okay. Sure. Do you mean attesting both client and server or authenticating both client and server or both. the TLS does the both actually. It doesn't the t authentication, and then this extension does attestation. Yes. So this extension would allow the attestation of both sides, basically. As a client can attest -- Okay. and server can assist you. Yeah. Okay. And so this is in addition, all of this is in addition to the authentication provided by TLS. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So kind of along the same lines, when you say It's bilateral attestation Yeah. Is it a requirement that you have to have bilateral authentication in order to have bilateral attestation. No. It is not a requirement. This is a feature which which lets you do that. It is not we are not saying that you have to do mutual. it's based on what topology and in what scenario you want to use this feature. It depends on that. Hey. Does that answer your question then? Go ahead. Yeah. That answers it. Thanks. Yeah. Bye. Yep. Yep. Okay. So next slide, please. So Maybe we need to click couple of more times. Yes. So, yeah, so this is the kind of the kind of arrangement. We have this arrangement highlights the kind of concept we are trying to establish here is their tester generating the platform, a station, open. and then the same root of trust having a key and that which is signing the workload identity key, the and the workload identity keys, proof of position, and it is in the secure state is the is is established through the key attestation token, and there is a some degree of binding between the platform or the station token and the key at the station token, which is express"

So we know all know that TLS 1.3. This is predominantly for TLS 1.3 and not for TLS 1.2. So the client exchanges a client hello message, and in that we we kind of think our client expresses By the way here, I'm trying to show you a a model where the client is the attester and the server is the relying party. and we are trying to express background check model of flow here. So this is the initial settings seen. on which this flow is based but we can always flip the roles, but that is not the intent here for this particular message sequence. So the client generates an client hello message to start the exchange, and here it it basically, in the evidence proposal extension, it shows it expresses what types of evidence is it support it may support more than 1. So it says xabc, and then potentially verifier queries establishes a new session in the verifier to understand what type of evidence formats, the verified supports, and what evidence formats, the server can subsequently handle and then it expresses that in the server hello message. but precisely through the encrypted extensions,"

And so the server issues a certificate request message, which And and the as subsequent to that, the client establishes the proof of position by generating evidence, which is a combined evidence, which has Nons received from the server. and It generates a combined attestation bundle and it sends that In the certificate message, And then subsequently, it establishes the proof of position of the key by signing the signature sig and then reporting it in the certificate to verify message. and it has As you can see, the evidence is reported in the conceptual message wrapper. which we use, which Henk has already discussed about that. So Russ has a question. I'm happy to answer. Plus. getting there. Hi. Hi, Russ Hausley. I'm a little bit confused what's going on here. Yeah. If the New certificate, format, Yeah. in the TLS sense.

So once the relying party or server receives the evidence. It exchanges the evidence, it sends the conceptual message wrapped evidence, into the verifier, and verify receives an attestation result. In attestation result, it it gets the attestation key it gets the attestation key as an augmented and claim extension claim set because the evidence has the key and it can once the attestation is complete, that is posted in the attestation result extension, and then the the key is then used to verify the signature on the suggested in the certificate verify message. The verify AR is basically, here is the verification of attestation result using the verified public key.

Yeah. certificate extension extension. so so the CA needs to sign over the CMW, which contains the evidence, No. It is just passed.

So now with a chair hat on, it seems that there are relevant use cases, it seems that the draft and discussion isn't clear enough yet and requires some work especially based on this feedback. So my recommendation is to go back, taking this feedback, consult the interested parties, people who have mentioned doing similar work, And I think in that regard, you'll wind up addressing Russ' question earlier by looking at these other use cases designed within other standards bodies, after you get to that phase, my recommendation would be present this within the TLS working group, and I would wait until you are that refined so that it is clear within that group where you might not be hitting attestation expert. So get it further along work with those in this community who are interested, look at the similar works specified And you could float it back on this mailing list to make sure you've if if dotted all your i's and crossed your t's, and then it does need to go to TLS as well. I think just to clarify, we have shared this work item with TLS as well last time. So We haven't ticked much on the draft as of this between last session and this session because we are focusing on proof of concept of what we have so documented so far in the document. So we have not presented this time explicitly with the TLS, but the group Okay. -- they are aware of this. of TLS Group is already been notified, and -- Okay. So what I'm saying is you're gonna get better feedback from them if you sure up, shore up, the document based on the feedback here.

So this slide highlights what what rats drafts we have used in our basically, the draft also covers these references to these rats existing drafts and documents and we have used them extensively in our prototype which is we have used Corim to provision endorsements into the fire, And then we have used conceptual message wrapper to wrap the evidence so that the rep the the evidence just blindly translates seamlessly translates without any modification. in any of the wrapped protocol between a tester and the relying party. And then we have used e r heat based attestation results to be translated received from between verifier and the LAN party. So This is just a highlight of usage of rats documents. Yeah. Next slide, please. Sorry, Dave. You have a question here. I was just gonna ask if you could say something about the rightmost vertical line sensation of labels on that one. Yeah.

So this shows the highlight of the prototyping architecture. where the attester or the client also has a MBTLS stack, and The server is the one which receives the evidence or in the other way around in the model, it could be registration results also. and then the evidence is exchanged with the verifier which here is shown as version. which does the attestation evidence appraisal. and then returns the station results. which are then used to it. establish the trustworthiness of and the use of the key to So that's the high level flow.
