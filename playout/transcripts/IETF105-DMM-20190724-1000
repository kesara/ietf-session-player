    "text": "the Associated UPF for efficiency reasons if we do that we deviate from the plain routing rules if we want to maintain the u.s. IP address so in that case we apply the concept that we described in the graph which is basically having policy enforcement point on the two ends of the n6 interface and control them in a way that we have unambitious traffic routing between the old or the new anchor and the associated services so the scope of this draft first of all describes the use case in the operational aspects second we propose how such data plane overlay on the n6 interface can be integrated and aligned with policies in the 5g control plane because the UPF is under control of the cellular control plane and then six we want to have additional controllers to enforce the the routing policies here so in this draft we want to look mainly at some architectural and operational aspects and then define the data models that are required on this interface between the controller and the data plane note second between the controller and the 5g control plane as you can see you will leverage a standard 3gpp function which is the application function as a binding element between the 5g control plane and the n6 state opening so one of the key concepts is that we consider two types of deployments here so I said we need policy enforcement points for traffic steering on the two ends of the n6 interface so one is always aligned with the data network so we have here which can receive and enforce policies for traffic treatment on the other sent side we have two options so the UPF may receive the upstream traffic treatment policies directly from the mobile core we are the n4 interface that\u0027s what we call tight coupling currently we\u0027ll look more at the loose coupling options for M EC which you can see later why we do that and here basically we keep the n6 traffic treatment policies and the associated control independent of the mobile core which has some advantages so the status of this work is that we started to discuss concepts with some of you before ITF 103 and before we continued with that on ITF 104 and we received interest in valuable feedback which has been taken into account in the current version of the draft so the latest update was unfortunately only before I kiev 104 so we described "

    "text": "previous page if you have a networking between the application server and the UPF are you covering the scenario where it\u0027s a non topological route to that UPS so if I understood the question right this is this is exactly the point why we need the policy enforcement point because if we move any any of the two end points either on the application side which is this case or on the UPF side which is the next case we deviate from standard routes so we need host routes which we enforce then on these two points here this is done by the policy controllers according to the scenarios that we described so this is basically the case which we show in three slides that the car moves from the left and right and at some point in time you may take a decision to relocate also the edge serving the the vehicle so as you see here that\u0027s a starting point the vehicle has a UPF assigned from the cellular network and traffic is routed on the n6 interface to the v2x application running on the platform here this is basically the end scenario we are on the right side and in the end we want to continue serving the vehicle from a new max site the we could got a new UPF here and the tracks application also has been relocated in between we try to leverage that DP and overlay on + 6 for this inter site scenario to basically keep that kind of procedure as much as possible independent of the 5g control plane there are scenarios discussed in 3gpp 4 I think it\u0027s part of ultra low latency kind of study and description so here they play a lot with UPF serving as anchor nodes as uplink classifiers and in between they configure a lot these UPF stood erect traffic to the new site so here 3 TPP so it\u0027s pretty much relaxed by just adding in another UPF which can hopefully serve the same you IP address and all the relaying we do on the VPN overlay here so that\u0027s something what we investigate how far this is possible for intradomain but also for inter domain because the mentioned project like 50 Carmen they take a lot of interest in cross-border scenarios which implies into operator and over so there are a lot of technology issues and challenges underneath for inter pyramid over which is not optimally deployed "
