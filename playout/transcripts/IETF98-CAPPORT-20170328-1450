    "text": "chef Easter so just to comment on desert as well so that\u0027s under multiple networks that\u0027s something that we\u0027re trying to solve is the PBS and that\u0027s something that is more general than just captive photos the fact that even on a single link you may have multiple ways of accessing to the network so it could be maybe not the best idea to solve the same problem twice so I think the right way to do it is in the network layer so using arrays and not as part of the captive powerful API so if you want to have multiple ways to multiple captive bottles virtually empty bottles you can provide multiple DVDs using ipv6 proposal and and then do the cap having multiple captive bottles I think that that would be a simpler option than having two layers with twice multiple networks thank you and so we\u0027re almost done as well on the time Carl did you have any very short summary that you want to share the slides are up here Kyle was going to present time permitting but we were having such a good discussion on the other things I think it was probably time better spent on on those just spend a couple of minutes and sort of explain what you did so this is the hackathon on on saturday and sunday yeah so when I this bunch of people in this room actually were at the hackathon working on this so essentially we had a couple laptops wired together um and we put together an API server uh and puts my C\u0026P stuff a client my cmp stuff in the captive portal and made so that when you connect you pretty much you know the instant you try to do something you automatically log in and then you have network access so we implanted the ICMP on the client can be on the cata portal we implemented something kind of like the cow to portal API to describe the draft not quite on the server itself sorry on the con the cap enforcement device itself um we did some tcpdump and Wireshark work to dissect to the captive portal ICP enhancements and I think we also implemented up in plenty in the dhcp server side stuff but never got have really tested it because the client side stuff wasn\u0027t done but no it worked and it was it was actually not that hard to do raw sockets made it pretty easy to do in Linux it\u0027s not perfect but it\u0027s it\u0027s a pretty good proof of concept we could probably keep moving forward to test out and prototype new versions to various drafts and I think it would be neat to sort of have that on going outside of the hackathons pretty much it thanks con and thanks "
