So today, first, we're going to hear from Rafael on the media delivery service. This is bummed for Monday, so now we're going to cover some detail. And after that, we're going to have a discussion on what do we wanna do about delivery service and or transport drafts? either adoption calls or forging a strategy for reducing a document that may later be adopted. And then past that, we'll we're gonna look at some drafts on user discovery, one from Jonathan Rosenberg on Gladys, and then What do we have here? Guyo's hogman on interoperable privacy preserving, user identity, and discovery. for E2EE messaging. Okay. For move on, Rowan? No content. You're absolutely right. I forgot. You are on the agenda just not on this slide. We're I think before user discovery, we're gonna cover the updates to the content format draft from Rowan. which was adopted IETF 116. Thanks for that note, Rowan. Ecker? Yeah. This isn't quite an agenda bash, but I'm not sure where to put into the chair.

Would you like me to drive the slides for you? Mhmm. Good morning. Yes. That works. Alright. So we ended the session on Monday. We somewhat of a heated debate about the layering in the tank, etcetera. So I would like to propose to take a step back from that. And so now I want to talk about the delivery service, which is something that is specific to MLS. And in order to do that, I want to set the stage a little bit. Some folks in here have been intimately involved with the malice over the past years, but not necessarily everybody"

So what you certainly have heard is that MLS can do efficient antenna encryption in groups. there is much more to it. which is highly relevant in the context of Mimi. So MLS also does It is group ship group membership management, meaning there's a notion of a group members get added and removed. And MLS has something to do with that. There is complete cryptographic agreement on who is in a group and who is not. with MLS. That's pretty novel. not something we had in the past with other protocols that were end to end as well, but always only between 2 participants. now we have this notion of a group. And not only can we agree on who is in the group who can, in fact, also agree on arbitrary other data, which is relevant, for example, for the whole policies. stuff. We have a mechanism called extensions for that, and we'll get back to that later. So m l s is an end to an encrypted protocol, which then, obviously, mostly involves clients, However, there's a very natural service side component as well that comes out of and that's what we're gonna talk about today, the context of the delivery service. And finally, MNS can also help you do client authentication. which would also be quite important for the DS. Next slide, please. So, yeah, zooming out again for those who are not super familiar with them, in the MLS architecture document, there are 2 rather apps check components, but MLS requires as a dependency"

    "text": "There's an authentication service, which we're not gonna talk about today. but probably very much in the future, and then there's a delivery service. So the delivery service, I said, it's it's an abstract component that as per that architecture document is responsible for the message ordering mostly and also for making key packages available. Next slide, please. And so a delivery service can come into variants one so the it's quite a mouthful. One's called consistent and partitioning tolerant, and the other one is available in partition to run, but only eventually consistent. So what that means is the first variant is the 1 we're focusing on because it's the one where the message ordering happens in real time With the other variant, the message ordering happens eventually. So this is essentially the difference between the two. And then Monday, we already had agreement that we have this architecture which a hub So, essentially, the the ordering happens on that hub. So what's what we propose in this document now is not just this abstract component, we want to make it much more concrete. So We clearly say the delivery service has a server side component. And there is a delivery service protocol, which the document describes. Next slide, please. So this is slightly different colors what you already saw on Monday. thanks to Richard for that. So In this overall architecture, just as a quick reminder, We have different providers that federate we have the concept of a room A room is essentially a group or a conversation with different members. And we already let out that there is one hub that is responsible for the policy enforcement for the message ordering, etcetera,"

So the flow that is depicted here is what we also saw on Monday, and that is when a message is being sent out. from one of the clients on the upper left, And so everything is in gray except for the two legs of the delivery service called to make it abundantly clear what the exact scope of that is. So the leg 1 starts with the clients and goes all the way to the hub. it channels through the first follow us over, But since it's it's essentially a client server protocol, In essence, the first follow our server inspect those messages, but they're signed by the client. So that's a very important notion. So the the follow server cannot modify those messages. And then the second leg, that is what happens at fan out. So the clients send a message to the hub. The hub is going to inspect that message. And if it's okay, it's going to fan it out to its own clients However, that's not really relevant because that can be a completely proprietary protocol. But what's relevant is that it's going to fan it out to other providers as well. So we need a second lag from the hub to follow our servers. And that one is conceptually much easier because it's really just about forwarding messages. Most of the logic is in the, like, number 1. Next slide, please. Right. So we've covered the legs. And the idea of this delivery service protocol is that it is essentially agnostic of an underlying transport protocol. So this could be HDP, could be NPP, it could be metrics, linear metrics, etcetera. It doesn't care about that. So what"

Next slide, please. Right. Now to the transfer protocol, so the transfer's protocol is a little smaller in scope. So this is not between the clients anymore. So literally between the servers. So this should not come as a surprise at all. I think probably what what most people imagine when I think of a transfer protocol. So again, we have these 2 legs. between the first follow the server to the hub as a message is being sent to the hub And then on the next leg from the hub to the follower. So what we did there is we are proposing a draft call mini over HTTPS. which is really, really slim in that it just describes one endpoint. for each of these legs. and text with serialized messages, tless encoded, takes an over HTTPS. So this is deliberately minimalistic, and not substantial enough going forward. So especially what we completely left out of scope is scalability for that. But we needed a starting point. So that's why we stand today. Whereas, the delivery service in terms of substance is much more comprehensive. Next slide, please."

I think Rowan has coined the term MLS primitives think it's a good one. So these are the operations you can do when you use MMS. So, of course, sending messages by end to end encrypting them inspecting the group membership to see who is in the group adding removing members, updating your own key material, joining a group. So with MLS, we have 4 different ways of doing that. That's what the MS protocol gives you. And so with that, you can actually map that to different situations depending on on how open or close groups are or if an invitation is required, etcetera. whatever the group policy is. And then slightly more opinionated, and that was before Rowan submitted his draft about different kinds of groups. was this initial consensus that we talked about in the interims before now that we would for a certain group type, we would to have one to one connections first, and only then somebody can be added to a group afterwards. So this is whether delivery service is a little bit opinionated, and this is the part that is going to change in the sense that we ultimately need to map all these group policies, so we've agreed on them, for the DS. to support that. The last one is is quite important in my mind. So the state on clients can get corrupted, especially when have large deployments that just happens, it's flip. we need a mechanism for those clients to actually resync with a group, and this is also what the data service protocol provides. some Next slide, please."

We have different ways of combining the policies with MRS. so that we can have instant agreement on it, and there's some transparency we discussed. One is extensions, but we can also do AAD, which is a way to agree on data. So the data is in the clear, so the server can actually see that. However, the server cannot modify it anymore. So it's it transits all the way from a client through the server to other clients. And, yeah, the last one I already mentioned, this is where we are opinionated right now, but we distinguish between 1 to 1 connections and groups in the future, this is gonna be more elaborate, most likely. Next slide, please. authentication. So This maybe comes as bit of a surprise because We are now in a federated environment, and so messages go between domains, you have traffic between domains, and that can be scary. I mean, traffic is scary, and traffic between the men's is even scarier. So the question is What can we do about that? Because we want to have something that is robust in the end. What kind of authentication can we use? And it turns out that we actually already have everything we need for authentication across domains. And that is simply the fact that In these MLS groups, clients are represented with certificates."

I just wanna say that MLS has credentials And a built in credential type is an X 509 certificate, and we can have other credential types, And for the rest of the purposes of this discussion, you can think of certificates. I will henceforth use the term credentials. Yeah. Absolutely right, Ron. Thank you. Right. So there is public key material. make it even more generic. we can use for that. Alright. Next slide, please. So same picture as before, but I deleted leg number 2. So we have the same scope here from the clients to the hub, and this is where we can do the authentication. So the clients are on a different domain. They're on a different provider, And but they're also part of an MLS group on the hub. So that means that they can use are private keys to sign something and to authenticate directly to the hub. Of course, in addition, you can have additional authentication between the servers and whatnot, but it's completely orthogonal to that. Yes. Yeah. John Peterson clarifying questions. So, I mean, is it assumed that, actually, it's only the clients that would have tickets that authenticate themselves or are there cases where the follower servers? would actually possess the necessary information to authenticate with our clients are. because there are some communication systems that have that property. So, like, is this a constraint of the architecture that the client to be the one that holds the start? So this is essentially a kind of MLS -- architecture. So MLS Yes. -- the has this notion of client credentials that hold the private keys and Those are not to be shared with a server by design."

So the public keys that can be anywhere, the public. Yes. So the the hub has the public keys. then the client produces a significant error. But the assumption is it's in the client always. Okay. Right. Yeah. I mean, nobody has ever proposed anything out so far. So let's go with that. I mean sorry. Erica, I mean, That certainly is the assumption that there's no technical reason I'm aware of that you couldn't stuff servers, it would just be an advisable. I think so I think what what John I think is coming at is that there are a number of settings now including telephony where the authentication had come derived from the server. And so in his questions, it can be ported in telephony context. And it would be as have to be, like, obviously, the end to end guarantees will be severely weakened on this. Richard Barnes. Yeah. I I think the way you would think about like, it's left any, like, case here. Is it the the follower server would effectively be acting as the clients that it is authenticating on behalf which, you know, you degrade the end of the same stuff. I think another thing to keep in mind here is that it may be useful to also have server level identity as as well as client today. So I think what Rafael is talking about with the MLS credentials, handles the client level identity. I think it's a it's a a question we should ask whether we also wanna authenticate services Yeah. That that's a good point. I mean, so for the purpose of this protocol, we only talk the client to server authentication. The server to server authentication conceptually I see as something that would happen at the transport layer and not the delivery service layer. Rafael, Well, let me finish this slide. I think I have a question, but I mean, maybe I attached. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Why don't you finish this slide? I think I may have a question, but Okay. -- be able when we are done. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that's it for this slide, and the next slide is the legs. So if you wanna ask a question now, if it's has to do with that? Yeah.

Right? the difference in the hub, I think, in this case, is it has some notion of what of who should be signing things. Right? Right. So I mean so, like, anybody can value his interest, but the hub actually a list theoretically of who should be signing things, and I want to discard them if if if I if I'm not in the room and I'm signing stuff. Right? Yeah. Exactly. So, yeah, this is a good point. Maybe I should just repeat that. In my head is but the the hub, of course, has a list of who's in a group. It holds the ratchet tree. Ratchet tree again holds credentials. And so In terms of separating traffic, So say that the hub is, you know, wide open and accepts traffic from anyone. shouldn't be selling so close to the microphone, I think. Then With that list, you can immediately know whether a request know, is for a specific group and a specific client in that group and and whether that client can actually authenticate. And the rest, you can simply discard. Yes, Basil. Basel on the 4 a. I I guess, a clarifying question. How does Boost Shopping work when a group is created? because the, you know, the server of the hub doesn't know in the rest of the -- Good point. So, initially, you have to create a group on a hub And so I guess the the most vanilla version of doing that is you're only allowed to create groups on your own provider and not on somebody else's provider. Although that could be up for discussion, but let's go with a simple version for now. And so this group only contains yourself. and then you add people. And as you add them, you also add their public keys to the state on the hub. So once they have received the welcome or whatever the mechanism going to be. they can authenticate to the hub, although they've never spoken to the hub before. tab already knows the public key material."

So let me just make explicit what I hear as one of the design choices that we have here. the hub doesn't actually appear to care What follower server a given client came from? Yes. So that is also when Monday, I propose that the first follow server not even that important in theory. In the context of this protocol, clients could go directly to the hub. or come through some other follower server if they have some chance to do that. So so so in this design, I'm fine with this. I just wanna make really clear to the room that the client is associated with the room strictly by the clients, credential. Yes. for the purpose of of of this protocol. For the transport protocol, You know, we could make it a rule that it has to come through a specific follower server. But this protocol doesn't care about that. more questions? is it possible to use this with a Excuse Oh, sorry. I'm John. me. Would you please identify yourself? carbon. Sorry. I haven't signed into that thing yet. is it possible to use this with a group potential so that individual clients are not identified to the server, the hub server. So you you were about the metadata when they're identifying themselves, or what's where is that coming from? Yeah. I mean, Any any communication should not be identified to it to a specific client if possible. Okay. Yeah. We're gonna talk about metadata in a few slides. by the then that will answer your question. So right now, no. There is no groupkeymaterial for that necessarily in the sense that it should be a client that clearly identifies itself also, you know, for reduced prevention, things, right limiting, etcetera.

Sorry? about that? should the system as a whole be attempting to prevent inappropriate group joining and inappropriate message transmission. At? So we're at the at the hub location or not? That is the that is the key design decision. You know, because it's exactly how it's executed, best key design decision. And I think It is it is it is clearly the case. that it is possible to obscure which of multiple group members is transmitting to the hub. in the I think the way Giles kind of implied a minute ago with a group credential. is clearly not the case that is possum and still being tax control. So if you know, you and I and we're winning our group, then you know, then then, you know, Jonathan can't send to the group. Yeah. For the group. But it is clearly not the case that without exposing identities to the the hub, the hub can exclude Jonathan from how to join the group without him don't know who it is. I was just like, I'm the way experience. Right? So I think, you know, maybe take a step back. Do it is the general design that you're going for here. one in which the hub does filter out inappropriate group joins and inappropriate message transmission or not. Yeah.

Rowan, I'm saying something a little different, which is that The protocol allows a hub server to do that, whether the Herb server engages in that behavior or not, is their business. and we don't need to discuss that. It's possible whether it's whether it's a best current practice or whether it's a must. we can decide that later. Okay. Sure. I mean but it seems we have some consensus, but for now, it seems like a good idea. can go into the details later. Yeah. Real customer. I would like to make a good clarifying question. Like, what sorry if this has been mentioned, but, like, what what kind of mess what is the client's signing when when you say client signed the message because, like, I think the server does not have the king key material to, like, decrypt the message itself. So, you know, I mean so the whole protocol a a request response protocol, the the US protocol. And so the requests are being signed with a private key that response to the public key that is on the hub. So the hub has this public key in ClearTax. nothing to do with encryption and and can validate these signatures. So it does not have to do with the MLS message itself. It it has to do with the and request response of the this button. That's correct. Although it is signed with the same key. Yes. Okay. Thank you. There there was one other thing And, again, there's one other thing I wanted to mention here, which is I think that we should let Rafael, get further through his slides before we have non clarifying questions. That's a good plan. Thank you. Yeah. And the spirit of time keeping. I don't know. Is if it's a good one, Vlad? time. quick follow-up to just going back to the group credential point,"

So this from the hub to the follower servers and Again, we go through the Internet here, so it would be nice to have authentication. And so what happens is that So this is specifically for the fan out. And what clients can do Through the first leg, they can provision on the hub whatever their own follow server needs in term of authentication. So this is not super well defined yet because there are multiple ways of doing that. but they can provision a credential, a token, a nouns, whatever makes sense. so that add fan out, the hub can use that to authenticate to the follow-up servers. that's literally the only operation that's happening here is this fan out event. And it's a lot easier. So So in short, we have authentication through 2 different mechanisms, on both legs. Daniel Con Gilmore. Sorry. I know you wanna get through this it seems like the client needs to also indicate where the which follower server needs to use these credential for. Right? So it's not just provisioning the credential. It's provisioning that destination as well. Correct. It provisions, like, the whole setting of destination, how to authenticate to destination.

But if there's multiple followers on the path of the client, are the 2 legs we're considering. So we only consider the first follower for standardization because that's what we need to agree on. Whatever you wanna train behind that is most likely just proprietary, and you can do whatever you want. Okay. Alright. So what state do we have on the server side component? So we were already talked this in in essence. So we have the MLS for a chuting tree that holds the credentials we have the grouping for that. Something that comes out of MLS. And then we have this information for the per client per user authentication and fan out, as I said, We also have key packages. We haven't talked about them yet. It's it's not that interesting. We just need them. It's a public key material we need. And right now, we distinguish again between one to one connections and for now. Next slide, please. So what the server can do is it keeps track of who's in the group. It keeps track of the Russian country, etcetera. So it can do other things we discussed on Monday. Can it the messages, it can reject them. If they don't have the right ordering, it can reject them if they don't abide by whatever policy has been set And then most importantly, it can also help new clients join because as it sees commit coming in and it pans them out, it can update this messaging tree without clients having to upload the whole Russian country every time someone wants to join. every time they invite someone.

And next slide, please. Okay. So I will talk briefly about the reduced metadata variant. So this is a variant of the protocol. So before anyone's heart rate starts to rise, this is optional, but I still want to present this briefly here. So the status quo is that most messengers don't do anything particular to avoid metadata. and oftentimes for good reasons because they're needed for technical reasons. However, the status quo is not the state of the art. The state of the art is that what we have with signal where we have a fairly large deployment, there must be close to a 100,000,000 monthly active users by now, so it counts as something. and they do a lot to avoid metadata. So if Amy wants to be relevant in in terms of modern technology. This is not something we can completely ignore and say, okay. We'll just deal with the whole metadata thing elsewhere. So that is, in essence, why we propose a variance to the protocol that aims to reduce metadata, essentially down to 0 depending on what metadata you look at. So we specifically focus on metadata that is stored on the delivery service."

We also don't try to prevent statistical and behavioral analysis because that's a super hard problem. Next slide, please. this scope here is that, ideally, the protocol So, supports near the same functionality that we have in in the other variant with the full metadata. and also supports the same security mechanism. And so this is where where the complexity actually is because you know, it's nice to not have the metadata. Fine. You you just don't include them, but then how do you do rate limiting? You know, how do you do abuse prevention etcetera. So the idea is to still have all of these mechanisms without needing the actual credentials and the actual identities of clients in a group. So right now, both of these variants are described in the same protocol. Next slide, please. And the mechanism is very high level because it's much grainier than that, but the idea is that the credentials and identifiers they replaced with sodimmons. We have at rest encryption, at different layers, And wherever we cannot do rate limiting on the pseudonyms, we use privacy tasks as a mechanism to issue privacy pass tokens that can then be redeemed, but there is only they're limited, essentially. That way, we can do reg limiting. Next slide, please. So I wanna be very clear on what the downsides are for now at least of them are gonna go away over time.

It also imposes some requirements on the transfer protocol. So far, we don't really have any particular requirements for that transfer protocol. And the obvious requirement here is that the transport protocol does not re add the metadata. We've just tried to straight away, obviously. We also have some requirements regarding certificates and or credentials. There is some complexity in that design. Obviously, is also complexity in the implementations. And fundamentally, this needs more analysis over time and is check here to deploy simply because avoiding metadata means you need to avoid them all the time and not just once. at some point in the stack. Alright. Next slide, please. So the path forward that we're proposing here is that We separate these 2 variants with with a full metadata for now because that's the most generic one. And most likely, the one that is most useful to folks right now. we push the whole metadata minimizing and into a separate document, which has a longer time line, and we iterate on that. Right. Next slide, please. Alright. So this is what a stack could look like aside from identity and credentials, which is not up for discussion right now.

So, conceptually, without going into the details of what's being proposed, This is what the delivery service will enforce And this is also what's then combined into the delivery service protocol. For example, at some point, we have a long list different group types. We have we express them as an enum. with a number for every type, and then that type is what is is gonna be repeated in the delivery service. but the delivery service protocol itself is agnostic of the specific type. It just has an interface to whatever is gonna be defined in the group policies document. Of course, we have MS itself. It needs to be said. And on top of that, in the MLS application messages, we have the message content for which we already have a document. So this is essentially the proposed layering of that stack. Next slide, please. same stack, but we provide an implementation a proof of concept for that as well. So we implemented Almost everything, not to group policies right now because that is too new and not an implementation target just now. And the message content is also just partial really. simply because it's not that important at this stage. Since we have this layering, it's completely coupled.

Alright. I think that was the last slide of the presentation. So now Mike is open again for questions. Just a quick question. On the implementations, are they released anyway? was looking on the other -- Yeah. They're open source, and I do not have the link on the slides, but that can be fixed. Well, which from the The Trepo on GitHub forever, aren't they? It's in the open MLS rep or No. It's on the Phoenix organization. them. appointment link around.

It's all in rust. Yep. Ron, apparent to Europe next. Just as a row inmate. Just as a general comment, I just wanted to say, Yeah. Yeah. when Rafael first proposed first version of this was was, like, very very light on details. Even then, it was this is something we have a we have a charter item to do to do me me with MLS, we're gonna need to explain what the what the implications are on on clients and on hubs or servers or whatever we're calling them.

I think that this is an excellent you know, 70, 80% of the way towards having that, and it also has you know, keeps the door open for the possibility for for ways of doing this metadata reduction. So I think this really very important work for this group. Yeah. That that's a good point. Thank you, Ron. So our initial intuition, at the time when we didn't provide enough details for others to follow that intuition. was that's know, eventually, we're all gonna end up at the same conclusion that that we need something very canonical around MLS, around the delivery service. Because anyone who wants to implement MLS sooner or later, will arrive at that problem. How do I join with where does the key material come from, etcetera. So this has the potential you know, of being really a canonical version of that. And I think Matthew, also mentioned that that's when looking at the interim metrics, and how to plug MLS into that the outcome was something somewhat similar. Yeah. Yeah. Just to respond to that quickly. I think that's probably more for the adoption call, which I guess is in negative 5 seconds from now. But quick question on your draft in general. I remember correctly, it had a an issue where if ever or if all the users' devices were to be logged out or be removed, then the user themselves removed from the group. Is there opportunity for a user to have, say, 0 devices, but still be considered a member of the overall room or group. So the membership is really tied to the MLS membership. So if you don't have any clients in the as group, you cannot do that authentication anymore."

It's not in the draft right now. We would probably have to do discuss the details and implication and the motivation for that, etcetera. but something we can discuss. Yes. Britta. Britta Hale? first of all, just echoing what Rowan already said that we need a delivery service for the MLS, which is already part of our draft So I think this is a great way forward. Obviously, something's needed here. I do really appreciate the effort towards metadata protection. gonna be very important to a lot of messengers. And having that option as a parallel, you have a regular and but having that option, I think, is very valuable for us to be considering in this group. Thank you. I see you. So I guess I wanted to second the importance of the work here in terms of defining how to use MLS for group membership and using it as the the using them, the MLS Primitives effectively like this. I guess that there's a huge concern on this in terms of not actually being applicable for the interoperability aspects for Mimi in terms of providing a solution. the this messaging providers can use today or in the near future, for DMA, digital market type interoperability. And I think there may be a hybrid solution here. where you can have you can use MLS for all the group management without going completely MLS my on the list and requiring the entire thing to be hard coded to using MNS."

And as Ron pointed out, we have maybe not been quick enough to convey what we're trying to do here. However, we have a fully specified draft today, and we have a full implementation as well. So the question how fast you can go with that, really depends on how motivated people are. Jared, is it okay if I throw in one last thing here? Well, yeah, I was gonna ask. Are we really, like, closing out the discussion on this draft and then our next section is about the question that was just raised essentially. So if you wanna talk about this. Yeah. In fact, I think my comment is on a nice kind of hinge point because I I wanted to kind of highlight 2 things. One is that, like, the charter for this working group says that the end to end encryption is based on MLS. We have a bit of an obligation to to to be mailed to that. process wise. And I think that what my takeaway from this kinda stack that Rafael has presented and some of the discussion on Monday. is that there is benefits much like in quick case or in the HTTPS case to having the crypto fairly low in the stack, and I think that's a value that's worth from from keeping in whatever synthesis we end up adopting. I think we do need to have some synthesis among the various proposals before we get something that's that's adaptable. So I think I think those two values, I think, are pretty important to me. I think we have some obligation to do MLS, and I think keeping the crypto fairly low in the stat is something we ought to do. Like I said, based on those quick initial TPS examples, Now that said, I don't think that means this is an we we're we're absolutely stuck to an MLS maximalist approach. I think Quick is a good example in which they are you know, they they are focused on TLS as their crypto layer, and it's integrated, and they get a lot of interop benefit over that. But they have a formal boundary around that. fact, have swapped out. Like, they they started with crypto, which was not TLS."

We can have you know, an architecture that's built around you know, having a security layer at a given point in the stack that we can make progress with. but we can also have some agility there in case folks wanna go off book or try different things, or in case we need to change in the future. Yeah. That's a good point I should have said that in the beginning. So our approach here was to be as material as possible so that things are essentially composable. So that's why we have, you know, the transport and the delivery service as to different things obviously, the group policy is also not baked into that. It's stand alone thing that could be used elsewhere. etcetera, etcetera. Alright. Thank you. Thanks. I didn't kill the slides. So thanks, Rafael. what we have planned to do now or what we had originally planned to do. was that as the chairs we had heard in advance from both the authors of the maybe delivery service and from linearized matrix. that they were, you know, potentially interested in asking for working group adoption of their drafts. This was a couple of weeks ago. And so we had, you know, scheduled this time to talk about that. Obviously, there's been lot of discussion since then and, you know, interesting evolution around both the question how different pieces of these two designs could be merged and also the extent to which Encryption is tightly integrated into the transport protocol and how much of a dependent see that implies on MLS in particular. as Richard pointed out, we do have the dependency on MLS specified in the charter. and put the charter language in the text. But, of course, let's talk about reopening the charter. That's that can be part this discussion as well. So the point of the next 30 minutes is to hear views from those in the working group about what they think the best path forward is here so that we can get to the point of"

That's, of course, fine. or any other you know, flavor that that you think is is the best path here, but we're trying to get a sense of the working group about what the plan should be going forward. So now's the time to do that, and the queue is open. Hi. Hi. Matthew Hobson from Matrix. remember to say my name for once. So first of all, I think everybody is in agreement. The MLS should provide the encryption for MeetMe. And it's in the charts where it's not not up for the base at all. However, as I was saying, I guess, at the end of Rafael section, I'm really concerned that the interoperability piece has been forgotten here. that in the charter, it's literally interoperability first. at least chronologically, and then MLS and second. Now the reality is that the digital markets act may messaging providers and gatekeepers need a solution for interoperability SAP for March. of 2024. which is less than a year away. that needs to be implemented for billions of users in that time frame. to provide 1 to 1 secure communication group comes later. And if that doesn't happen, There is gonna be massive fragmentation. It's in some ways, the excuse that some of the more insular gatekeepers for years in order to go and sort of just say, hey. Use our proprietary API. We're not in it in standards. There is this BIM EDS thing coming out of Mimi, which will be ready in many years. Looks amazing. It's kind of a but cryptographically ideal solution, but we're not gonna use that right now. So I propose that we need to have a protocol provides a migration path simply?"

So the ones that Rafael just presented Well, still critically remaining retaining interoperability with existing, grape Management. So you you have the clients looking after the group management by MLS but you mirror that. Not in a controlling way. The ownership is still on the client side, but at least you mirror it in metadata that can be used in the transport layer that sits love it. linearized matrix in this instance, which means that people who are using linearized matrix today. like the interop demo that we showed at the hackathon with Google. can use it. at the transport layer right now, And then once MLS is rolled out, and I think Google committed few or at least and state of that support firm in us a few days ago, there is then a migration path forwards. We've we've sketched this out over the last couple of days. it looks pretty positive. We've got a kind of one page sketch of how it could look. It's not a formal Internet draft, and we critically haven't implemented it yet. Interestingly, it also supports reduced metadata. for MSC 401 4, which is matrix batching.

So I think it's clear at this point that we're nowhere near ready to adopt either of these drafts. I've reviewed various metrics, and I would put against adoption even though I think it's some new concepts. and it's certainly something who is coming. I don't wanna definitely memorize matrix for obvious reasons. I I've used some interesting elements in maybe yes, but I also don't think it's ready for adoption. So, you know, I also think that, like, trying to hash out all the details of things in ink of what? sixty odd people is definitely not gonna work. So You know, we have 2 traditional, you know, mechanisms we're dealing with. One is to the the the components of the various proposals get together and try to produce immersion. and they come back with immersion. on I guess, 3 ways. to We do a beauty contest, which we'll be we've done about May of 2024. So I think that's probably off the table. And 3, we convene some kind of small design team to try to actually you know, pull the best pieces out of each of these. So I think the question I would ask is, of the proponents of I think you know, so I think it's fair to say we have, like, 2 rep proposals at this point. they think they can get together and produce a document that is a harmonized document that they'll decide on to? And if they can, we should like to do that in the whole time. you want what's the scope. scope of all the work that is on Rafael's slide. And if you can't -- The the stacked diagrams are changed? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like, you need to tile the space. And if they can, then that's great. feel they can't. That's totally understandable.

So my personal view is I I like the linearized matrix view on incremental deployability. I feel this is a widely underappreciated aspect of protocol design here at the IETF where we often have a habit of defining fantastic protocols that are just not easy to roll out and the ones that are successful or ones where we build a path forward. There are practical deadlines that Matthew has outlined. practical considerations that the gatekeepers will have in terms of meeting those deadlines. And if we have a protocol that allows us to get to MLS maybe without starting their day 1. without there being any other destination. I think we're all agreed on that. I think that's a feature. not a bug. I'm just gonna ask a follow-up question now that the these deadlines have been invoked twice. So there's, like, a March 2024 deadline. Yeah. what are people anticipating that we would get done And in what state would the standards be by March 2024? if that's a relevant date for you. in your thinking about this. Who's that question to to me? Yeah. You just invoke the deadline. So -- To me, it's not specifically about the debt And I'm not saying that that I'm saying, in general, making a plea for value of incremental deployability. a and a tool in a in a you have a protocol, that can be gateway with the existing thing without ripping out the existing thing. that's just always gonna be easier to roll out.

In that sense, so the March 2024 deadline, is a difficult one anyway regardless of what's gonna happen.

I don't see any incentive to make that second transition. And I think, in general, The problem we have here isn't a technical problem. It's an incentive problem. The whole question of whether or not these systems interoperate has never been all that technical. They always could have gateway. The question is really what's the incentive for them to make this transition to use a protocol that's a general protocol for interoperability. And especially if they're going to do it once, why would they do it twice? So while I hear the argument that it might be easier to start in something that looks technically closer to 1 or 2 of the existing systems. and then make 2 transitions to achieve the maximalist end state. I actually don't see the incentives lining up to that in any way, shape, or form. And I appreciate the point that Jonathan was making that it is important in some cases to allow for for transitions of this type. And if there were a deep technical issue here transition there, I would agree with him.

The charter has a very strong implication that you start from MLS. and not start from something that may eventually get you to MLS.

Mallory Notles, Center for Democracy Technology. in response to this question of the timeline, the deadline, and what are the incentives. I think it's useful to remember that in March, what's happening is the gatekeepers then self identify, and they propose to the regulatory body how they're going to implement the requirements of the DMA that is placed on them. It's not going to be code. it's going to be a description of what they propose. and why this is useful and why it doesn't need to be finalized and why actually just adopting something like Rafael has proposed here today would be enough is that it will help regulators understand and also people who write in to try to influence that that decision of the regulator. It's also, by the way, not clear if the regulator has any recourse at all to reject a proposal by a gatekeeper, but putting that aside, the actual mechanisms don't matter. The point I'm making is that there's something to compare it to. So if a gatekeeper says, well, we're just gonna do an API. We're just going to wrap this in a bit of duct tape, and that's how we're going to comply with the DMA. That may not be sufficient for privacy.

So there is a necessity necessity for this to work to have a single common cryptographic on core. And the charges for a clear that Core's MLS. And so and so as sort of Ted was saying, attempting to have some sort of, like, double step thing where it's like, we're gonna start by. You're gonna transition only something, but it's gonna be, like, double ratchet or iMessage or whatever. then later with Dallas, there's, like, an incoherent technical notion in in in a actual deployment scenario. on, James. Come mostly came up. It's reacting to some of the date and deadline things from earlier on. I mean, if if you adopted something today, I think you have Sunslim chance of still hitting having a fairly stable spec by the time of the group deadline, and then that would be good. But that that really that the enemy of this working group is time. I mean, by the if we miss all those deadlines and people roll out things that they need to do to meet their legal obligations, which they probably will meet. They're gonna they're gonna have just spent a huge expense to go do something. and they're gonna be not very excited about, as Ted was pointing doing yet another additional rollout again. So I much more end up on the need to make this incrementally and easy to roll out to to to a certain degree. And we we need to move quickly on on this working group. Just so, like, a huge sense of urgency in in adopting things and moving forward because that deadline's coming up so quick. And if we have nothing by those top deadlines, I don't real I don't really see a huge incentive for the for the for the gatekeepers"

Can can you talk about what you view as the difference between effectively given what we know, whose participating today, the difference between the authors getting together and working on some new version of something versus a design team which includes essentially exactly the same people.

I just if we if we've said, like, the design team is just a group of people and whatever they bring back has and no standing relative to anything else that came back, that'd be fine too.

Now terms of what that should look like, let me try and sum up here in the the the remaining 2 speakers behind me, I guess, can object. if I can inject on the list or in Zulik, but it seems to me like I'm taking away kind of two key points from all the discussion we've had here. One that kind of the crypto low in the stack design of the d s the Mimi d s thing is a valuable thing to keep. And, you know, we should investigate how how you can kinda make a real design that that incorporates that or or more kind of complete design that that incorporates that aspect but also the linearized matrix stuff is more real today. It's more of a complete them today. And so I think that what I would encourage a design team to focus on is seeing if we can re slice linearized matrix so that it has that crypto low end stack. property.

Basel Mifore. one of the I mean, one of the things that kind of I thinking a lot about this in here. A lot of people talking about it. One of the things that the like, the DS proposal requires is MLS first to be deployed in order for the transfer player to be implemented, which I think for I mean, maybe I'm understanding it mistakenly, but I'm happy to be corrected. And then if that's kind of the case, it might make it harder for a lot of the gatekeepers to be able to paralyze the work.

So having that as a pre requirement for being able to participate interoperability means that we'll push the gatekeepers not to be able to kind of meet like, whatever deadlines that they would have to do versus having something that might potentially be able to be incremental might allow us to be able to kind of get that like, process working together. And so and it seems to me like there's a lot of disagreement how to approach this. So I don't necessarily think adoption today is the right path. I think we need to be able to kind of think about this. think about how like, you know, other potential gatekeepers might approach, you know, these proposals to be able to kind of get something that would actually be adopted as opposed to, stay as an RC that is not really adopted at the cross industry.

Whereas by keeping that abstraction in place, it provides the necessary on ramp. And that's a really critical concrete reason why we don't think that we should bet the farm right now on hardcoding everything to the mini to the MLS. primitives. in in answer to everybody who said, I haven't heard a good reason. This is the one reason that we have 2 options. Either the really idealistic long term, everything on the m and s script 2, permitatives, which, you know, I like. For the records, in the long term, I think it's an amazing opportunity to build a decentralized, produced metadata, signal killer. but it won't solve the interoperability problem.

And in its position, the network, there's some ability to help help, not fully stop, but help prevent those things. And I think that's goodness. So the rest sort of falls out from these assumptions. There's a query protocol. I'm not even gonna bother. There's a query protocol. the app provider can go to glass provider map this phone number, it gets a response, and then There's multiple Gladys providers. How do they exchange routing information? in order to sort of limit the amount of information flow between that stored. They change basically Bloom filters."

So That's it. That's the idea behind this thing. welcome feedback. Cool. Probably wanna take it on the list. presentation. I'm around. Is that okay? unfortunately because we're out of time. Yeah. We have one more one more Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the time. Oh, and I got a sticker for participating. Giles, you're you're up So, yeah, we're gonna present The the Google proposal for identity and discovery. Next slide. So requirements a very simple, Alice wants to message Bob. Alice want needs to know bulbs key material and which endpoint to deliver the message to And then second one is if if if Bob has multiple clients, then you might wanna receive the message on a preferred client, so that's part of the design as well. Next. So but the privacy requirements here are more complicated we wanna make sure that We don't need the social graph. So resolver any resolver identity service shouldn't learn the user ID that the the client is querying for. And, obviously, also the the identity of the the query and client and the timing of the message sent Next, But"

Trump Next, please. So we skip that slide. Yeah. So we we we considered 3 different architectures I'm gonna go through the the ones we've discounted first real real quick. Like, the the first idea is You just kinda brute force query you you have a a baked in list of key distribution services and you just kind of brute force query them. That's obviously, doesn't work because it's expensive for the client. And even if you do it on the server side, it It's it's too expensive. and also it leaks the private information of who you're querying to potentially to a service that you're not actually signed up for. So it doesn't work from a privacy point of view either. next slide, please. The second option we can it and discounted is a centralized key key distribution service where I mean, I think that is basically what you were proposing and Yeah. But but I think even even multiple, like, aggregated key services we we we don't think that would work. because you would have to get it's it's too complicated, politically, basically, that you'd have to get multiple providers to all cooperate and somebody has to pay for it. And"

    "text": "we we don't think that's the best best route here. next slide. So the next the the one that we we have a in this proposal that we've settled on is basically a DNS like model where each Each provider provide publishes an authoritative mapping like in DNS. And then the other providers are free to replicate that or to query the authority with authoritative map mapping And then the query is made by each client to its some front end, And Crucially, we also have built in a privacy private information retrieval protocol here. that prevents any of those resolve is who didn't already know the mapping sorry. Who didn't already know the the recipient from learning who you're about to to contact. next week's So I and, obviously, I'm not gonna go through all of this, but We we there's basically 2 3 phases here. So you start off with defining your name server, muffing, And then the the the requesting client front end is is can replicate those name records just like in DNS And then the next phase phase 2 is that a the the client makes a private information retrieval query, to the the name service, and gets the list of key distribution services that"

And then once you have that, then you you you query for the actual key material from the standard key distribution service that each each platform already offers. And The cool thing about this is it it it doesn't require anybody to build a new key to attribution service. They can use their existing key distribution service. And next Next slide. And and then message literally works in a similar way that you query the name service, And then once you figure it out, What the supported services are, for for a given user, then you send to the deliver the delivery service And one point here is that the The recipient So I shouldn't say phone number. The recipient user ID is tunneled through the front end of the of the sender platform because they shouldn't learn dotdot They they don't need to learn that, and they shouldn't learn that. Next piece. And then, finally, the the specification of a preferred client to receive messages on We we have a proposal for that where I basically you you can also register that with the name service, and it's authenticated by the same private key that be used to encrypt the messages. next, So so FEMI is gonna very briefly run through the private information retrieval part of this."

So We leverage private information retrieval scheme that's supposed to be more if you can quick chance Basically, you are able to perform arrity 20 corporations on Syphratech without forced decrypt in it. Next slide. So how does the PR scheme walk This is just a quick prima, you assume it did have a hold your record on the left 1 to 5. and the user is interested in retrieving 1 of the record. In this example, the user is interested in rekind being the record for. Next slide. So what the user would do is to represent her query as a bit ring, where all the bits has zero except at the index of interest. it is set to 1. then it will encrypt those individual updates and forward the target query to discover. deserve perform this side aspect of PIR basically doing DIY's multiplication. to get your result and the individual product are still encrypted. Isabelad does his submission which is the summation of the record of interest, but the star doesn't know that that is the and it forwards that back to the client, and the client is able to decrypt that with our private key, to land the record at that indirect I think the main point here is that the server doesn't land direct call that the user retrieve which is the indexing discretes or the the record audio index.

It does that. and make existing seem much more efficient. So the way this work is you, first of all, share the database into smaller pieces, and then do your PIR over that data. Next slide, please. So This had a cost estimates that we are look we are looking at. So we assume the Main trade off that we make is that for a big database, we shut it into smaller pieces, where it's shot as a million entries each So the table on the right had the performance number we have. the force perform the force of 14 megabyte is an offline download that the client needs to do The client only needs to do it once. He doesn't do it query, So the second upload bandwidth pack query that is the query a query cost similarly to the download, which is 21. and the client time to compute and decrease their response is point one second. and the server, the amount of time it takes for the server on a single thread is about a second. So with this trade off, within the performance is reasonable. Yeah. And and and just to be clear, that's assuming aa A database of 10,000,000,000 record 10,000,000,000 name record.

We're we're very keen on getting this adopted or Just a clarifying question. Daniel Gilmore, is are these figures here for querying within one shard of this set or they for the querying across all the charts? for a long shot. Thank you. Well, obviously, it's parallel parallelizable. Matthew Hudson Matrix, I just wanted to echo Giles's point that that from a mini working group perspective, figuring out the discovery and the identity lookup. The problem is first unsolved totally critical for the entire thing to work at all. It won't be a much, much better use of our collective brains than potentially crippling over the layering. on the I'm a less blower above the question. Yeah. And if if I could do also just make one more point that I I think going a little bit over and then above for the privacy guarantees here. is really important because like, you know, one 1 press article, dissing that that points out critical privacy flaws here is probably enough to kill adoption So I think, like, this may seem a little bit max of 2 max in the list.
