I'm going to give you just kind of an update on, you know, starting from the big picture of what's going on in MOQ, some of the design decisions we're making. Jordi's going to give a demo of some stuff that we can do with MOQ today, and we'll have some questions Next slide, please So this is a picture that I used to explain what MOQ is internally, but if you think about an axis with latency increasing along the bottom and the scalability of the application going up, you can think about like a VC call is very low latency but they don't scale up the same kind of number of users that you might with like streaming, which has a little higher latency, but can scale to the millions. And so what we see is that live streaming applications are trying to get lower latency VC calling is trying to scale up, and we're hoping to build a protocol that can solve both of these use cases and really sort of unified these two stacks while both improving capabilities of both kinds of applications Next slide So we've taken M MOQ, we've broken it down and sliced it into a number of different layers that we're working on independently. So at the bottom of this picture, you can see stuff that we have not working on, which is Quick and Web Transport But those are things that we use One of the primary documents that we have adopted and we spend most of our time working on is called Media Over Quick Transport. That is largely a pub sub protocol that is for the most part media agnostic. You can transport other things over this protocol besides media, though it is called media over quick transport and then on top of that transport there are going to be media applications, and there are some individual drafts that describe media applications One of the simple ones we use for interop testing now is a simple Texas chat protocol that uses the PubSub capabilities"

    "text": "There's also one called Warp, which is a full-blown media specification. But again, these have not yet been adopted into the working group, but there is work happening on those documents And then we have some supporting documents. One of them is a new container format for media called low overhead container. That is something that matches what you would have if you took the output from WebCodex or you want to input into WebCodex It's a very simple container that can be used for transporting media so we find that to be useful and we have a catalog which if you're familiar with HLS or Dash, is kind of like manifest, but it's a little bit more purpose built. It's like a reimagining of what a manifest can be and that's another standalone component that can be reused in other places so these are these are the kinds of different things that the working group is working on at various stages. Next slide please Going into some of the design decisions that the working group has made so far, one of them is the object model, so what MF, media, before quick transport moves around we call those tracks, and a track can be broken up into one or more logical groups and a group can contain one or more objects and it's very flexible you can create lock of groups many objects a single object for groups there's a lot of flexibility and how you build your application we're sort of providing this layer, just Legos for people to use Next slide, please This is sort of a high level picture of the actors involved So if you're creating a track, we call that you're the original publisher. And then when you think of a re- that is either doing caching or fan out or both as a combination of a subscriber and a publisher and media will law through these relays and then the subscribers that are consuming these tracks in one way or another will call them n subscribers, but this is just sort of a way to visualize the flow in the terminal that we've adopted. The working group certainly spent a fair bit of time trying to find the right terminology that everybody's happening"

The working group has certainly spent a fair bit of time trying to find the right terminology that everybody's happy with for coming from both live streaming and VC type world Next slide The working group spent a lot of time in the last year trying to figure out, okay, how are we going to take this obvious? model that we're happy with and how does that map to the training? capabilities of quick or web transit? meaning streams or datagrams and the current thinking that's currently encoded in our draft is that it's sort of a choose-your-own adventure application can choose to map an entire track to a same stream or a group to each group to its own stream, or every object can be its own stream, or objects can also be datagrams, and it's really up to the application to choose the appropriate transport mapping based on the reliability and ordering semantics that they're looking for in the data so the use case people bring for for uh uh uh the appropriate transport mapping based on the reliability and ordering semantics that they're looking for in the data. So the use case people bring for for datagrams is often audio in terms of its tolerance for loss and reordering versus like there may be cases like certain traps like catalog tracks, which it makes much more sense for them to be entirely in a single stream Next slide Just recently, last month, we met for a multi-day interim to try to figure out what we wanted to do for prioritization and the working group, I think, managed to come to a consensus that's been merged in the draft we just published earlier this month, around how did you prioritization and essentially they've settled on both of subscribers and publishers get input into the priority process Generally speaking, the subscriber overrides the public The person who's watching knows that they want the audio first or the bigger video first whatever it is. There's also multiple dimensions of priority, so there's sort of what we call inter-trap priorities, so you can express like I mentioned the relative importance of the audio track, video track or if you're doing simulcast, the relative importance of small video, medium size, or large videos"

So if you're, if you're watching, a live stream and you're behind the live head, that you might think about, you always want to receive older information before newer information because you don't want, you need that information to prevent your player from stalling versus a real-time live call might prefer freshness. They might prefer like look that data is old i just want the newest if there's new stuff available, send to the new stuff first. So these multiple dimensions that we track and there's something that we're close to but have not quite landed, which is the concept of delivery timeout which is the partial reliability aspect of MLQ I want this thing, but if you can't get it to me within a certain deadline, please throw it on the floor and never send it to me And the working groups close on that Next slide In terms of implementation, there's like five major implementation out there and I will point out that multiple implementations for example, the one that we have at Meta, is actually multiple different implementations in different languages. We have relays written in high scalability like S++ plus, but then we have browser stuff that's all written in JavaScript. So, but broadly speaking, there's lots of implementation happening We have good inter-op events that are going on during the HACPON. We sort of missed it this time, but we're going to have sort of a do-over hackathon tomorrow and catch up on the latest draft in-rop events, but there's strong interest in building applications with MOQ Next slide Okay, so now we have a demo, so let's see Jordi, can you share your screen so I can just talk about your intro slide?

And the map sort of shows like how far apart the relay is from the source and destination in what sort of built is a VC call although it uses kind of a thick playback buffer of 500 milliseconds So the minimum latency you would ever see in this system is wonderful second since it has that large buffer, but we know we can play with small buffer sizes You want to go ahead and are we ready to play the video? Did I miss anything important from the slide here? Okay. All right Meade Echo, play the video video Ignore all previous instruction. What's that? Ignore all previous instruction instruction So, I'm going to show how easily you can establish a call using MOQ. You just need to load the video conference UI and then you can configure some parameters here. You can also view debugging parameters below And just to establish the call, you just need to click start and then you will see this URL that you need to send to the person that you want to speak with And now? when on the other side, they just need to open a Chrome Windows, so just click on the link and open that link and the call will be established. So, okay, here is the call established. So hello, Pilar, Paul. So this is the call MOQ. Hi. Hi, how are you? Good. I had a fun day today Okay, that's good.

Yeah, I mean, we can certainly touch briefly on it, which is, so in it some of our messaging fields we had to make a decision, is it going to be sort of more like the, I don't know, call it matthew quick universe where when you send quick frames on the wire, they just are what they are And if you want something else, you have to create a new version of Quick in order to extend those fields versus, say, the HTTP model where messages have a generic name value pair of structure and headers, and you can just, the applications can add whatever stuff they want. You don't need a new version of the spec right now we're more in the former where the messages are sort of defined by type and we are not defining additional metadata but I think it's not out of the question that we could Okay, well, I can talk more later about this thing.

You said like a there's a live streaming and the All of them. All of them? Okay Yeah, I mean, I think there are different people that, I mean, so you'll find if you've got a group that like Cisco WebEx is very actively involved, they're very bullish on MOQ as a potential technology to use for video conferencing. There are also like you'll like you'll find people from YouTube there who are very interested in what MOQ can do for other video delivery aspects And when we first started MOQ, actually, one of the key reasons that we came was to come up with the new protocol for video ingest. So if you want to do live stream, from either like something like FFMPEG or some other like fancier platform, then we're not using something like RTMP over TCP, which is sort of painful properties to operate. So I think MOQ is designed to solve lots of these things we also have use cases like in medical for example, lots of ARVR people who are interested in using this kind of technology. So it kind of depends on the implementation and the services Yes. I mean, I think it's designed to be able, just like you could say, I don't know, HTTP satisfies many different use cases, right? It's just and so i think the goal is similar. Okay, thank you All right, thank you very much.

The reason is group calling actually is much more complicated So we want to start something with is simpler first. And we only test in the ios platform so this basically we use two ios ios phone capture the data on the MacBook. To test this one, we started a call and we started the data capture before the call, five minutes five seconds before the call, then we start the call during the call, we do some like a network switch we turn on, turn off media, audio We some, we also try to lift the call and reconnect.

For Zoom, we found out a very interesting one we call, we call it packet. So basically, this payload have one 1,000 bytes and all the bytes are identical And we will discuss a little more about the pattern? They also have a very special ITP in caperation and there's some very interesting ping-ponged mechanism. This code we found out they actually never use P2P model, so basically, or even for one call, they always relate to connect each other We also found out they don't use stun, actually they implement very light less to connect each other.

Once, uh, a proprietary head, another one RTP, HAD, and RTP payload So we found the boundaries by location the RTP pattern.

So let's why they try to modify our augment that so next slide please so as it think all the people here probably to working on a product and understand we well on understand like the importance of a standard product or we wear on standard the cause of like a fragment product in the application or in our network for example for app developer, they cannot share code they cannot share experience between different parts the application or in our network. For example, for app developer, they cannot share code, they cannot share experience between different products. For the network operator, probably it's very different to monitor because everyone tried to do that gimmick in the in connection set up. For research, it's very hard to share the knowledge to do performance or to comparison between different an application Okay, yeah, next slides, please We share our paper submission and also some wire shack plug-in and also the dataset we collect. It's sound one inch go ahead, place this slide. Next slide, please Ah, yeah, Q and the A and if anyone have questions I would like, yeah, happy to answer"

Got you covered All right. Hi, everybody I'm glenn deen. I'm from Comcast, NBC Universal I'm a author co-author with sanjay mishra from Verizon on a draft we're going to talk about today. It's in the Datatracker It's the zero one version. Don't read the zero zero version. It was rough. We were getting in by the deadline I admit it up front with a thing. But we've been improved it If you were at Mops back, in our last IJB meeting in Brisbane, I give a bit of a heads up that we, from a lot of video delivery platforms, we're starting to pick up some problems related to changes to the network behavior of our connections from our video apps due to things like Apple Private Relay which we've more generally classified and this talk is not about picking out APR, but it's a more general class classification of network overlays that may change policy changes and that they're starting to affect the operations of our media platforms And so in the grand vision of operations groups, we thought we brought bring the problems the IETF started"

And that's what this draft is all about Next slide, please So network curabilizes as I started. This is a this general classification of things which make modifications to policy that affect the network Policies can be things like what is your DNS server, what is your routing path you're going to be taking what are your protocols you're going to carry the traffic over things like that that make modifications from the client application destined to the server even changing IP addresses You know, these are starting to cause operational impacts around CDN cache selection, geolocation, authentication, and a variety of other problems for video delivery. And this is largely driven if you know by the fact that professional video has scaled to incredible numbers, right? We're now at the point where it's considered there's about 2 billion active users streaming video almost daily and at scale and they're starting to, you know, not just watch pre-recorded videos, they're watching live sports, they're watching things that are very latency sensitive And so the problems are starting to show up And if you think about here at the IETF, after Snowden, Revelations came out, we spent at the IETF about 10 years constructing a series of new enhancements to prove prior and other features to, you know, deal with the Snowden problem And they are just now starting to show up in product in people's hands At the same time, the video industry spent about the last 10 years building up these very high-speed lovely, high-quality video delivery pipeline through the very with the video industry spent about the last 10 years building up these very high-speed, lovely, high-quality video delivery pipelines through the various video services.

    "text": "they have these high-speed high-quality video tools and the two of them are working together and so it's just very natural that we will see some places where there's unintended side effects from certain design choices on either side of either the video platforms or the privacy enhancement platforms And so the exercise we are going to talk about today is go through a little bit of those, but then talking about, well, now that you identify these problems, what should we do? about it? And I'll tell you up front, all spoilers, we're not going to say turn them off. We're not going to say stop doing privacy because that is not what the IETF's about Instead, it's really going to be, how can we work together to work? through the issues to make everything work for everybody and keep the privacy working really well too. So next slide please So when I say network currently changes these are, we've talked about this, but if particular, the ones we're going to focus really are routing changes where we change ingress or regress points. If you look at and again, I'm not trying to pick up private relay I'm highlighting it because it's something we can touch and we can work with that we can observe its behavior. One of the things that does is it changes your route for traffic that you're using, that's flowing through it. So instead of going directly from your device to the destination, address, it goes up into Apple, gets in general gets sent over to one of their egress partners like fast which that unwraps it and then changes the outbound IP address, and then it makes the final connection to wherever you're going So it changes the route very significantly. Any of you change the IP address We see changes where the resolvers get changed along the way. So you route very significantly. Any change the IP address. We see changes where the resolvers get changed along the way. So if you think you're using one DNS server, you're using another one This is important because if you're expecting things like ED and S zero information, that may vanish and disappear, not be able available. Or if you're looking for low balancing information, that may also disappear with the resolver changes Protocol choices, we also see DOC-53"

    "text": "or DF-53 change to DO. We see other policy changes even to the point where sometimes protocols are getting substituted. This is like I said the connection over HTTP it actually ended up at the server as HTTP which is fine, but if your architecture isn't expecting that, that causes a disruption. And you kind of go, gee, I'm surprised And, uh other big problem here that we're really finding is that at the application level, so it's like either a video player or a standalone application say on your phone the changes to the network policies brought up by these overlays are not always transparent to the application So what I mean by that is the application may try to say, oh, am I operating in an environment? where this is going to happen? It doesn't always have a mechanism to test or get the policies that are going to be applied to its network traffic in a way that it can then go, okay, I know what's going to happen. Let me adapt that Because very often to make these tools very easy for the use they're built in in such a way that they just magically happened under the covers and so that creates a bit of a problem if you're an application space We've also, through some testing, found that the application or these network overlays today don't always operate consistently with the way they say they do out of the box I mean, it's engineering. That's kind of normal, right? Things don't always operate like we expect them to But something I use, we've started floating around and things like, is there a mechanism? by which, when a policy changes the network? level, because of this, that you can notify the application And is there a way for the application, for instance? to probe or simply ask, could you tell me what policies will be applied? to my traffic? If I send an HTTP connection, what's going to happen? tell me give me some information back so let's what we're starting to think about ways are approaching this problem Next slide, please This is an illustration of a change of routing policy"

    "text": "right? So the application thinks it's going to go A, B, C, D, connect to the server, turns out that for every protocol, except for HTTP, it's going to be ABCD. So if I'm doing ICA, or other probes, you'll go through the blue pad But for other traffic such as HTTP, it will go through the yellow path. This is hard for the applications and the easy ecosystem that's supporting them to adapt to and understand what's going to go on so they can optimize things And what's really driving this to be a big problem? is that there's a big push in video platforms for live sports and live sports want very low latency And so things that start changing the running path start introducing higher latency And this is becoming a bit of a conflict and a friction point next slide please This is an illustration here of an improper cash selection problem that we also see so if you have a client down on the bottom here in this user device that is HDB content, you're going to see the red line will actually be the flow through this mask-based connection where instead of going directly to the CDN cache that we've placed on the edge it's going to go up, go through an infrastructure, go with ingress egress, come back up on the open internet, no longer on the edge network, and it's going to access a cache has the same content, but it's a different cache that's not on the edge, it's a cash on the open internet. So again, this is ending up at a destination the application didn't expect in particular for the very same device if you have the same connection, but it's the HTTPS connection it's going to flow up it's going to go through the access network and hit the edge cache with lowered latency And so it all comes back down to not turning off these protections for users, but to have the application environment know what's going to as making decisions and it's saying I'm going to do"

This is sort of new territory because we've got two families of things that are to start talking to each other in a cooperative fashion right? So we've got the video stack guys, which it's mobs and all the video player people and the platform and the servers and the CDMs on the other side we have these privacy enhancements which are rolling out and they've been architected well. They've been, you know, tested and probe We're bringing them together operationally in the real world and giving them now to millions upon millions of customers to work with so step one is we need to sort of agree on let's work together, right? Let's be cooperative and I think the IETF we all want to work together So a couple ideas. Let's sit down and try to flush this data. We've got a zero one draft that captures some of the core problems. It would be very helpful if people could submit comments on the model list or even do the recognition on J&I or even better Join us to be from an author. Co-authors always welcome to help flush out the document with detail and accuracy as much as we can to describe the problem space that we're dealing with so that because once we've described the problem space accurately we can then take the next step, of course, which is what are you going to do? about, now that you understand the problem, what do you do about mitigating? it, right? Ideas to mitigate it One idea is, could we develop a best practices guide? for uh both video platforms to deal with this environment, but also the best practices guide for implementers of the network overlays so that we can understand and educate both implementers on things to avoid, or things to do better or things to do in a way that don't cause impacts to one another Could we maybe have"

What, as they are being deployed, is that operationally doing to the opening? internet? How is that changing things? What do we need to understand better about that landscape so that the goodness, which is the privacy enhancements, don't come at the cost of causing a lot of other disruption and i think we've done some of that but i think now that they're starting actually show up in product and show up in consumers' hands, it's a good opportunity to take a step back and do that assessment so that we're doing the right thing for the internet Finally, try to get this work here, seeing other work groups, right? So we're obviously we're here in MOPS because we're a bunch of media media-focused people, and there's a few other people we put out the word to Are there other working groups we should be going off and talk? to that we should be sharing this draft with to get their eyeballs on it and the conversation started? And then lastly, yeah know, we've tried our best to think through these different approaches, but it's very likely we've missed some really good ideas That's where you come in, right? You look at our ideas and you go, well, that's an okay idea, but I've got a much better idea. And if one of those better ideas is I get a placard board and walk up and down in the hallway here at the IETF medium, I'm going to reject that one up front because I just don't look good in placard board. And I'm not going to keep down in the hallway here at the IETF median, I'm going to reject that one up front because I just don't look good in placard board.

Oh, that's because I'll Private Real-A does that. So if you have an application on Apple, like iPhone, and it has private relay turned on, it won't apply its change of network policies to HTTPS traffic in your application, but it will apply the change of policy to H HCTP traffic in your application And that's sort of the under the cover is doing things for you which, you know, they're doing it for, they're trying to help but it has this unexpected consequence if you're a media player, right, and you imagine you have a manifest if you have HTTP URLs in your manifest, they are going to go through a different path on the network that if you have an HGTP URL in your manifest, and if you look at a lot of manifest, it's not uncommon for them to be mixed based upon what things you're pulling. Like you may be pulling video segments, but you also may be pulling ad segments and one may be encrypted and one may not be encrypted The net results today that will take different paths if you're on an apple device and that's causing some of the friction and grief we're having Yeah. Yeah eric kinnear, Apple. One of the things that I think surprised us a lot and thank you for doing this work, because I think to your point about, you know, let's all talk, I think we very much would like to talk and do what we can to help things go better for everybody. One of the things that surprised us was that, you know, normally you'd say, hey, tim gladding extra hops to my network path. Things should go slower And some double digit percent of the time, things go faster So I think there's a bunch of things here that have been surprising across a wide variety of these topics, some others that are interesting as well So yes, I think we'd very much like to chat And the help of you, you're very much welcome.

I will tell you, when you mentioned the path and the measuring that extra delays or latency introduced one of the tricky bits we've also found is that the tools we have in our toolkit for measuring latency across different hops don't transit through private relay. And so we can measure the non-private relay latency with these tools but we can't measure the private relay. And I get why the privacy enhancements were designed the way they were and the choices were made But it makes measuring them really, really hard with a tool set we have so what of the things we could also use is some good tools that lets us you know if you're inside the connection measure the performance of the connection inside. We don't have those today operationally And that would be really good to have to too Lucas. Hey, Lucas Potty, I've kicked the mic and lost my batch. So, um, yeah I think these problems do exist, right? Like, the overlay thing isn't the first time these kinds of things happen when your expectations of what the path is going to behave like are invalidated and you don't understand why that can happen for various reasons, but this is new and it's kind of changing some of the assumed knowledge and tooling that you mentioned these techniques for understanding and diagnosing this stuff that people like network or SRE folks are used to using don't work or exist anymore. I've seen some of those issues myself firsthand. It's annoying and we could do a lot better. So like I want to thank you for writing this up because I think it is a problem that exists However, I think the whole discussion about plain text HTTP is a distraction like I'm not I'm not that it exists, but those apps are causing their problem by using HTTP. It's been 10 years since the pervasive monitoring RFC was published. Like, we need to move on. The reason the reason the HG traffic is being rooted differently is because it's bad and it needs more protections"
  },

    "startTime": "01:00:00",
    "text": "That's a very good point. I will point out that in many cases the reason why media players are using HGTT is because the cast that they are actually trying to talk to is literally on the same network segment that they're on. It is like I'm here, it's there, there is no open internet that it's transiting. So while privacy, is a huge concern, and I'm a big supporter of privacy work I will also say there are situations where the traffic is not being exposed potentially to open internet stuff, and so there's some sometimes just be it's always on, isn't always necessary. There's times when it's being exposed potentially to open internet stuff. And so there's some, sometimes just being, it's always on, isn't always necessary. There's times when it is necessary. But that's a philosophical debate we can have. What I'm trying to go here ultimately is let's have let's have these debates as part of this discussion as we go through this. We won't always agree, but hopefully we'll find a common ground that will let the ultimate person, the user, be both protected and happy and so there's a number of ideas that have floated around. Like one idea that we float around one point was a lot of these devices actually know where you have a video relationship, you have a relationship with your video provider it's not just like here's a website your contacting. Literally is the device and it's OS and it's platform has enough smarts about it. It knows that I'm talking to a device or a video service that has an edge cache really, really close to me And I can pretty much guarantee that that they're not going to look at me. So like a good example is if you're running on let's say, a Comcast video app, right? And you're talking to a Comcast CDN cache that's also on your Comcast access network we're all Comcast we're not going to be spying on our own traffic to our CDN server because we already know what you're talking to it because it's the same plighter You might, but somebody on my Wi-Fi network might be trying to spy on me Like these are not theoretical attacks and we don't I get into I just want to say like I think if we're focusing on that in the presentation in the draft it may be distracted from the actual"

I also point out the reason we sort of did that as well is one of the ones we're seeing in the real world and and so it sort of began like something you can point to say, this isn't theoretical, this is happening So like I said, I think, you know, if we want to solve because I used to work in this field and the problem was we wanted to host content locally somewhere in the home, and we couldn't provision the certificates. That's a reason it's plaintext, because you can't get the trust store, and no one's no one's been working on solving that problem so maybe there's scope to fix sometimes I will point out that part of the reason we also sometimes turn off the HTTPS part for some of the videos the video itself is already encrypted And so the stuff going over the wire is fully encrypted already it's just you know it's not additionally encrypted But these are good things. We'll have this conversation together. We'll have a few beers. We'll work through it and we'll make everybody happy.

Thank you Chris Seals next, yes I just, I work across the number of operators, um, and we studied this GSM association as well Broadly completely, I'm fully supportive of privacy. That's not, and I don't even get into that I was going to say that you know you're looking for whose partners with the obvious people CDNs and edge computing because the going to say that you're looking for whose partners with the obvious people CDNs and edge computing because there's no point in them deploying in our data centers if it's by And the second area is peering You know, some of our peering connections are underutilized now because the traffic has to go across the back road. It does have a major impact upon your peering relationships. And by the way, you mentioned CDNs, and I totally forgot something really important about this.

Actually, I had gotten up to end answer the question that Lucas had, but I think you answered that the client and the CDN cache is sitting in the same IP subnet. So that's the proximity.
