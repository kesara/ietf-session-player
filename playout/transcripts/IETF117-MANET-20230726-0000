So but in this presentation, I will want to to clearly state that we need to focus on the general concepts, the the idea and the mechanism itself. So the core part basically is topology updates will be triggered by the change of the ongoing communication relation instead of change of the topologies to self.

So so what's a how do we use that single radius value? So The nice thing is if need to launch a new application from a tod You'll first check if the single radius value is okay for you to do that or not. So you for instance, form a to d, you check basically the number of of hops, And if you find that's hash value between aandb, the same, which means from aandb, You can reach, your topology information is the same, then you check whether the single radius value from the b is larger or equal to n-2.

Question number 1, If a, b, and c form a triangle, then I'm not sure how your radius value works. because b set if I'm a, and b sends me a a topology update. So I increment my my sync radius now goes up to 1. C sends me an update. my Synchrony's. Now it goes up to 2. No. But, actually okay. I may have misunderstood that. Yeah.

And then when the the c joins, first, it resets. because I'm I'm I'm one of my neighbor changes Right?

And, like, this the the only bottom. Like, a lot a lot of times, the major feature validated to 11. Everyone seems to come with its own power save. and light sleep and deep sleep. In its own congestion management, there's a Nesh Beacon Collision avoidance feature and a way to reserve airtime and so on and so forth. But the the the mesh the path selection protocol identifier"

So what would you really do if you were this project that primarily, you would write an IFT i e d f r f c, specifying how you use Babil as the routing product method inside 8 or 211 mesh. You could also specify how to use 1 or more Babble link metric. for example, this graft, which is fairly far along. I'm gonna pop out pretty soon. on a round trip time extension to babble, which uses a derivative of round trip time with appropriate history, system limiting. as the league metric. And tertiary, I said, I'm not sure if tertiary is really a word, but sort of 80211 for Babble. 80211 uses a airtime link metric. the first approximation is how long it takes to broadcast an 8 kilobyte packet. for acting a frame. Data 2 is the frame of the packet. And so it's the airtime used by that, which depends of course on the current link characteristics so that a radio link. And you could use that in in babble. Next slide. It would be simpler to do a path solution protocol based on Babbel than the existing Babble protocol in a few ways. it wouldn't need to have IP prefixes and longest batch and stuff. Just deal with MAC addresses. There wouldn't be the router ID and address differentiation. You can use MAC addresses for everything. You wouldn't need the battle security features, which are in 2 other RFCs, one which provides authentication, you know, that provides encryption as well. because 8 to 211 has its own security. Similarly, you wouldn't, like, 211 has its own multicast stuff with So you don't have to worry about that. It'd be somewhat of a simpler protocol. and they was very flexible on link metric, And so it should work well if you just use it with the existing 8 or 2 airtime metric"

    "text": "is already implemented and supported Next slide. We do have explicit permission or formative 211 to do this. There was a presentation made to the May meeting this year, you can go look at the slides. Everything in 802 is publicly available except the draft standards and the standards themselves. unless they specifically decide to make those available. as a due for standards after 6 months. Anyway, that presentation caused the liaison back to IATF. which said that, although 8 to 11 is not gonna stick its neck out, say whether this is a good idea or not, they're happy to say that they have no objection. And as we can do it easily because it was designed for other people to be able to develop past selection protocols, and we shouldn't need to get any code points that we can't generate ourselves, but, actually, the rest of the liaison says We do turn out to needs some code points that will be helpful. they'd be happy to consider requests from us for other code points in their protocol. Next slide. So This should be I think it might be encompassed by the that will maintenance item, it can also be added as a separate thing, and So support in the draft in M and A would be a good thing. And, basically, somebody needs to write a draft to sort of start things going. to that Lue burger having not in the queue. trouble getting in the queue. Definitely interesting. the question that comes by in this why here? Why at the why should the IETF be doing a 211 product control plan for protocol."

I mean, we Why not? if you are assuming it's a good thing to be done, I think the the expertise Yeah. It's for that babble is here. The expertise for the control protocol is here, but the expertise for the wireless protocol is there. Well, I don't know. I'm here. I think we've gotten into trouble when we take on other SDOs data plane. and try to do things, and it's it has caused friction in the past. That's why I I don't -- I'm not I I'm I'm not doesn't resonate with me, but that's okay. I'm just one person. I I I will not force you to work on it. Oh, bro. I'll learn it in a future way. I wanna ask the other question. I I just looked at the slides that you presented in 802 Yes. Yes. and several slides say, why should able to be interested in this? But I guess the result was that they were not Well, I didn't why? I mean, why are they not interested in this? And and, yeah, the further question, of course, goes into if we do this, Are people going to implement it and use it, or is I probably, you're gonna say, well, we we don't know anything about this or or what's gonna happen with this. I would think that We would want somebody to be implementing it, even if in, like, sort of an experimental test mode, as part of the development of the specification. determine that it works. There is support for 802.11mesh in in Linux and BSD and stuff. So this place is this gift code in there. normally It has been used before for, like, the one laptop per child and raise other projects."

I I can't, you know I I can't say there's a guarantee implementation, but If we start this effort, there's no guarantee it would complete successfully. like any ever. But I don't know. doing this in 8 or 211 would be a a, you know, require a lot more bureaucratic overhead. I mean, you would have to get a new task group created to do an amendment to the 8 or 211 standard. should have to be approved by the 8 or 12 working group, the landman standards committee, and the IEEE standards board and, you know, dot.dot. I don't know. this is going to take up the remainder of the hour there's no time to do this year recharging discussion anyway, so I let him go for a moment. So I I'll try and be quick. Rick Taylor. So I don't think there's any doubt that Mable works. I don't think there's any doubt that the 80211 s has the relevant hooks to put it in. I don't think there's any doubt that someone could do the work to replace the router ID with MAC addresses, I don't know where the use case is. I don't I I would expect a a radio manufacturer to say, I want to do this. I want to make my product better. And then that's the driving force of making it work. I I feel like this would be okay. Someone in academia might might say this is a great little way to get a PhD, but maybe isn't valid for BHD. This is This is a a thought exercise. because I don't see any pressing industrial need for it. it I don't well, I I I'm not -- My belief would be that that"

I I'm not saying this is a idea. just it feels a a little bit the thought exercise. Well okay. let's let's just comment. So leaves us with 4 minutes for re chartering discussion.

There was one thing that came up actually, in the RTG working group this morning. the the At least From my initial look at it, seems like it could fall under work that a could fit into manet, but also might be very interesting work.

But I just wanted to warn you that you should get approached by the RTG WG chairs on this That's excellent. Thank you. We briefly mentioned this in this session that IETF 113 in Vienna. And Yeah. I thought they had gone away and found a different home, but Yeah. They're very welcome to come back. I'm already done a feature. Right? I was actually gonna say something else, but these are different satellite people. So it's but what we're seeing is a bunch of, you know, satellite interests part of the things that, of course, Meneva's known of the protocols. And maybe the protocols that would be used in a satellite are not the M and A protocols. But These are things that are moving. and that are forming ad hoc networks, and maybe there's some experience here to do some of the frameworking. at least to say -- Right. hey. This that doesn't work or whatever. Now what I really wanted to say is that We've been trying to reach Charter for the last I I don't know. How long? We should I wanna propose that we set up a interim meeting should go to the list. We set up an interim meeting for, I don't know, 6 weeks from now. this Tuesday, whatever the date is, at 2 PM UTC. and that's it.
