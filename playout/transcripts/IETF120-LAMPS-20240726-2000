It is a reminder of the things that we agree to follow as participants in the IETF covers behavior and the standards process and anti-herit and copyright issues and patents issues. Please do not contribute if you're not familiar with this next slide. Please live the IETF Code of Conduct Do not harass each other, treat each other with respect and basically it's okay to attack a biota idea, but don't attack the person delivering it Next slide Please join the Medico. It makes the blue sheets and tells us who's here. It also is the way that we will manage the queue for speaking at the mic, which makes sure that the people in the room and the people remote have equal access to the mic If you're a remote participant, please mute your audio and your video unless you're at the mic line or at the front of the mic line and a headset actually makes the experience far better.

I don't know if there was next updates I don't know if maybe you just want to fast forward to that kind of end slide. So I kind of went through the editorial changes outstanding issues talked about the success at Hackathon We have four implementations I would like to see if people had some comments on next direction other than you know obviously we're going to do the changes that in the previous slide that I talked about anything else that we should be looking at? I guess one thing I can point out the question that came up about using like the RSA 497 talking with some people today and one of the things that could mitigate the issue is just not to lock down on the size of the RSI modulus just like what is done you know with the regular RSA signatures today. If we did that, then people could decide if they want to use RSA 496 or you know, 15-360 or whatever crazy size they want to use. You could figure that out just by the size of the modules, right? So that wouldn't be RSA 4096 or 15-360 or whatever crazy size they want to use. You could figure that out just by the size of the modules, right? So it wouldn't have to be specified if we did that then that might solve us having to make new oids for all these various sizes"

Yeah, I would be shocked if there was no discussion on composites for the first time in history um history So there was good discussion, in addition to what John said, there was all good discussion on list largely led by Peter and Sophie about cutting suggestions for cutting down the size of the list remove the ML Chem 512s, maybe remove one of the RSA strengths I don't know if any of that wants to be said out loud I mean, we're open to cutting down the list, right? Yeah I don't think how many... Some of those people are in the room but not coming to the mic. Oh, there we go So we're talking about six here, not chems, right? So it would be definitely MLDSA2 would be the lowest can candidate to chop right yes i'm sophie I need to figure out where the hand-wresting is My main argument for like, cutting down the size of the list, and I think Scott also wrote an email and agreement, is that we actually try to accomplish different things with the different parts of the hybrid and that gives us the opportunity of like actually doing exactly that and not having like every single combination that that we want but like using each side of the hybrids to accomplish a specific goal For the classic side, this is mostly"

From a security perspective, that means that X-25-19 or anything, else has this accomplishes this since, yeah, you're going to break RSA 2048 at the same time that you break RSA 4096 and everything else with a quantum computer so from a security perspective we really do not care what goes in the classical type from a compliance perspective or from an implementation existing perspective of the a bit different, but yeah, from a security perspective, we don't care there. On the PQ side, on the other hand, the thing that we're trying to defend against with a hybrid is like weaknesses in implementation potential new attacks, and so on. So I do think that it makes some amount of sense to be like taking the somewhat wrong conservative MLM-768 For signatures, I'm a lot less decided whether MLDSA 44 or 56, 65 is a better choice but it's also less urgent there So my approach to cutting down the list is like looking at each site separately and then taking only the combination where it actually accomplish a coherent goal that someone has asked for, which means that basically the classic side is only constrained by compliance and the PQ side, I wish that we can all use just one size of America constrained by compliance and the PQ side I wish that we can all use just one size of MLM but that is a different different discussion, unfortunately It's not going to happen.

We would like people to use level 5 security everywhere and if somehow a user thinks that he or she doesn't need that level five and wants better performance then they can go to level three And then if they think that they don't need level three security and they want better performance then they go to level one And also at the same time, that's why we will like to have level one and three and five available to users But does that mean we want people to use level one? But we want them to be, we hope them to be available for the users. It could be some cases that people go for level one. But again, we recommend it level five first and then number three and level one Okay, so we have level one, three, and five for MOVSA. So I guess the question is, what is the classic algorithms that care with them? right so that Tim could you go back a few slides we do have the list in this deck. Yeah, go to the list of the 13 of them For the M&SA, we don't have level one, we have level two. Oh, yeah, sorry So the only ML cam is we have level one, three, and five yes um and uh level one, we have level two. Oh yeah, sorry. So the only ML cam is we have level one, three, and five. Yes. And for the ML cam, I think that what we talked about as well, even though it's not in this draft Right now, I'm really recommended go with two curves, which are widely used or maybe widely available then the curve P521 so that's why we specify 256 and 385 There is no 521 in this list, you'll notice"

One other thing to worth mentioning is we've had a request from a real implementer who I unfortunately can't name publicly yet, even though asking a lot to have an RSA 49 combination because their policy required 4096 and they can't backtrack their policy on the classical side. So there's a question to the working group, do we add to to 4096s PSS and PCS1? or do we just replace the 372s? Or the other option, which I mentioned earlier is we don't specify the RSA modulus size Or we go back. And then that would actually solve that problem and reduce the number of OAG needed. But I think we've had support rate by a number of people for leaving the modular size fixed I vote in that camp also yeah um i'm actually i actually was actually the one that I wanted to talk about because that's actually that's a point that I'm still kind of thinking about and so I would be I'm still sort of scratching my head a little bit one of the things I am worried about on that one is if we do go in the direction of just having the RSA modulus I'm a little bit worried from a complexity point of view that it's easy to do when there's one key, but now that there's two keys and for a composite where we don't have a boundary between them, and so looking inside the key for the side, is a little bit more challenging for composite than it is for just for a signal signal but it's probably feasible"

I really like what Sophie was saying about keeping an eye on what we're using these for. And in particular, remember the previous discussion, we would consider dropping RSA entirely if it wasn't for the fact that there are some people who have deployed infrastructure that can do RSA, but not ECC and forcing them to change just so that their fallback is ECC instead of RSA seems a little bit of a bridge too far so even the use of RSA is sort of a backup for backwards compatibility people anyway. So us being extremely strict about the size of your backwards compatible RSA key, that strikes me as security engineers maybe causing problems instead of fixing them Plus one Go ahead, Scott. Can I also add one more comment? on top of John? I'm not, I'm not, I'm not dropping the modular size actually saves anything you still need oids for PSS versus P1 and you still need oids for RSA with MLDSA 44 and RSA with MLTSA 65 so I'm not sure you actually save anything by doing it. You do it, but you only need to say it instead of possibly 10 or 12 or whatever player of RSI someone might decide they need I'm just saying that's an option. I'm going to go over some discussion on that. We don't have to do that, right? They both will work.

It's not that we don't require level five, which is recommendable to use the most secure option first and even in the draft tips right now if you look into the the draft trips or three you would find that language at the almost at the end of the FIPS when we say, you know use level 5 and we kind of like making the level 3 as the 4 because it's the best balance between I think it's the good, good tradeoff for performance and security but that language was not super perfect but what we meant was that use level five and then if you want better performance you go to level three And if not, you're level to level 1 If you're okay with level 1 and get more performance The same with AS. We're okay with AS 128 but we preferable to use AES to over AS128 AS-128 Okay, I would make the observation that for certificates ML Chem 70s, the level 5 is considerably more expensive and so, quite frankly, I don't know if it's actually just, the expense is justified in that case. Thank you Sophie? Yes, I wanted to mostly say mayor opinion on the rs a key size bit uh which I think is something that Scott and I differ in opinion mostly just because of the symmetry, making it pretty I prefer the RSA key size in there because everything else has its key size as well Uh, from a more like security and not, uh, beauty point of view the idea is that you should"

It's not the same algorithm if the modulus size is different Of course, with RSA, that is like actually somewhat of a debate that you can have. I don't have strong feelings about this. I think it makes sense to have the modular size in there, but it's not the worst thing to get rid of it. And I think the brainproof curves we can just get rid of it sounds like. Well, we would if people don't need them, we will get rid of them but we have heard from European places that they like brainpool curve. So if we can, I guess, get confirmation that that's not the case, then yes, we can remove them I guess the other thing to think about is I know, like, the open PGP group is also doing composites right, and probably aligning with them in some ways makes sense. And I know they, I think they have brain pool curves as well So that's something you think about too So I will make one observation, and that is when we just use RSA signature as today we have Oids for RSA with hash X and it says nothing about the modulus size, which has led to things like RSA 4096 with shop 1 and having an impedance match there makes a lot of sense to me Okay. Yeah So it sounds like we're leaning towards the direction of the lead signing new oids for the RSA 4096-1 then And the brain pool ones, I guess, we need to talk to people and see if we actually need them or maybe there's only one or something that we can get down to so on the brain pool ones I guess we need to talk to people and see if we actually need them or maybe there's only one or something that we can get down to so does that seem to be what people are coming to agree on?"

I feel like I'm talking too much here but how bad is the misbinding thing? Like the backstory here is that Cass Kramas came up with some definitions and left it as an open question of what ML Chem actually fulfills I then found like by looking at the definition, I think reasons of why ML Chem is not fulfilling these very strong mel by looking at the definition, I found reasons of why ML Chem is not fulfilling these very strong melbind KCT or Melbind KP properties That being said, the attack model here is extreme strong. It assumes that the attacker has full control over the private key And this is full control over the private key, they can create a situation well, I'm like if we have the time then I can talk about this for quite some time, unfortunately unfortunately this is this is full control they can create a situation where two parties will agree on the shared secret that they will not agree on either the ciphertext or the public key That is most of the time probably not an issue. My main reason for that is that if we look at ECI, in the way that it's usually deployed in HPEC and similar, we have not just mal misbinding, but what in CASA's paper is called on misbinding so honest parties by just off sort of very similar note of like I do something that is"

I don't know. It's hard to say There are sometimes situations where the idea that the attacker has control over the private key doesn't sound as ridiculous as it might on first glance. One example that I can share is a situation that we had where we did a static, static, ECDH key exchange, which provides authentication, but it has this property called KCI, key compromise impersonation where if I know your private key i can it has this property called KCI, Key Compromise Impersonation, where if I know your private key, I cannot only impersonate you, but I can impersonate the other side to you as well Not a big deal. Who cares? Lots of protocols have KCI as a property, so no problem, ship it. At the same time, some other security team have the problem that they needed a one-site authenticated version of this protocol. And so they did something that sounds very reasonable of, well, if I have a patent, and I share this password with all participants then I'm no longer authenticated. So instead of doing a self-signed certificate, which requires extra code, they just made a credential that was shared among multiple parties which means that that"

In this case it would still not be malbind that would be a problem, but it would be in Cassus papers terms leak bind where the attacker has access to the private key but is not able to manipulate it But you could imagine something where like this shared credential is like, i don't know stored in in a uh network share or something just so that everybody has access to it where the attacker also has right access to the credential where you would then get this situation where the attacker actually has right like has this access to the private key and we're not already completely screwed So this is like the long motivation of why sometimes it actually matters even when the attacker has access to the private key as a precondition for this attack The problem now is that KCI is not the same as misbinding, so even in this hypothetical scenario, I'm not aware of any scenario where the misbinding actually would hurt the protocol. So far, I have not seen any protocol that has been constructed where this malicious misbinding is actually a problem. Cass is someone optimistic that there might be such a protocol at least hypothetically I think that such a protocol basically needs to be constructed in order to be vulnerable which probably means it's not a big deal.

They all go away if you don't serialize the private key It's kind of weird edge case but I don't know. I can't really tell you what it means Okay, informative, but does answer the question So Daniel, regarding your point, later on the slide, regarding private keys and stored as seed, I think we should focus on transmitted like in a PKCS8 There I think it makes sense to require the private key be transmitted as a seed. But what form they store it in and thus implement I don't think is our business Fair enough. So that would be an update to this draft or maybe the Khyber search draft, or maybe both We'd have to wait, I suppose, for the NIST publication anyways. Well, right.

So here's the currently proposed combiner although I'm literally about to change it like today. But let's go through what's in the current Oph Next slide So the first change is the KDF is now Shaw 3 of the appropriate Shaw 3 size. It is no longer KMac that aligns with X-wing and it align with Open PGP. Next The counter is the super stupid fixed value, although as per mail list discussions, Quinn pointed out, Yoshi-D actually don't need it. There's a follow up. I don't know if it's a implementation guidance document or something, but there's a follow-up document not 56C itself by different document that actually allows you to omit this when it is constant and there's only a single iteration. So we'll definitely look at taking this out because it is dumb dumb um we did a little switch here where we put the traditional shared secret first which is bizarre because everywhere else in the document the ML Chem component comes first. This was we did this because we believed on sort of a naive reading of 56 CR2, it looks like the construction Z prime equals Z KKat It looks like Z is the thing that you have to get your FIPP's compliance from, but in fact, Quinn pointed out there's a sentence buried way lower down that says actually it can be either component that's phipps certified so we thought we had to put the thing that we know is FIP certified first in order to be compliant but turns out that's not true it can be I be the shared secrets both of them have to come first before all the other crap But we thought the order of the shared secrets matters turns out it doesn't. So I'll reverse this change and keep the ML Chem SS first in the trap SS"

So it does have to be shared secrets first and then all the other crap at the end so that you can count them as fixed info as per 56 CR2 So this change sticks Next, once Russ is done staring at it and then finally inclusion of the trad ciphertext and the trad public key that's calling it trad yorks be RSA could be RSA or heliptic curve, we are not including the ML Chem CT or the ML Chem public key so that goes to Dan's slide like three minutes ago It is my understanding is it's believed that I'm Chem doesn't need to bind the CT and the public key externally it already does it sufficiently well internally So this construction aligns with X-wing, and I think it aligns with open PGP Next that says exactly what I just said Oh, actually, sorry, hold on There's an extra sentence, go back, go back, go back. So the action paper proves that this is sufficient to achieve the desired biting properties when tried as a neat ECDH variant. Early reviews by Douglas Tabilla deirdre connolly suggests that this should also hold for rsa oaap but a proof is needed A proof is I think beyond my personal skill set. So how we get a proof if we can put a carrot on a stick to get someone to help us with that I think that is a totally reasonable request, though A carrot on a stick Yeah.

Go ahead, Daniel So as an implementer, it's not of crypto, but of this, which is slightly above the crypto it seems like a bad thing because now you have to just consider many more options and this actually kind of leads to a something else that is somewhat related, which is the various ASM1 encoded of the public key and the project key, not the ciphertext and this applies to signatures as well This is all very peak-hicks and implementations might not want to be doing all this ASM-1 stuff if they want more of a general implementation We don't want, you know, one implementation doesn't want to implement ML Chem 768 plus Shaw to 250s artists of a general implementation. We don't want, you know, one implementation doesn't want to implement ML Chem 768 plus Shaw-2-250s, sorry, ECDSA, Shaw-256, three times so that they can support conferences signature"

It would be nice to be consistent I think it would be awesome if we had a crypto library at the lower layer that was in common So we could do that. We could do domain separator as the der encoding of the OID for every except the ML Chem I guess 768 x-2519 and that one it's, we use the X-Wing domain separator and then it's spider compatible. That's possible. We have to move the domain separator to the front, I think also, but it can be done So I guess also, sorry, a related question is are we still waiting on CFRG work for finalizing this chem combiner work? Okay, are we? Yeah, I've got to slide to that point later on. Yes. Yes, we are That's a discussion point All of this could change anyways. Correct okay well then i don't have strong comments Back to you, Mike. OK, next slide Yeah, I just, I mean, I think that slide is important in that it is actually a pretty important interrupt point, even though it's fairly minor Okay, the next big change is that we've swapped from RSA Chem to RSA OAAP This was largely due to a comment on List by Sophie that, well, RSA-Kem is really nice and easy to work with, from a design perspective, like zero crypto libraries on the planet implement it. So not very useful for backwards compatibility In fact, exactly zero useful for backwards compatibility um it. So not very useful for backwards compatibility. In fact, exactly zero useful for backwards compatibility. So then the options were PKK1 1 or OAAP and what I suspect PKCS1 encryption is still very common, and the people who have ancient libraries would very much like if lamps gave them"

I think it's straight and it's three lines of code, but it obviously needs review So thanks to that list of people at the bottom of the page within the last two weeks have taken a peek at this and given feedback. So that's awesome Next Yeah, so D Chem, this has gone through various versions. At one point I submitted a draft to LAPs called DH Chem and then I dropped it Yeah, that's it. So that's, and then we decided, you know what, let's, let's not have a separate standalone how to use DH in CM so this is all part of the making these things less generic Over the last couple of years, we've made composites less and less generic so rather than um having a nice modularized DH can we said ask for it let's just inline RFC 918 And so this is a similar version of 9180. It's simplified because 9180's DH cam in caps binds the public key and binds the cipher text, which we don't need to do because we're going to be doing that anyways at the hybrid level, at the composite level So this is simplified only in that it doesn't use the labeled extract"

Chem, if it's Diffie Hellman turned into a cam, do you have a better name? for it? Does anyone have a monopoly on the phrase DH Chem? DH Chem Plus DHKM star DHKM minus, yeah, exactly DHKM mic mic Okay, fair enough, we can debate naming on the list if we think that's KEMDH Chem-D-H, oh, God. Okay new oids, I'm going to turn off the chat, new oids oids we have broken interop pretty horribly here, but given that we're not actually aware of any implementation like zero people have thus far brought composite chem implementations to the hackathon. We decided to be lazy and not rev theoids Yep, we will definitely start revving the oids going forward I think Carl now has a implementation of the hackathon and OQS is supposed to have one anytime, so we'll definitely start revving oids going forward.

We've now got an appendix that unrolls the component SPC know if John mentioned this in his presentation. We did this in both Kems and SIGs. We've now got an appendix that unrolls the component SPKIs. So if you need to reconstruct the SPKIs, like if you have to hand the public key down to your Olympic curve side and your ML Chem side of your library separately you need a full, fully reconstructed elliptic curve SPKI, we decided to have an appendix where we actually give you the full, like fully laid out, possibly even dare encoded SPKI so there's no ambiguity about which parameters to choose or what SPKI, we decided to have an appendix where we actually give you the full, like fully laid out, possibly even DER encoded SPKI, so there's no ambiguity about which parameters to choose or whatever. Next Next yeah, chem combiners. So this is Dan, sort of brought this up all right Are we waiting for this or not? Is the open question for the working group? CFRG has recommended, or the design team has recommended that CFRG start with three combinations So I mean, I guess that in theory three of the things on our list of 10 could over with CFRG. The other seven will not Should we wait for this and then make them binary compatible or not? My vote is not Let's just go ahead with this and we'll do this if we need to no one seems to be screaming so take that to the list, permit. Okay i'm gonna yeah i'll turn these slides into a big old email there's a lot of open questions.

The open question here that I haven't heard any discussion of, and I'd love if any in the room has connections to like smart card vendors, or like super embedded lightweight devicey things is it a fair assumption that like a smart card that's decrypting for you like maybe can connected to s mime does that smart card have actually to its public key when it's doing a decryption If we make it mandatory to bind the elipidia, curve public key, are we going to run into implementation? that say, actually, I don't have access to the public key at decryption? time? And I'd love to know one way or another from the kinds of vendors where this matters if that matters I am not a smart card vendor. I am a big rack at HSM vendor Mike's going to the mic Not of it Mike scott johnson, not a vendor, but it, it, it basically just depends upon the applet rather than the smart card. Most of the smart cards tend to, if they're generating stuff on the card, they will keep the public key with it Obviously, if you've got an elliptic curve, you can recover the public key. Same thing with an RSA key. So you just need the public modulus from it's sort of this is sort of along the same point Tim made a few minutes ago of if we make this over prescriptive then we would be harming backwards compatibility which is in fact the primary goal here.

And the KDF generates more than the output of the SHA-3 function below us, then you need the output output of the shard-3 function below us, then you might, then you need the output lens for your kDF, and then it's more than that, then you need to have a counter in order to run twice, to make, you know, twice or three times or something like that, to make more output lens for your KDF.
