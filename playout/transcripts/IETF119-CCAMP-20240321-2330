In, with respect to the 3R. So we need to align the 3R modeling with optical impairment. And also, another point is this model will intend to be used for, support a tunnel provisioning for both integrated the transponder, which is more quote, unquote, traditional and also, the remote to transponders, for example, coderant pluggables, So, hopefully, the same model can be applied to cover both use cases.

I have a comment regarding what said before, by Daniele regarding the impact of the model So my view is that, we have a good amount of the of work and the layer 0. Model that is optical impairments, there is WDN tunnel. And, a 1993 biz that is the base, for both with common structure and the interface model that has to be align with, the new structure. So in my view, what the, the process is that, is the pluggable that has to use what is already done in, in in the c camp layer 0.

So the follow-up question is that the the network element notion here ordered be the same definition as an IV where it's a collection of functions versus Yes. More Absolutely. Yes, sir. Take a Thanks. So just just to emphasize that, we're we're intending to use the models as their find and as they evolve, we have to evolve the descriptions here. So same applies to the click the, development network topology. So, chosen a pictorial form to start with, to try and the to grips with the the actual layering and so on. So it's showing a Ch3 45, pictorial View where we've got representations of the link, the brown lines, the, determination point. They're the purple things and the nose, the yellow things. And, I've chosen a a technique here, which we've been using in Tapi, which been quite beneficial to to help us represent the networks. Reason I've chosen a pictorial view initially is that it helps get an understanding of the valeri in general, and if you're familiar with some of the TAPI documentation, you'll find there are some very complex network pictures in that don't fancy writing all the JSON for. So, the the idea here is we'd have, maybe some modules of Jason, which would represent"

So it's just saying this is how you use them. Again, in the tappy world, we found that to be extremely beneficial because it's, it removes a lot of unnecessary variety in the way people represent things. So gives us a lot more consistency, in the way we see things being represented in the network in general. So, the next steps, get out for the activities. We've we have weekly meetings that we have the times on this here, but we have weekly, well, weekly or biweekly meetings, biweekly. Thank you. Biweekly, they seem like that week. Let's what happens here. This is there for me so often again. see Yes. That's right. So, in the, the, imagery model work, if I was mentioned, on the layering model, I've got a do quite a lot more work on alignment with the terminology, getting the other models into play, and looking at terminology across the which led us to an idea that we might wanna try and also explain relationships between our model work here and model work and other activities so we can actually, help people understand what we're doing and, take it on board. So, was we also, my point about Jason being extensive in some of the network situations. So looking at the potential tooling to help us generate the JSON so it's not all done from, from scratch by hand. And also, in general, starting to publish the JSON, and we're looking to not produce a big model the, the final slide here says goes back to what Hilla was saying about the existing work. One of the challenges with the existing work is it's huge, huge, so it's difficult to penetrate and difficult to maintain and so on.

We don't need to fight with anyone sharing the infrastructure. In the second case scenario number b is where the the fiber is shared, but only in a point point fashion, so there is no mesh in between And typically, there will be from central office to central office, aggregating several traffic from several routers to to the other, day, so we need to fight only between ourselves.

One side on the left hand side, which is connected to the holes is electrical side, the characteristic of those attributes which on the left hand side most likely, hosts or routers should be aware of majority of the or at least a subset of them. This is something that both should agree on those. On the right hand side, how all the there are some characteristics from optical and photonic. And in most cases, Hostor router should not be you know, concern about those. Again, I did say majority in most cases, we find out, you know, 100% the case, but we wanna just keep that one in mind that if there are some of those attributes that host should be able we will consider that one as well.

Having this one in mind, we run a night, item number 2 here says that we are going to focus on the various areas. And these various areas is also explained here that we are talking about the from the modeling person, the capabilities are the read only hardware or software characteristic that a specific harder, pluggable transport.

Another one that we are investigating, is related to the state and the threshold that we want to consider for example, if I want to have a generic approach for a state to have some threshold, we have to figure something.

Another worst maybe all of them are majority of them, have the characteristic of the minimum, maximum average, instantaneous value, and so forth.

Mechanism to have a threshold, a generic approach to find out the how we can put a thumb threshold watermark for the minimum ones, so forth for a attribute. And last but not least, we have to also consider that proprietary property that an attribute which exists like it or not, this is something that will be, and what's the best way to address So with that, I think we are open, for question, if there are any Risha, before going to the questions, one quick comment, or the Google Sheet and all these kind of external tools probably will be convenient to to put in the Wiki, someone named me to reference in the the Google Sheet and probably how to access that and and so Yeah. Feel free Sure. Sure. Definitely. to take all the time 1. I will speak and run, Oh, what's my Oh, thank you.
