    "text": "explained through this example and the basic idea here was that if I here prefix p1 on my mas 4 on top I\u0027m the network operator of a s4 I on this int on the interface on the Left towards a s - I have prefix p1 is what I get in a route and I don\u0027t get p2 on that interface so if I if I apply feasible path you RPF it\u0027s the data from a s1 which has prefixes p1 p2 p3 the data can come with source address in in p2 or p3 and I might be dropping those packets and don\u0027t want to happen that to happen so what is done here is that I look at look into my rib and I figured it out that this originating a s that I see in this announcement on the left side p1 with origin ASAS 1 I look into the ribbond and I figure out that with originating from that ASI also have p2 and p3 routes for which I have heard on other interface not the same interface on the left so now I realized my construction of the reverse path filter table and I include p2 and p3 in in the table on that interface on the left so I make it more generalized more flexible and I do the same for all interface and and this works for first for certain scenarios next slide and it was pointed out in the in the working group the discussion list as well as in the meeting that there are scenarios like this which are challenging even with that improvement on the feasible path and what is challenging here is that on the left side now s1 uses no export and as a result a s2 does not propagate p1 and p2 to a s4 so in the in the proposal s4 dependent on depended on a case 1 prefix p1 or p2 to make it on that interface have it out announced on that interface but that\u0027s not happening now so that\u0027s the challenge in this case that method doesn\u0027t work but we have an enhancement which is explained on the next slide please so the the algorithm now is that you you consider the list of interfaces that you have towards customers that is the set I and you look at all the routes that you are receiving on those interfaces and from from those routes you pick all the unique prefixes that that you have heard and and also from those routes you make a list of the a SS that are origin a SS in those routes and and so now you have so you have that and then you make also a list of prefixes which you have heard "
