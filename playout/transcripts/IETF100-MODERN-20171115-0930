FCC is still interested in future of numbering and number administration issues modern is still the only workgroup that\u0027s that is working on global standards for numbering in an IP environment and we\u0027ll learn more in the future oh one more thing I\u0027d add which I found out after putting the slide together they\u0027ve FCC has a Advisory Committee called North American Numbering Council they\u0027ve recreated that just just yesterday or the day before and they\u0027ve added a nationwide number portability "
