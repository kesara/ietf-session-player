We have a couple of Overeux and chair slides to go through Oh, we have someone in the back could shut the door just in case we get extra noise coming in So, welcome to IETF 120 and DTN so that you know, these sessions are recorded and will be posted after the IETF on YouTube We are Thursday, so most people have been here through most of the week so just to note well here We are bound by all of our processes and policies and BCPs Something to add. The I IESG has asked all of our chairs to remind their working groups of the need for appropriate behavior that is described of course because it's the IA asked all of our chairs to remind their working groups of the need for appropriate behavior that is described, of course, because it's the IETF and BCP 54, but the summary is that we do expect people to be respectful and courteous to their colleagues all of the time and that we do want to have impersonal discussions and that we really need to focus on the quality of the technical solutions Again, if you're looking for resources, the agenda is on online for the overall IET"

If you are unfamiliar with Meetecho, here's how it works We do need some who will agree to take primary notes, but we do ask that for the folks that are online and also here in the room, please make sure that you are taking those notes, and I see that Adam had volunteered for that. Thank you, Adam the agenda slide seems to have been formatted incorrectly in the PDF conversion, but we do have a somewhat full agenda, but we're trying to save time at the end for additional discussion. We're going to go through the BPSC COSI security context status We're going to talk a little bit about EID patterns, followed by an update to our network management work and then a presentation of COAP over BP, followed by some updates on bundle and bundle encapsulation and its applicability for custody transfer. And what's at the bottom of the screen, which has just fallen off a bit, is a rechartering discussion around the fact that we are now in a new area the internet area, and we may want to look at our existing charter and whether we want to include some things There's 20 minutes for that, and we have 20 minutes of open mic at the end. So I think that we've really allocated a lot of time for these discussions With that, any changes, updates or requests for changes to the agenda? All right, Rick, anything else? No, I think that's governor.

One key aspect of COSE is that it currently and is expanding support for PKI and PKI-I and P-KI X and even in the near future there's going to be support for compresses seabore compressed certificates as well And so the point here is to make you of this existing COSE mechanism in BPSEC. Next slide, please please So there were a few editorial changes in the last revision of the document We added minimum interoperability for a few different algorithms that were just missing. This doesn't change the behavior but it just restricts at the very least you have to support these specific kind of algorithms and allow single layer encryption for situations where you have a security association already established One change related to ticket number 27 is the only one that has a functional effect on the BPSEC draft, which is what this does is it wraps one of the parameters in a byte string similar to our identical to how another one of the parameters have been wrapped in a byte string"

It's just something that probably should be a consideration for also future BPSEC security context, which is if you have a data structure that's kind of unbound, in size or complexity, it would be a good idea to byte string wrap them so that the abstract security block doesn't inherit that complexity necessarily So again, not a change in overall behavior just to change it one form of the encoding to simplify things Next slide, please so going back to the original goal is that this is not supposed to be superseding anything that's preexisting It's meant to expand the envelope of what can be accommodated in BPSec in standards way And one thing that this document does, touch that is definitely not in scope of the security context is about policies behind any of this stuff. So what this does is it establishes a minimum interoperability set of algorithms, but it doesn't say when it's appropriate to use which algorithm that is an application need. And it's something that would be needed to be negotiated either in-band or out-of-band separate from this So this document has been through a last call but this last change about the byte string mapping is a change in the encoded form for one of the parameters.

Thank you. Definitely signs. And I will mention, since there's a little bit time left, yeah reason for this last change was further implementation experience with this security context.

Well, Brian, presentation one Our next topic is also going to be from Brian talking about EID patterns which I personally am really excited about so I think it's... I'm more excited than you So, yeah, this topic is more speculative more draft than the earlier one If we could go to the next slide to talk a little bit about what is the point of this thing Existing bundle protocol agents, existing tools, existing configuration generations and orchestrations for BPAs and BP networks generally already have some kind of a notion of a way to structure an EID set that's more than just listing out an enumeration of individual EIDs And the point of what's being proposed here, is to standardize a way to do this so that the writer of one of these patterns and the reader and user of the pattern have the same interpretation and you're not expecting a tool to treat things one way and the tool actually treats things a different way So one way generally to do patterns in text is a glob or regular expression The difficulty with especially the IPN scheme of EA EIDs, which is one that exists right now, is that those mechanisms are just tech text-based. They don't take into account any intrinsic properties of the EID"

And also, that the pattern as it's encoded cannot be compressed in ways that currently EIDs have scheme-specific methods for and one aspect of this kind of pattern matching syntax is that there is an overall network effect related to the more that these mechanisms get used, the more useful they become because when you are familiar with configuring one policy on one BPA, or one security application and others use the same mechanism, well, you don't have to reach yourself or you don't have to switch back and forth between sometimes an asterisk means this and sometimes an asterisk means that and I can't remember which one it uses, so I have to cross-check documentation all the time so this also has a benefit of reducing the possibility of misconfiguration and security vulnerability is associated with that So the tool might very well be doing exactly the right thing that it's supposed to be doing but the configuration is not what the operator expected it to behave as And one last thing is that this, proposal is compatible with the IPN schema update, and I'll talk about that shortly So next slide, please The specific use cases here are that are spelled out currently and this is not a exhaustive list but for secure processing, this allows security identities to be encoded in places like P-KIC certificates where a key holder is authorized not just to operate on a single endpoint, but on a variety of endpoints.

The next thing is about routing, forwarding and authorization. The point of this is to do something similar to how IP sitter classes that remain routing notating works. The point here is not to say that we're using this for routing but to say that sitter notation now is used widely across many different tools that have nothing to do with IP routing, but have to do with access control configurations or detail like that where I just want to encode a block of IPs without listing out 8,000 different entries and then configuration of an actual BPA where we want to talk about we have allowed listing or block listing or saying things like an example here a certain specific EID is allowed to sign act as a security source and sign bundles for any source from my organizational authority. So this would be for things like security gateways or for policies related to especially crime cross-organizational behavior like that.

The last update is to address the third point on this slide, which is the end scheme-specific part type of pattern And this is actually something that's going to be important that hasn't really been discussed elsewhere related to be BPAs that act as interior route within a larger network that a router can do its job without necessarily understanding all possible schemes that will ever be in invented and used and a router and interior router especially, that's acting on a trunk really needs to be able to operate in a way that it's not going to throw traffic away because I don't necessarily understand the exact contents of a report to EID That field doesn't and shouldn't affect your ability to route traffic If your destination and your source are in schemes, that you understand, but your report to is not, well, that means you can't send status reports, but you can still route the traffic. And that is a better outcome than if you simply drop the traffic as an interior router, which seems like a bad thing to have happened So there's the any scheme pattern, which means it's a catch-all but then there's the any SS meaning for a specific scheme I don't care what's in the scheme-specific part. I don't even care that I can decode it or not, but when you see scheme number two, you treat it a certain way and treating a certain"

I'm not going to go through the D details right here because there's examples later on but they are both tailored to the scheme-specific parts. So IPN scheme SSP is composed of numbers So the patterns for IPN schemes are dealing with things at the level of number ranges and number match And one, important part of one of the open issues currently is that there are some unknown about the DTN scheme pattern matching and there's been a suggestion to, and I think it's a good suggestion to defer the DTN scheme patterns out of the main doc document because the main document is not more than just saying here's the IPN scheme and here's the any scheme or any SS It also registers entries in IANA registries and it's important to be able to have those in place even before necessarily all of the possible schemes have been worked out. But the IPN scheme pattern because it is based on integers and it's well well-understood semantics, those can be done right now. But just as an eye for the future there is still one thing that is not stated in this document and should not be stated and maybe needs to be more explicit, which is that any scheme specific pattern should not need to and does not need to have that kind of set logic that you could do with an IPN scheme but really probably cannot do with a text text-based DTN scheme, which is to say, pattern A is a strict subset of pattern B, or these two patterns have overlap or things like that"

It enables you to catch problems quicker if you can do them, like in the IPN scheme But there shouldn't be an assumption by users as this thing that you can do that kind of set logic. So next slide please The last change of the document itself was at a add a goal section to more clearly lay out what is the point of this thing. It added the any scheme pattern, or it modified the end scheme pattern to be consistent with the others and added the any sSP pattern to allow this to be general purpose. So even in the absence, of a scheme specific, a DTN scheme specific syntax, you can still match the D purpose. So even in the absence of a scheme specific, a DTN scheme specific syntax, you can still match the DTN scheme for the NESP pattern. So you can still handle that in the general case And then the last thing is this added a registration with the IANA PIC's name constraints extend And the point of this is to enable some really nice security behavior in a distributed network that's already part of how PICS operates We're not inventing any new mechanisms, but we're taking advantage of the way that P-KX is currently designed, which originated in the era of sub-net that were had were, had poor connectivity between them, that had intermittent connectivity, that had networks splits and disconnects all the time and so P kicks and that kind of aspect, generally is made to operate and doesn't really need logical modifications to handle distributed DTNs where you have"

And that is a perfect can candidate for this kind of thing, because it just narrows down what is what is going to have the widest support, and if you do it if you restrict yourself to this then you're going to operate in a lot more environments than choosing one or the other there's another recommendation about disallowing empty regular expressions and that's a reason thing. And there's even one thing that I don't think is written up as an explicit issue, and I don't know if it's actually covered by the current text ABNF is, an empty pattern itself should probably be disallowed because it doesn't really make sense to have an empty pattern because there is the catch-all pattern pattern And then the topic that we were on before about the DTN scheme separating out into a separate draft is probably worthwhile. I think that's the end if you go to the next slide I'll skip over the examples for now. We can come back to them but if you go to the next slide then It isn't important to understand that an EID pattern is not an EID They need to be treated differently. They can't coexist you can't see a piece of text or a seabor and know which one you're looking at, this is something that already exists in the land of Pekis, and it's already well understood understood And these patterns can be complex in practice So the point of having a common definition"

So the way it works right now is the IPN scheme pattern always has three elements but that doesn't mean that it has to there's right now there's no relation between the pattern and the EID in terms of the number of components in that it uses the logic of the IPN update but it doesn't care about did the original EID start out as two components or three components There's no, there's no restriction there"

I understand we don't have cider as an option for some of the space.

So it is a nice structure among all these documents So going into the details of some of the recent changes starting with AMM ADM documents. So the ADM YANG encoding has become completely separated from the AMM document so the model is separate from the encoding And the AMM document, we have done some stuff to clear the built-in terminology and things to help with implementation such as the explicit listing of semantic types and also specific categories for controls and operators and adding specific procedures for type matching and coverage with built-in and semantic types. We also added a notion of display hint annotations and these are specifically met for user interfaces.

In the base ADMs that we have exam of, including the agent ADM, we've added the display hint identity hierarchy, so this goes back to the AMM document where we talk about the notion of display hint annotation. This is what we're using in the ADM module itself and we also added a table filter in the agent ADM to filter and reduce table sizes In the ARI document, there's been several changes, as you can see, some notable ones include for just to help with ARI text processing, we are now using the UI authority segment for the namespace so just following the double slash. So it's really clear what is the namespace and what is not And then we also added the ability to reference just a namespace and instead of having implied built-in types we just have now literals that are untyped, so that is simpler We also remove the base 32 representation of a byte string, so now it's just base 16 and base 64 and also to prevent unnecessary percent encoding we have a specific character set of base 64 URL for byte string And just for implementation guidance, we also have an appendix and added more encoded examples as well. For the AMP document, the again, has been revived. So after a long dispiry time, we have actually, brought it back.

Right now, it's included in the BASA ADM for the AMM module And the question is whether we should put that completely separately in a different ADM or not Regarding hierarchy and namespaces right now for it is just a flat namespace, so the question is whether we should make it a two-level namespace, just like the EID updates So for example with the organization if the module name is IETFD TMA agent the enumeration would be the instead of just being one number, it'd be the organization number and then the 80 the module name is IETF detain agent, the enumeration would be the, instead of just being one number, it'd be the organization number, and then the ADM number. So IETF would be organization number one, and then for their first ADM, it could be at the, DTMA AGM, it could be 1.1 This could be very helpful but then there's a larger question regarding ODM specifically the operation data models whether these will also need a too two-level hierarchy, whether we could put it under all wonder parrot for all ODMs like organization zero or something like that.

So, you know our runtime store is allowed to contain AI references, or should they be resolved before entering runtime? Yeah, and those cover all our over issues To speak on implementation experience, which, you know, we've done the implementation of the preview versions of documents and now we're working on in implementing the updates to these documents So aspects of these new changes have been prototyped with the AMS ACE, which is a Python library covering specific ADM and AI processing and the DTMA tool which is a library in C with the D-TMA agent.

Yeah, I think so. Off top of my head sorry. What I also noticed that Brian C-post joined the Q Okay. So Brian, is that a question or a response to Rick? More of a general statement about ODMs and just greasing that topic, just to say that if there is only one ODN, namespace, then there's the increased possibility for collisions and so having having multiples of them means that things that start out separately and later become overlapping in terms of operations would hopefully avoid collisions easier. Yeah, I that was my thinking as well, Brian. It's just I think the world's experience with anything which uses mod Brian it's just I think that the world's experience with anything which uses modules is as soon as you've got modules you end up with a lot of modules and having a mechanism to de-conflict and manage them is worth a little bit of effort.

So this is an example of technology we're working on within this working group that is not bundle protocol specific so if even if you have no interest in bundle projects but you are interested in things which are working in this environment, this is still relevant And actually, to add more to that with Chair Head Off, with with this is done is take a standard autonomy model that is quite popular in flight software systems for deep space and and say this is how fault management and operational autonomy is typically done in flight software. How might that be experienced? using network management? sensibilities and yang modules and tooling? and so on? And it is the merge of those two things Yeah, and going back to the AMP document the asynchronous messaging protocol, again, even though in the current document we have the bundle binding we have discussed and really anticipate future documents to come out with other different bindings So yeah.

My co-author is Anna Calvera We are both from UPC. Next please So first of all, a reminder on what is co-op and what is co-op intended for So Co-op is an application layer protocol which has been designed for IoT environments. These are characterized by significant resource constraints such as low energy availability which often leads to intermittent connectivity because radio interfaces need to be duty-cycle Also, high delays, low bandwidth, high error rates among others so co-op is a web protocol. It is based on the rest architecture, rest principles also used in HTTP. However, co-op is optimized to provide light-width operation. For instance, the message Heather without options has a size of only four bytes. And it also includes a little bit of transparently a functionality, especially when running on top of UDP or other unreliable protocols And nevertheless, it provides also a lot of flexibility and asynchronous message exchange Next please so the main goal in this draft is specifying how co-op can be carried over BP the intended status of the draft is standard track and today I'm presenting version 01, which aims to address the feedback that was received from both the core working group which specifies co-op and its ecosystem and also the DTN working group you can see the list of acknowledgments is really long and we are really thankful for all the good feedback that we have received from everyone.

And it seems like we have a way forward to enable that based on RFC a 3 to 3.3 which specifies how co-up is carried over reliable transports. So what's relevant there is that there's a message format for co-op which includes the length of the message, and then probably in the next update of the draft, here we can specify that we can concatenate several co-op messages by using that format and include that as the payload of"

We have added that most of the co-parameters and related times are relevant for con messages However, the protocols below BP may support reliability and congestion control, and in that case, using non-messages might suffice to achieve a reason degree of reliability and congestion control and therefore simplifying the configuration of the protocol. So, still, if we use non-messages, there are some congestion control considerations for non-message transmission that still would apply. They are specified in the base co-up specification, which can be summarized as, first of all, in start, which is the number of outstanding interactions is one by default and it can be changed but it requires RTT measurements. Another one is the in absence of advanced could congestion control, a COP endpoint that's sending non-messages to some destination which the not provide responses to be safe then you should not exceed probing rate, which is one bite per second, but that's kind of safety measure in this extreme case in which you have zero feedback. And on the other hand, send a main transport multiple copies of a non-message for a number of risks Long is in the queue Yes, thank you for this presentation I was wondering if you think of about using the non-response option to avoid to get feedback when it's not necessary Yeah, that's something that we've already thought about.

Thank you. Yeah next please So we also have a section on Observe Recall that observe is the mechanism by which co-op clients which may be interested in some resource handled by a server. When Observe, recall that Observe is the mechanism by which co-op clients which may be interested in some resource handled by a server whenever the, well, the clients register their interest in that resource, and then whenever there's an update, in the state of that resource, the client will just send notifications with a representation of the updated state of the resource So in some applications it may be relevant to determine which is the last notification that has been sent So which notification was the last one sent by the server or if we received two notifications, which one was the last? we state in this draft that when using COP over BP, it should be decided based on the creation timestamps of the encapsulating bundles We also explained that, well, if for whatever reason, the timestamp information is not available at the application layer, then the time between the receipts times of the two notifications may be used in instead. Here, well, by default, if the difference between two notifications is greater than 128 seconds, the last one received is considered to be also the last two cent. That's by default That's because 128 seconds is greater than the max latency default max latency in co-up, which is 100 seconds However, of course, in many of the scenarios where BP may be used, these max latency is not enough, there will be a greater"

Given your running over bundle protocol and creation timestamps exist in the encapsulating bundle, do you think your perhaps trying to optimize for a very rare case? here where you're saying, oh, the implementation doesn't propagate that creation, that time? stamp up, and so the handling application now has to invent things but only when the later yeah be easier just to say an implementation must push this timestamp up because it solves this issue and save you a thousand words? I agree Thank you Next please. Okay then you may recall that in the first version of the draft, we attempted to create a new Europe scheme, something called CoAP Plus BP However, we received feedback that perhaps it would be better to just stick to co-op as the URI scheme and actually there are some recommendations there in a core working group draft, which is the transport indication document and on the hand the co-op scheme is defined from the base co-op specification and for the authority component of the uri we request the creation of two new reserve domains in the .arpa namespace. This is actually followed the guidance of this transport indication draft So it would be the domain would be DTN dot ARPA for and endpoint IDs based on the DTN scheme or IPM ARPA for those based on the IPN scheme"

So, yeah, we'll apply this change in the next update. So it would be 2.81.ipn.arpa And we have left to-do in the draft to request a well-known service number for co-ab since this is already well the will be a registry created after the DTNIPN update draft for the IPN URL scheme, the registry for the well-known service numbers for BP 7. Next please Also, we have added the section on securing co-op over BP we explain that the co-op-based specification defines a binding to DTLS. There are several DTLS security modes.

So that's why in the draft we state that the use of DTLS for COAP of not recommended and also if we've added minor detail that group of score protocol is used to secure co-op group committee next please Just one question on the security.

So yeah So we also explain that as the working group now very well there's bpsec which provides security services for BP it provides integrity and or confidentiality for one or more blocks of a bundle However, OSCorp also can protect with confidentiality and integrity a co-op message payload, one co-op message header field, and also some co-op options So we need to elaborate further this because, yeah, we can have security at two layers So is it like, do we need to just use one of the two layers? Do we need to use both or? in which case we need to do what? So we need to develop this further and any input that you may have is very much welcome And also about OSCOR"

Next please Finally, we have the IANA consideration section where we provide well, we request actually, the creation of two new reserved domains in the dot arpa namespace.

It's a convergence there protocol. A protocol force the converges layer adapter is the administrative element of an application agent. So all the protocol data units of that protocol take the form of BPD7 administrative records and get wrapped in bundles as a administrative records do in the same sort of way that we wrap bundle status of course which are likewise administrative records. We wrap those in bundles the protocol data units themselves look a little bit like this There are two types of people the bi-pdus, BP themselves look a little bit like this.

Instead, you're acknowledge, you get all those acknowledgements into a new administrative record that goes into responding bundle. The disposition code, whether it's custody accepted or not, and the sequences of transmission IDs pertaining to that disposition code are the rest of that administrative record. If the acknowledgement does not receive by the expected time, that's retained at the center for each of the bundles that went out as payloads of encapsulating bundles, then transmission of the encapsulating bundles is assumed to have failed, and the encapsulating bundle itself has re-forwarded by the source DPA DPA This, of course, adds some overhead because you've got a bundle bundle catalog encapsulation, which means you've got an extra bundle header. So the cost of doing this, you're buying that additional primary block, no way to get around that You might have a quality of service extension block that pertains to the encapsulating bundle You almost certainly want block integrity block targeting the primary and QOS blocks.

So I don't quite understand why you include the retransmission time because as a receiver I don't care, I just see retransmissions, or I receive duplicates. I don't know why I cannot it's important for the sender to have some kind of retransmission, but I don't understand why the receiver needs to know or I might be missed something it's it the receiver is aggregating the acknowledgments and so it needs some sort of guidance on when do I send my aggregated, aggregation of acknowledgements Yes, but I'm still speaking And knowing what time the sender of the early and deadline encapsulating bundle needs the answer by is a good cue for selecting a time at which you cut off aggregation and send it so please go ahead okay so you"

I can see that you might define them to the same value I just I wonder about that. My other question, was, can I have multiple bunch? in flight? while waiting for the, while waiting for the acknowledgement? Yeah, absolutely. Sure. Yeah if that's the case, what happens? if I lose an acknowledgement for one of, let's say, two bundles in flight, but I only get an acknowledgement for one? Well, it's aggregated acknowledgments So if you lose an acknowledgement, a custody of signature essentially, you're going to, you're going to have acknowledgments for multiple bundles All of those bundles retransmission, thresholds, time arcs will expire, and those individual bundles, will all get retransmitted. Okay, thank you Yep, we're good Let me jump in as well.

This is most because the IESG decided to shuffle around various groups within various areas and transport area has now very much become part of the web and transport area and that really made no sense for DTN as a whole male part of the internet area and that allows us to think of DTN as part of that wider making internet working work holistically rather than being a replacement for TCP Next slide, please So this is now the perfect time to re-charter.

And that is because the output of the DTN research group was the DTN Architecture document, which said, there is this thing called bundle protocol which solves a lot of the problems in the U use cases we have identified and we consider this to be good work for the IETF and so the DTN working group was originally chartered and reached again to focus on bundle protocol addressing what's out there addressing the use case with bundle protocol and fleshing out the full stack from top to bottom and included as part of that was of course the management piece. Now, as work on the management architecture proceeded, we received interest and feedback from the wider eye as work on the management architecture proceeded we received interest and feedback from the wider IETF community saying firstly we don't quite understand your use cases, but luckily we had documents which backed that up, which is great. And secondly, saying, well, I like what you're trying to do here, but I don't want to use bundle because I'm not talking about space I'm talking about other environments. And that was the first hint we started to have that delay and disrupt tolerance, although bundle protocol is a solution, may be part of a larger problem space that people are looking at So next slide, please I've got ahead of myself in the slides because this is what I'm trying to summarise So there is increased interest in people saying, I have a delay in disruption-tolerant use case"

So, I agree, we're raising the bar slightly for that then we can have a grown-up sensible technical objective discussion about things If I'm frank, angry exchanges on the mailing list is no good for anyone. It's divisive, it's destructive and there is a lot of commercial and government interest in this work, and it is only increasing and if the IETF fails to do relevant and correct things then that interest will move to alternate STOs and I personally believe the IET is probably the best STO for these kind of wide-ranging well thought out technical standards So, yeah.
