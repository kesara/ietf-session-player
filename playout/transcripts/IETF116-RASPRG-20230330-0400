And as you know, Ras is an asian ancient, but very good tool to make things better. And that's actually what we try to do here, but try to make standard setting better by getting better informed how it works. And I would actually functions in society. As you know, standard setting is a practice that goes back three centuries before Christ to the civilization in the Induced Valley where it's now currently Pakistan but we still don't really understand how it works. We had some time but also take some time to understand it even better. So let's get ready to grasp. The objective of this research group is to bring together researchers, practitioners, policymakers, standards users and standards. Developers to study standards processes in and across Sd dos. We want to inform the comprehension of standardization process and policies and possibly provide tools and insights to do so. What can we do? Well, we can do lots of things because one of the cool things of give on some other the authorization bodies as well is that they have not of data available from even before the Internet itself started. So we can look at the demographics of a standard setting. How people have joined idea for other standard authorization police."

Another example is for valerie nod, who's in the Ib she works for the center for democracy and technology. So I'm trying to figure out how how well folks from those kind of organizations can be here and participate here.

Now with other side of that, we know that much of the data around these decisions is publicly available. So in terms of outputs, we've got all of the internet drafts and Rf It atf. On the other side, behind those documents. We've also got the mailing list interactions. We've got meeting minutes. Attendance records. All of the data the the the data tracker keeps about participation and Ihs activities. So the question that the project trying answer then is can we use all of this open public available data to try and identify perhaps we're decision making isn't going well and to develop tools and methods for trying to improve that decision making process sense. Now the example on good stock right today is developing a tool for recommending Internet draft reviewers? This is motivated in part by some of the observations we've made around about a rat failings and what they say about the quality of documents. So if we look at all of the Standard track Rf, about a third of them attract at least one Rat failing that varies by area. It goes up to about forty percent for security. Area. But importantly, we found that Looking all of their filings, about seven percent of them are failed within thirty days of the Rf being published. And that doesn't necessarily mean that that was something obvious that could have been picked up.

Now the essential method that we're going to use here is we're going to try and distilled down Internet drafts into sort of vector that describes the topics and the themes that are present in those drafts. And then similarly, we're going to look at each participant in the mailing lists and trying to still their participation down and vector that describes the topics. And terms that they use the mailing lists. We're then gonna compare those two vectors and try and produce a recommended set of reviewers based on that. Now one of the methods that we're going use to train and s down documents vector is called T f id f. Stands for term frequency various document frequency. That method produces two numbers pair term that we see in each document. So I've got a quick example here. On the screen. We produced two numbers. So we have this term here.

So what we're doing here is essentially the same method this frequency various document frequency, I just described, this time we're going to take all of the interactions a given participant has had all of the contributions that made to public Lists, we're gonna con congratulate them together. Across a five year span, and then we're going to produce this vectors just in the same way. This time instead of characterizing a document we're characterizing participant in terms of their mailing list interactions. Okay. So now we've got these two vectors. We've got one for every single internet draft that's been produced. And then we've got one for every single participant that's participating and Icf mailing lists. So we're then just going to compare these two. We're going to use something called c sign similarity. Which basically plots these two vectors and two d space and looks for the distance between them. And we're going to produce a recommended set of reviewers. There's essentially based on far apart these two vectors are. We're going to say this is a draft that contains the terms quick and congestion window, should look for reviewers whose topics And the mailing list discussions align with the topics of that draft. Which seems fairly straightforward. Now we've developed this tooling. And there's a quick aside. This tooling is ab testing a couple of different strategies. That I'm not going to describe here.

Of topics, and they describe c selling some similarity for comparing the two vectors. We also test machine learning techniques for doing the same job. As I say, we've developed this too. A screenshot of it here. That's fairly straightforward to use. So it's gonna ask you for the name of the draft that you want review a recommendation far. By default when you press search, it's gonna give you a list of five names, five participants that it thinks would be good reviewers for that draft. That you've asked about. Give you links to their data tracker profile and it will give you a list of the drafts that they've offered just to give you a bit more context about not person and why they might be a good reviewer for the draft. You see drop down boxes along the right hand side. That's just to give us some feedback about whether they not the reviewers that we're suggesting or the tools suggesting whether or not they are good choices. Those are automatically fed back into the model. And hopefully, we'll that we make better suggestions further on. Can see that's mode drop down here. By default, we're looking for people given the method that I just described for people that are most similar to the draft you're looking for reviewers far but there's a couple of other modes. You can ask for review expertise in a given Area, so perhaps you want security. People are active in the security. So only consider contributions to security mailing lists. And then the third mode asks you for a list of existing reviewers for the draft. And the tool will then try and find complementary reviewers. So look for people are dissimilar to the set people. Already looking. So to say this is public available.

I didn't note though that You know, there's are some folks I think in the That maybe are really good at writing and producing documents and we have a lot of Rf some overlap with that.

And I think related to that, we don't for sort of that are ten meetings, but perhaps are not as active on the mailing list or people that of documents but again or not perhaps sector from the mailing list.

My question is, whether you could tell us more tells about the nature of the categories or the errors that were found. We're talking about typos on style or you misplaced the plus in the minus and on the rocket blew up. Because in one case, you need people with longtime time experience to fix it.

But I've got much more detail about the statistics we found. I think to answer K point we think that making data driven choices is perhaps better than not making data driven choices.

So I I think the the thing that kind of sets us apart sort explains the longevity of the project, is that from the beginning, it was sort of modeled other successful open source communities with like, a lightweight governance process, which keeps going. Right? So it's essentially governed by consensus of the core developers or core commit, who are the core developers, It's people that are active are consistent in their contributions and if someone is active and consistent enough and their contributions, they might be recognized by consensus of the other people who are active their contributions.

Well, we really have to talk about that. So you're familiar with iterative. Proposal processes, there's a lightweight version of that.

This is super helpful. Thank you for presenting. So I had or the practical logical question. The the problems that any kind of these tools always run into is that some of the things that you measure on the eye of the holder. Gender, being a really good example, Right? Like, most people or a lot of people tend to maybe not fall on the binary. Mh. Whereas these kind of methods tend to say, you are a one or a zero, you are male or female, and that's just not the reality of the place. And related to that, I was wondering how you dealt with issues around the fact that what is considered to be offensive yes or no is highly determined. And like how you take these kind of nuances into control walls also wanting to be able to say something that's useful. Yes. Thank you. So that is how my my work And this was a comment I had at my defense as well is that why am I not considering the demographic attributes as features in my analysis. I don't. So I'm not labeling my the people that I'm doing as any any label of male female. So when you when you run my, they are data driven. Radically. So they're unsupervised So they not labeled. So if there are, let's say, in the population, let's say, ten different genders. Then they will come up as ten different clusters. So I cannot label them. I may be able to label them...

And I have some results for one million from three gb six. We can see for example for the type location. Apparently, people like to talk about San Francisco, the most"

One thing to note is that So the extracted person and it is here with this model they also align with the sender receiver information analysis from the metadata. So that also qualitatively valid our detection. And here, we have more and it is for different types. So what interesting thing is it's very exciting to see the models is able to extract terms like Rf, Internet protocol, for the organizations, we can extract Cp, etcetera. But the... The models also have lots noises. For example for this type digits. So all of these results are very exciting because it's it shows a great quantitative tool for extracting entity informations from the email bodies. And we can extract information with different types. But there are still some disadvantages For example, I we need the label data to fine tune the model. If we want to have good performance. But normally we don't have lots of labeled dataset. And also, we The model is limited with only a fixed sales of page. So if you want to extract for example, animals, You cannot with the cards model. And also, for this model, we can only extract and the information. So how can we go west step further? One interesting data format that we can extract is knowledge graph. So knowledge graphs of real word with their relationships. But extracting knowledge graphs for our"

    "text": "minimalist is challenging because we have a very specialized domain we don't have a unified sc up. But after we have those extracted knowledge graphs, can imagine there are many more interesting applications for example, we can store the extract information into a structured data format and they are connected, and we can do further intervention on them. So sorry. So yeah. Knowledge graphs that are very useful. But how can we extract them? We use G three. So g three is in the Dvd model family, and the full name is Pre trained transformers to One of its most obvious these characteristics it's got it's very huge. So Jimmy three has hundred and seventy five billion. But bird has only a hundred and ten million parameters. So means it's fifteen hundred. Times larger than burnt and even compared to its own family it's a hundred times larger than the previous version to. And the way that we use Gp three is to do prompt engineering with the open Ai Apis. So we can ask literally any question, and we can ask it to extract not only entities relations and or information we want with different types. But One problem is we don't have any access to the other line trend width. So we cannot debug. We cannot do any intervention on the model itself and also it costs money. So but how is the results? Here, we have two extracted knowledge graphs went from the package Kg creator and another. From just an overview we can see with Three, we can tried a much more information enriched knowledge graph. But I know you cannot now see the nose and relations. That's why also have tables."

    "text": "So with the knowledge graph extracted by the knowledge Kg creator, we have very limited and it entities. We're gonna types and we also don't have relations, but with jimmy three, we have not only entities with their types we also have the relationships between them. And from this one overview from this one example we can see the quality is a lot better with. So the way that we used three is to design this natural language prompt. So here the prompt I'm using is with one example. So first, provide one example to the model. We here I provide one very generic example with extracted and religions. And then I just have to embedded in our body. To it. And the model can just is magic. We do have limitations and concerns. So one of the biggest concern is that we have privacy and optical issues So I guess we would like not to send our data, especially if it's private. To another company. And also it costs more when the amount of emails goes up. So for two million emails, it will cost around seventeen thousand dollars And also it's very slow. It takes around one minute to process one api call. And again, we don't have any control. Over these large gp tv family models. But still, I'm still working on this research. So in the future, we would like to first noise the results given some constraints and we can optimize our prompts. Also would like to have a local model that can achieve comparable models."

Well, I'm super sorry, but we unfortunately don't have time quest but I hope this was an inaugural session in which you got like a little taste of the directions in which this research group can go but the direction in which it will go, we will need to decide together. So please help us bring up your suggestions, comments and Ig ideas on the mailing list, feel free to come up to us after the session, or talk to us or the Ir chair after this Thanks so much presenters for all your great research and all these different directions for making it all open source and looking forward to the next session in in the meantime? Happy hacking. Later everybody"
