    "text": "and so in order to add on demand to RA there are a number of ways it exists we started off with thinking about modifying RI itself to create a vendor specific option and after hearing all the worst war stories and scars from Suresh we decided this is probably not a good way to go and then we start looking at well what are the actual things we need to get done and what are the right ways to do this and ultimately we came to the decision that you know the bottom two ways are kind of the ways we can handle this one is creating something at the prefix option level and so you know the prefix option gives you you know for a persist specific prefix you know various options that you can use and we decided that it might be useful to do this in the prefix option itself the only drawback there is that it would require the modification of reserved fields so if we create a prefix option that\u0027s kind of alongside the prefix option it feels like it\u0027s at the wrong level but slightly cleaner but if we put it inside the prefix option itself then we need to modify one of the reserved fields to specify the prefix type so this is kind of where we are now and you know one of these options will most likely need to be considered in order to provide the different SSE mode specifications in our 8 next light so we\u0027re here to see if there is any interest in continuing us work we\u0027ve written a draft that\u0027s a reference here if you would like to take a look at it and either contact myself or Danny we\u0027d be happy to talk to you to get Michael Abraham\u0027s them so me and Eric Cline we have a graph that\u0027s talking about the X bit which I guess there was some coordination because you\u0027re not stomping on that one which is a good thing yeah I think you should bring this to six-man oh right Danny was at the six man and weed oh yes I\u0027m worried okay yes no no there\u0027s no but I don\u0027t think there it\u0027s good you know we\u0027re not talking there is the the whole orbit that is not in your draft so there is actually an RC that\u0027s defining one of those that is reserved "
