I'm in Nova Scotia Canada and appreciate the opportunity to talk to you today or tomorrow. I'm a policy adviser with the mozilla Corporation who make the open source Firefox browser and what I'm going to talk to you today about is an open data standard for describing terrestrial fiber optic networks. Next slide, please. So this this project began with an initiative that I began almost over ten years ago, was to try and map terrestrial fiber projects in Africa. And I naive assumed that that it would be possible crowds source, the information simply gathering network maps from various operators and producing a comprehensive picture. And what you see here, is not bad. It's probably about seventy percent of the fiber networks in Africa. But once you"

Next slide, please. And indeed, you know, as you know, we begin to see infinite internet infrastructure as an essential component of modern life. I think the the pandemic has revealed to just how fundamental it is to carrying on in difficult circumstances Well, if we are going to really understand the challenge of connecting everyone to the Internet Authority afford, we need better information than that Yep. Better information starts with the very foundations of the Internet. That is the fiber optic cables that carry vast of Internet traffic around the world. So next slide, please. This issue she really only came home to me when a couple of research is jonas jorge to Jonas Pulse and approached me to to ask to use the dataset that I compiled to build this map of terrestrial fiber cables in Africa.

And I think this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what may be achieved. Next slide, please. And in terms of sharing, it's it's funny. You know, some operator no hesitation sharing detailed maps. Of their fiber network on their websites in some cases downloadable. Excuse me downloadable in K or other, you know, detailed data format. And and others will not share their information at all. And the perceptions by these various by these operators in terms of what is appropriate in terms of sharing you know, it's not grounded in anything except This is what we've always done. So part of the the goal of this project to the open private data standard is simply to to create new norms. For sharing and to build greater trust among operators to do so because it's clear that the operators that are sharing their data you know, haven't haven't suffered any catastrophic failures as a result. Even, you know, here you could see there's fiber network protein in Ukraine. Let's still sharing. A map of its fiber network. Next slide, please. And there are existing initiatives.

Which means you get a great looking map but you can't download that data to reveal the kinds of insights that I I think our are just waiting to to be had. So while it's an excellent resource, be... Because it's not open data, it's not accessible. It's not really useful as a research resource. Next slide, please. So thanks to some interest from the World Bank.

So if you can actually have an accurate map of where existing fiber is and overlay say over population data then you you can, you know, you can target investments where where they can have the biggest impact. And here, on the right hand side, this is map from Ghana, where fiber networks have been overlaid with rail networks and oil and gas pipeline networks. And and power line infrastructure. And being able to overlay those different kinds of data can also reveal opportunities to to deploy fiber in in more affordable ways. It's much cheaper to rent fiber along a power line or along a rail line than to actually, you know, trench it in the ground. And having this data available can improve coordination in terms of investment and reduce the chances of physical network interruption. And indeed, once you have a common standard, can actually then begin to look at accurate benchmarking from country to country state to state. Next slide, please. But maybe maybe the most remarkable benefit of having an open data standard. Is you can actually tell how much fiber you have in your country. Because right now, if you're... If you're a regulator and you you were require operators to submit maps of their fiber optic network. To you Well, they they may submit a map where they they argue that they have fiber but Is it their fiber? Is it dark, and dark fiber they purchased from another operator, is it lit capacity from another operator. This is a a good example here. This is a map of fiber between rio And Sao paulo in Brazil.

So, you know, kinda that confidently post that that they have, you know, three hundred thousand kilometers of fiber in their country Well, there's no basis for that for an accurate picture of that. Unless you actually are able to to compare eggs with eggs. Next slide, please. And the next one. So this is good for operators as well. This is a news article from Mt in Ghana. From last year. Saying that suffered from nine hundred and thirty nine cuts in five months, which is today. Must be some kind of record. I imagine. But and there are various reasons for that. Lack of information is definitely a key factor and there is actually research to back that up. And so by promoting more transparency, and creating standards for sharing we can directly address this problem, which will actually reduce the amount you know, lower cost for operators. And also having more strategic information about where fiber is. It is remarkable the number of times I have seen investment as actual duplication of infrastructure because two parallel processes we're leading to investment in the same place. And, you know, part of the reason that I think that operators don't wanna to share is that they don't want to be the they don't wanna share any more than their competitor."

So They brought a lot of expertise in history to to the development to work with us and it's been a a genuine pleasure to work with them Next slide, please. And just before I go on to describe the standard in in a little bit more detail I just wanna give you an example of where an open data standard has worked tremendously well. So if you used Google maps to get around in New York or London or any other major capital and they've used it to identify the the, you know, the transit points a subway the underground The reason you can do that is because Google developed an open data standard for to describing public transport. So... And you could see that here that they are fields for... Or you know tables for describing the trips, roots, you know, stop times, fairs and so on. And because all transit authorities can submit data in the same format, Google Maps is able to represent that data in a timely and meaningful way Next slide, please.

Can we come back? It starts with the network, which then breaks down into what we call notes and spans. So notes would be what you would think of as a point of presence. And spans are the is the network that connects two nodes. And that's really heart of the standard, and the rest of it connects to who owns it who operates who invested in it. When did it get live what kinds what is the technical capacity of the network, etcetera, etcetera. It provides operators with a vocabulary and a structure for talking about their networks. And, of course, it provides documentation to to help people use the standard and applied it and having applied it software tools to to validate it. So of making sure that the data is consistent and whole and and accurate. Next slide. Please. And you're at the fifteen minute Mark Steve? Okay. Great. Thanks. And so you know, like any good open data or open source initiative. It's available on on Github. And you can...

The data you've created is consistent with itself will accept data in Excel format in comma separated far format in Geo jason and Jason format. And as long as you can upload it in one of those formats, it will convert it to to the other formats for you. So the... Right now our focus has been on developing this standard, but the very next step for us as we work with operator associations around the world is to begin to develop the tools for displaying and interrogating and analyzing these these datasets. And and maps. Next slide, please And so in order now, having developed a standard and gone through kind of alpha and beta process and now we're at version just on the verge of version point three of of the data standard, It is we begun to sort of attest it in the wild as it were. In particular, we've been working with the regulatory agencies in Ghana in Kenya, to to introduce the standard and to develop mechanisms for its adoption. At the same time as we've been working with the regulatory associations, we're also working with the operator associations with the hopefully with the the goal of of having the standard be voluntarily up it by operators as opposed to mandated by the regulatory agencies.

And that really brings me to the end of my presentation. I'm happy to to entertain questions or comments Is no stranger to standards processes and, you know, the big challenge for us at the moment is setting up the governance processes for the standard and trying to do it in a way that is sufficiently democratic, but also lightweight enough to to move forward quickly.

I guess my initial question is how you imagine organizations, how do you imagine organizations using the standard. Is this individual tel? Formatting the data in this way and sending it to you or to some centralized organization that manages all this, or do these organizations simply publish that data on their own websites for other people to crawl. Yeah. It's a great question. And one to which I don't know the answer yet. I mean, our fundamental principle of the work has been to you know, respect the sovereignty of the operators to control their own network information so ultimately, that will be their decision. I expect there will be different kinds of data or at different grades of fiber data and that there will be a a subset is available for public consumption. There'll be a subset that may be just available to an association of operators that might have a little more sensitive information and there maybe yeah you know, a more robust version that is just private to to the operator. Itself. I think in my perfect world, I you know every operator would publish their own and it would be harvested from him. I think that's probably not a practical reality. Just in that it's not gonna something that people place enough priority on. I expect the operator"

And that would sort of solve a lot of problems. I think if if there was a kind of standardized reporting all operators already report. That data to regulators. So there is that kind of information already just a question of standardizing it. And I think right now, I mean, we're learning more about how operators is store this information. Somewhat surprisingly for me. Most of it is just in Google Earth. And Google earth is a lovely tool but it is horrible for metadata and structured data. So I think our next goal is really to develop the tools that will that will make it easy for operators to to convert their data into the standard. Thank you very much. We have Mark Thank you, Curtis.

They may well be a beneficiary of the of the standard and the publication of that data. I have to say it's funny you should mention tele geography because I, you know, they obviously, they publish these submarine fiber cable map, which I think you know and probably everyone has has seen. And they... Up until very recently, they store that data on Github. Under a creative commons license so that anyone who wanted to use that submarine cable data can could could use it. Sadly, they've they've deleted their github account. And And now that data is is you know, will cost you money to license.

And just to highlight how really amazing some of this work that you're doing Steve is is that I put a note in the chat about broadband mapping in the United States. I've been involved with some small communities who are trying to protest some of the data coming out of the Cc and Fcc has kindly opened up windows to allow for that type of protest but if you're a new operator and you're trying to become a last mile operator, to serve a community that's un served or underserved and yet the maps better a regulator might have would indicate quote that the community served and that there's fiber to Steve's point if you use some of the the open data standard you could actually push back and say, look, no, There isn't, and or it needs a little bit of competition.

Of which there was a draft created in the early days of gaia really specifying some of the terminology and technologies and best practices in kind of remote and frontier networks. And cod those inside of the so that there's some formal and something to point out for people trying to build out this. Now we looked it over. And there is some stuff to be updated not as much as we had anticipated. It turns out it's a lot of rural wireless networks, but there's no friends. For instance no covering of Lte. I think a lot of the space networks have come in and I are having fairly large impacts on the kind of networks that we care about. And an improved focus on on P's as well.
