Please wear the masks unless you actively speaking, and the mic. I think it's all four housekeeping. Yes. We need minute takers. This is going to be very short meeting not much work. So I do appreciate if anyone... Someone could volunteer care for this. Please. Someone We don't have transcription even Okay. I need to be very careful what I'm saying. So you could be look in the transcript. Oh, Thank you. Very much appreciate it. And if you say anything my, okay. Recommend you to look in minutes and correct our updates what you think you. Okay. So, a agenda wise, very short meeting my apologies you know like, last couple of times, we had a very, very full agenda.

Not march the our working group document, passport properties purchase is is currently in Irish paul So on the way to Rf. We do not have any other document in the group. So should the group. List just the draft. I I know that outside people are working on some documents and we had go to hear about that. Very soon. About currently, Nothing. So Brian, do you want me to cover this so we you want to speak on. Yeah. So as James said, this time we, you know, look at the last few agendas we've had, and we said are we two hours a lot and have about thirty minutes out of stretch this morning. Looking at sort of where we are, It... It's pretty clear if the saw work is progressing and we're gonna have a fairly we in presentation discussion on that. But like beyond that, there doesn't seem to be a lot of demand for discussion work in the research group at the moment. This gonna be an Right? Like... So the idea is that the is the the the drafts sort of progress I expect initial graphs go through the submissions queue. We look where that engage with the rest of the It process.

And then to basically hold anything that we would have for San francisco so for the one eighteen meeting in prague. We can revisit this on the list if there's, like, in the interim need to do a and into meeting, we can... You know, we've done a few of those and those have work out really well. We can can definitely do a virtual interim. But we were propose not to meet at one seventeen in San for Francisco. Again, this is a proposal first discussion on these points. Please take it to the list. So, yeah, if you'll have been simple about presenting in some in San Francisco? Please let us know because of slaves, there is a interested engine agenda and it is on the list, we will be happy from. We just do not want to spend time with you, not getting enough agenda items. Okay. So I think this is all from the chairs and Nicolas nicole io? You okay. Good. The floor is yours. Let me start sharing your slides. Sign of the. Do you give me... Yes You go.

So before going to the draft, I wanted to to say something about what has been happening in in the sign ecosystem in the last few months since I think we lost met in London. So some news about productive deployments, as far as you probably have heard, you know that the biggest productive deployment of Cy in the finance industry in Switzerland, So there is this network called the secure side finance network. And this is based on si. So whenever you pay money from one bank to the other, then the clearing systems need to talk to each other. And this network is now being migrated to cy. So the latest update here is that while this network until today, it was partially being onboard on cy, now by September twenty twenty four, this will be fully migrated to science, so that means that think a few hundreds of finance institutions will actually be connected to the network. So this will definitely increase the size of the let's say biggest deployment will give us additional experiences The other update is that Cy is also expanding to other industries. So in Switzerland it's also a network that connects hospitals, practices, doctors and so, This is run by a company called Hai or health. And in end of last year, they also had the initial set up for sign network. So the idea here is to expand iron also to to the swiss healthcare ecosystem and to make sure that they can you know, use the geo fencing properties at the path properties. To communicate between hospitals, doctors and so on."

On the education side, then there is also an initiative led by the university of To actually roll out global sign education network here the idea is to deploy science to education institutions both to allow experimentation by researchers and so on. So this is already being rolled out at a couple of universities in Europe I think there also support by She and by some other end. And so it's good to see that there is also some developments in this direction another development is that we got the Siren association created, it's actually an association of companies that actually build and create the same network So I'm actually myself now working for the association. Our goal is to try to improve and grow the design community actually took over the open source implementation of Science so now this is a bit more maintaining a more structured way. And so we hope that this will also increase the quality of the open source. So next slide, please? So back to the draft. Where do we stand today? So if you never heard about siren, you probably might wanna go to this siren overview draft. That you see on the left? And this graph gives you an overview of basically the design goals of Cy, the key properties that it provides it talks a bit about the components. We have had quite some lengthy discussions here at Pan I think last year, And one of the main feedback is that Si is a big system. So there was a bit the need to try to let's say split or identify the core components and how they interact"

Telling a bit what are the main blocks of science what are their inputs outputs and how they relate to existing product goals. Besides that, we have individual drafts about each one of the three main components. So the control plane P I, the control plane itself and the data plane. The P is the only draft that is published at the moment. We were actually hoping to have also the control plane ready for Dc etf. We unfortunately could not make it, but we have it, I think in in a good state. So we hope that for the next one, this would be ready. So maybe because of that maybe we might also see if if we might be discussing that at at the next idea for so, just regarding what Gen said about the next meeting. But we can take it on the list. So yeah. Stay tuned on the list, we will let you know soon as this is available. So going to the specific draft, you go to the next slide, On the component analysis, we did some some minor adjustments for now. One is about vocabulary. So now that's the vocabulary for positive networking graph is getting to more final state. We started looking at that and I think there would be a great inputs to use a more precise terminology. So the first word that I think many people found a bit found a bit confusing was this about end hosts. So we we renamed them into endpoints according to vocabulary draft. An end endpoint is basically where design word terminate and where when you have either own and host or whether you have may be an an Ip network. So it's basically the edge between the same word and to Ip word."

So I think it's It's a bit early to discuss how it works in detail. But we have been thinking about it internally and we think this could make a lot of sense in in the long term even though the current version of science that is deployed today actually using the sign. It's a cy. Data plane header. So I think this is a discussion that we we'll be able to have in in some time. Updated some references there is still some work to be done on this draft on interoperability continue on reviewing the terminology. So we actually plan to spend a bit more time reviewing this draft in the upcoming months. So if you have any feedback, or any ideas on how this can be improved. I think this would be great time to to let us know. Moving on to the next topic and also to the next slide, if you can go to the... Okay. That's good. So there is this overview draft. For now we able to do some minor changes also on terminology similarly to the previous draft on on the language in general. There is still quite a lot of work to do here. So we'll also work on this draft before the next e. One thing is that we will try to have the main components specified in in separate drops, as I mentioned earlier, so we'll try to remove some of content from this draft. Now it's white lengthy if you have seen it And at the same time, I think we should pan a bit on the deployment section on how science can be employed. I think some folks have asked about a life of a pocket. Perhaps. If that could help understanding sign and maybe some diagrams. Overall, the goal of this draft is to just"

So we also... Do you hear me, by the way? Yes. Loud. You you want to share a cream? No. No. No no. I was No. Positive mistake. Yes. So we published the T draft in middle of last year, and we got also feedback from various reviewers among which was H from the community. Thank you very much. And also from the sign, deaf community and they try to address that feedback. Then among this we also... Or or one of the things was that we correctly the number of allocations of the sign isolation domains. We also made it more precise. Or specified it was it was a bit very global range and now we just gave it a little bit more precise... What is it locations? Then the tentatively revised and shorten the certificate difficult specifications. Section, it was very descriptive and also the certificates we use are based r x five o nine version three certificates difficult and in the first version of the draft. We also described this these certificate types in general, but now we only focus on the specific sign constraints and conditions."

So in or we really try to make it a bit more compact. There is also the control picking I is the base of it is some kind of trust configuration, which is there is signing ceremony of the this base trust configuration and the previous draft had details description of that. It's still there, but I moved it to the appendix because this is more like policy how you could do it, but it is not must. So he thought it should not be really be in the main part of the draft. And then the improved the references because it it now is has really... It's now divided in norma references and other ones But at least Yes. They are now better how do you say it's and divided Yeah. That is is it, so it is now is this second version is online. And if you want to have a look please go ahead. Here are really welcome every feedback. So And then it's not on the slide yet, but I'm working on the of the and on this control plane draft, and and also... We also hope that we can submit this one in the next couple of months. So Yes. As Nicolas said, it would be nice to present draft on the next, and we can see in which meeting that this would be But... Yes. That was our plan. That's okay. That's it for me."

I wanted to say that I've been really interested in your is her about the link between say pain and the previous extension header. And if I may, I would like to help on that if you Yep. Thanks. So as I mentioned, this is for now an idea. I think there's lots of open questions about how you would actually do the interoperability. I think the goal here would be to perhaps work on on a prototype and see how how this works. For example, one question is where how do you map Ip address was sign an Is a yes. Is sixty four bits Can you squeeze it into the Ip address for maybe in the in some of the pizza. Do you need a mapping system? I think this is open. We want to get there, but for us for now, we really want to focus now finishing the three main drops. So we have to prioritize that and I think we can keep this discussion in sure. In there because I think this will be interesting. Still, I think the goal for now with the three main drops you to try to document the existing deployments. So the way ion is deployed is as I mentioned on the only. So data plane, are probably the first version will be will be with the deciding data plane, but I think this could be for further work that we could maybe be doing Well, I'm not sure Maybe he's group or somewhere else.

Yes. Okay. I was about with some four. So You you me to get to isn't? You yeah. To get into bro. Yes. I I that's... I think it should be possible. Yes. Probably easier to get a bunch of swiss network operators to the tracker republic than it is to the West Coast the Us. I Just... I... I'm just checking sort of my assumptions about is be easier to have our next meeting on this. In broad versus San Francisco and I I I think my assumption is holding here. Okay. Very cool. Clarification question that I think goes back to Ant antoine a little bit on the data plane stuff. So the deployments that exist, so there's the Ss deployment and then the the healthcare deployment in Switzerland. Those are using clarify, those are using the scion data plane, not like an Ip six data plane, but they're using it endpoint to endpoint. So these are basically tunnel of endpoints as opposed to end house to end host. Correct? Or is this all the way to sort of the server info? They using the signed plane, the deployment is mostly based on the design to Ip gateway. So a siren checkpoint point is actually the gateway and then you have ip host that then... Oh Great. So it's more sort of thing than like, in application engineering thing. Right? Like so it's it's actually... It's being used primarily as a network engineering tool to build. To build tunnels that have properties that like other tunnels don't. Correct. In some way, yes, I'm not sure if you can strictly talk about tunnels, but Okay. Cool. So... Okay. Actually, yeah. These are all questions that I would love to ask some of those people. Let's see if we can figure out a way to get the. Yeah. Absolutely. Cool."
