    "text": "maybe somebody can rephrase it a little bit but I think that all the advice that has given in that text every piece of it is needed okay then there is your way - yeah this is Ben I heard someone say appendix if normative text here please don\u0027t move normative takes to an appendix this one is not normal oh yeah really this text should have more normative tech you know it should have more capitalized words in it not like this is stuff that you really need to get right if you want to do a good implementation so I mean I\u0027m okay so and if we add more normative ministère we shouldn\u0027t put it the appendix so what I\u0027m reading here is that we\u0027re gonna actually keep this here and Cohen will you recommend what should be stronger language or are you okay with the current one I\u0027m fine with the current one but I\u0027m one of these people who believes that if I write text like it\u0027s super important that you set the X bit to Y and the protocol will totally fail if you don\u0027t set it to Y that that is normative text and does not require the word must in caps for things to be normative text so I\u0027m fine with this as it is but many people seem to feel that if the word must isn\u0027t there it\u0027s not normative so I\u0027m on the fence and this paragraph partly because whatever at the top of the paragraph is something that each system needs to each our DP system needs to cater for that irrespective wise so and the second bit which is about the marker bit I think some of the text already exists in RFC 3550 about the talkSPORT the question is is this guidance really needed in ice for it if you have a reference we\u0027re more than happy to use that well it does say 3550 recommends the MA Quebec to be said because at Oxford and I think that that is probably already in 3550 in the first part which says that you know if parts change the jitter buffer will need to be adapted is something that every 35 50 implementation kind of takes care of okay let\u0027s try to keep it all let\u0027s try to keep discussing on the microphone so we have it recorded so what I\u0027m saying is that the first paragraph it talks about the fact that the jitter buffer would need to be adapted because the ice "
