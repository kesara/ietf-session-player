Thank you, John. John is going to take notes. Thanks. Appreciate it. this update since the last meeting in Yokohoma, the segment routing IPV 6 for mobile user plane document is the work is complete. ISG has approved it prior to that, and, subsequently, the document was published as rfc9433. Congratulations to the authors, to the working group, a lot of efforts went into this. I realized that POCs and many things, very good work. Good work. Good work. Excellent. lots of good discussions, debates. You know, I think that's all part of the game, but Good stuff. Good stuff.

I mean, there were some substantial comments in the last meeting that the authors have looked at. if we go to the next page, I'll try to outline what the changes are Okay. Great. So the updates from the previous version to what it is now is addressing the 3 broad comments that came up even though there were only 3, 1 or 2 of them required some significant changes, and I'll go over each of them. as I walk through the slides. So first, let me just say what each of those are. The first one is was about mobility aware And what does that mean in the context of this slide? sorry. Not the slide, but the draft. and you know, this draft has been in progress for some time. It it preceded the work in teas and a lot of the progress in 3gpp2. So it's been around for a few years. So The notions have changed. There's work in tees that identifies how the slices are handled. There's been progress in 3gppin the management section on 28 dotxxxxslides. So all of that you know, given I think I've taken the action to remove the mobility aware from everywhere except the title."

It's fully transparent So that's where it is at. And I think as a group. maybe we need to have some thoughts about do we need to change the title? Is that okay? Or, I mean, I can think of titles and maybe propose around the list. But that's something we should think about. Will it confuse readers later on? So because a method that's proposed in this draft is something like a UDP source port based mapping for 5g slices. So that's, you know so we could think You know, if people have strong opinions about that, we can think about changing the title But, anyway, that's where this is at. in terms of addressing, you know, so if you have any thoughts on that, Happy to. Happy to -- So so, John, one question. Right? When you say take that. Then then change change it to vertex. So can it cook cook put some more thoughts, actually, I think. I'm not fully getting the yeah. Okay. Maybe I went too quickly on that. So -- Yeah. -- one thought that I would think about as a UDP base a UDP source port basedbasedbased mapping from 5g to transport slicing. transport slices.

That's good one. to answer Sree's point, I think we have now fully aligned, and I'll cover it up in the in the next two bullets. Now on this on the the title itself maybe do you think it's an okay idea to start a thread on that and ask the group? you know, make a couple of proposals. Maybe others have ideas and see where where this ends I'll do that right after the this week or maybe early next week. Okay. Okay. Next slide. No. No. Still, I I wanna just go through the next two points. Alright. if I may. So the the general cleanup and revision, you know, so this was again related to whole bunch of changes we need to make to make because there were there were readability parts and also duplication that we removed to make sure that it is both aligned with the t's work and also not duplicating anything from 3gpp per se. We're only referring to it, but you know, just context to provide readability that you could go go to the 28 dot or 25 dot x x slide. graphs or or or standards in 3gpp. k.

But I've removed what also the working group has asked me to do in terms of terminology and concepts that are there in t's another working group? k? So that's in the next slide. Okay. So here, the changes are simple. it's fairly basic to say simple but important, I think, because 1 of the changes that was asked was t not have much 5g terminologies. So, essentially, we've kept that 5 g management plane and referred to functions there. and not create another name like DNO. So that's the main change. not not it doesn't affect the draft significantly, but it's cleaning it up to say it's referring to 5 g. standards. And so everything that's in the figure. I don't wanna walk through the whole you know, what this is about because I think we've done it several times. But very briefly, I'll say that it's a question about mapping from what's in the 5g how 5g manages slices to how that's associated to the the IP network transport slice. Okay.

So the hierarchy here and I'll I'll spend a little time to go through what it is. You have communication services for 5g. that are associated to one or more slices you know, that's identified by an NSS AI. So for example, communication service b may be served by a network slice b, which is identified or a network slice a. and each of those network slices operate I mean, our in these virtual NSSI is the network slice subnets. that consist of core and radio aspects. And there is an interconnection between them, which is the IP slice that we are expanding on here. the transport part. And the question is how is that mapped. between what 3g what a 3gppendpoint, like an EP transport. is mapped to 5g and carried over to the IP network. such that the IP network can map it to the corresponding service requirements in the 5gnetwork.

So in this case, the configuration the mappings are shown below. So, basically, the 3gpp configuration is to say that the service and the network slice is now for example, in this case, 000b. which is mapped to a network slice subset AN 2, because that's the the 3gpp access network slice. And the those slice mapping again going into detail would you know, what what go to the end transport which says the SNSS AI is 000 b. The logic interface type is a new one. That's that is what we're proposing in this graph, which is a UDP source port.

So and for the world specific, it like it's more likely integration of host aided and a nano based since the the EU will get involved. by providing its capability to the network, and the network will negotiate based on the some sagging. So this is, like, integration between the whole integration of the host and the network, most both. So one question here. Where does MP quick I host capable of MP, quick, or MPTCP fit into this overall scheme. with respect to capability indication. Oh, m p a quick part MP, those time it's going to have the decision based and also the IP based.

I think the remaining action is in 3gpp, and I would suggest probably the best to do is, like, send a liaison statement saying, hey. Like, you know, like, you know, this is allowed to do it.

So in between or during ITf6 116 and in between the two ITS until now, we had good discussion on the mailing list and also offline. And we said, let's give the topic a little bit more room, and we organized site meeting during this week last Monday, and we had a small room, but the room was pretty crowded.

So the discussion point per per last IETF was So first of all, is there interest? Is there a value in doing doing these things. And according to the feedback and discussion we had, we understand there is interest in value in doing that. but not coming with the specification next week, but looking more at the problem and looking at space where we may need documentation because there may be technology already doing that. Or maybe we find some gaps that are worthwhile standardizing. Right? So that's a a procedure we want to enter. And So a couple of reference points where we could do documentation or closer investigate for example, between the two control planes, could see which semantic could apply here. to enforce that kind of end to end traffic steering in the view of session continuity, Different control planes in the transport network may apply here too. on Also, on the data plane, different product may be used. We could make use of encapsulation of segment routing, anything may may apply here. So we could look at different options here. But later we see we found something else that could be done in the view of data plane. monetization Next slide, this During the IETF, last March, And in between, various aspects have been addressed, going even beyond the traffic steering aspect.

So if we talk about edge computing, so mid session maybe their network decides that the EU should continue its service from another edge. Right? And in that case, mobility domain need to follow by assigning a new UPF that's close to the new data network. So all these scenarios is something we could look at. u e to u e communication, So it's also particular. So it usually has its mobility anchor. So how to treat the traffic in a good way in case 1, UEs mobility anchor gets changed. Right? the same problem, but not between a hub router but between 2 UEs. and their mobility anchors. So different scenarios is what we looked at. And Here, of course, we need to see we don't wanna reinvent the wheel. So we will need to see which technology other groups, standard groups, or inside the IETF Maybe there is technology that can be beneficial here. Next one? Okay. So briefly from from Jeffrey, we got a presentation about a general architecture, problems based with the hubpe and 2 user plane functions, which are the mobility anchors. which get relocated mid session And so here, in particular, a problem which may appear if You looked at, switch the path.

Two slides before we come to the actual summary, So we learned that Not always. the problem applies to to to any kind of architect So we had Joel in the in the session that was a good comment that If the data networks in a different autonomous system, Maybe it does not bother with a switch of the mobility anchor here.

From all these reference points and function that we looked at, So two of them seem to be more promising and that we could look at in in more detail. and have some initial documentation. So one is case we have an architecture which applies a transport controller we could look at the semantics that apply in the transport control and the mobility control plane. That gives a lot of flexibility to not only initiate such a mobility and career location in the mobility domain and follow in the transport network. But if transport network or data network decides to change data network, we could request the change in mobility anchor assignment in the 3 tpp domain. So that kind of semantic could be very generic in the view of control messages, semantics, information models that could be useful also for other mobility standards to follow and see how to interwork with these approaches. other one is the big arrow here, which applies to any kind of transport in the routing domain. And in particular, the end market concept to tackle a little bit the problem of the reordering of data plane packets during such a path switch, that's something we also plan to look at. Next one. As we also learned, there is not always an architecture, and that that that relies on a transport network controller.

What are the things you base down to steer? the u e traffic. In the end 6 reference point or No. No. No. Whatever proposal you have here, what are the bases? Are you based on processing time or network delay or service delay, what other things? What if the data network is an edge computing domain? Uh-huh. And the mobility domain because of mobility of the UV, for example, decides to relocate the Mhmm. Then you may need to steer from this edge computing domain to a new UPIA. Right? That does not happen automatically. Okay. So you may need to enforce host routes to make the packets reaching the new instead of being forwarded to the pregismal. Also, you you you you intend to influence the Obai network to choose a different UPS than they originally planned. Like, for example, poll, the mobile network choose UPS. They anchored to UPS 1. Right? For example. and you want to influence that decision to anchored to a different UPS. Is that what you do? -- scenarios So first, we started to look at a reactive approach. So if the mobility domain decides the create and assign a new UPF to an existing session of the UAE -- transport network needs to follow. Mhmm. -- that What? Right. Right.
