It only takes a few minutes, or even better if you do a RADA of the, the area where you are being an expert, it might take you 10 minutes to resolve Ararta, and that would be really helpful for everyone. It might also be that you're ending up writing a new draft and become an RFC author. If we find a problem, when we're doing Eratas. And, of course, really, attend all the buffs where you can.

I often get a lot of comments, like, you know, this this group is too big and too important for me to consider doing so. Now it's not the right time.

So So so, Chris, thank you for for mentioning that. I think a a couple of pieces of commentary first, you're exactly right. Not all working groups are the same. Absolutely. That's something that when the the second IDs are kind of making is this is, in fact, not something that we consider. One of the things that you already mentioned that we have largely been largely being committed to. And I think in a in a 70, 30 kind of a way is to do the 11+1 pairing, which is we have an experienced chair and then someone brand new or kind of relatively new. So if you feel like you are in the relatively new kind of category. It is unlikely. I think the tracker hurts us looking back that we never put 2 brand new chairs to run a very contentious group, if nothing else for our own self preservation, be because we will be kinda called in. So we we're always looking to pair someone with kinda similar So we so we'd never put you in that kind of situation. And also it's important to kinda you have come to us and said, I might be interested in kind of sharing in your you're looking kind of what opportunities are kind of available, you know, just because you you come to us and, you know, if there isn't something immediate, we won't necessarily won't think of you in the future.

It's both hard skills of here's some practical advice of what's happened, but it's also turns out to be a great kind Kadre of folks also that are like you that that you really kind of talk about what's really happened in working groups. And so it's very kind of practical feedback, like, that as well. So thank you for kind of bringing that up. Yeah. I I guess, Paul, we're gonna say some you had mentioned that it's useful to, I guess, kinda I think I heard you say it's useful to kinda know kind of what's roughly going on in your working group and be able to dig in technically. That's obviously a helpful thing, but I don't think it's always required. So, for example, I I share mask in the transport area, not consider myself a transport person. I know, like, how bits go from a to b. Generally speaking, But, like, there are other experts in the room. And my my role there was to basically facilitate discussions help move things along not to be like a a networking transport expert. So I think that's also applies to security area, like, obviously, it's good to for someone to know what, like, like, you know, like, Encryption is in general. You don't need to be like a photographer to be like, you know, a security working group. Right. And in fact, on top of that, if you are an implementer, you you maybe even have, like, a conflict of interest very quickly, right, when you're when you're involved in. So having, I've actually shared that is, you know, knowledgeable in general, it it it's also a really good property to have. So so don't be afraid if you're not, like, the most well known expert of that this working group or or protocol, to look to look Bridge."

We walked out of the first, BAF with consensus that we were in doing kind of something around the topic, but we did not have consensus on what that specifically would look like. A good bit of the feedback was around the, coming out of the first box was the the discussion was too narrow. We walked in the second boss with a dramatically expanded charter kind of in my assessment And after conversation during the BAF, there were specific ways in which that much more general charter could have been polished, but we largely felt that in broad strokes, it definitely capture the spirit of what, of what the work on. There was consensus around that. Again, barring those, I believe, 6 particular items. And what's gonna happen next is the charter I believe has had 5 of those six PRs already there.

Invokes encrypt or whatever the or whatever the it's in the specification, sends the ciphertext or whatever pops out the other end to the receiver on the other side who invokes the opposite operation with the private key. The syntax and the way you would use this, should be fairly straightforward. And this simple construction is already found a number of different, ongoing standards, like encrypted client hollow, wherein we take a public key that we fetch from DNS and use it to encrypt a client hello that clients will then send to servers. It's used in MLS to encrypt, all sorts of things that, like, are actually to the group. It's used in OECD or Bolivia's ACP and OTO to encrypt HTTP messages, binary encoded HTTP messages, or binary encoded DNS messages, also included in-depth the distributed aggregation protocol to encrypt values that are sent up to the participants in the multi party computation setting. So It's, I mean, the the construction itself was motivated by, you know, these protocols, like, existing. Like, we needed public key encryption. For TLS encrypted client host specifically. We could have just, like, plucked out, you know, some, standard elliptic curve based thing that was you know, has been implemented. And, you know, had a standard somewhere. I don't remember exactly where, but you know, we we thought, like, why not add yet another standard or whatever as the the good comment goes, but I I I'm in in in you know, jokes aside, I think the the construction that came out of this, is immensely more practical than, you know, past public encryption schemes in particular because it's very easy to slot in post quantum constructions. So we've already deployed post quantum versions of oblivious HTTP. It'll be very easy to deploy post content versions of TLs encrypted client. Hello. Or"

So if you find yourself in need of public key encryption, reach for this. And and using it, you might have to consider asking yourself, a number of questions for example, like, is the public key that I'm encrypting to the right one? Is the the this, like, public key, is it the valid or the correct key for this intended recipient? If you're using it in a setting such as, you know, GTP or oblivious dough. I using the same public key that everyone else is using such that I get the desired privacy properties that I want from this thing. You might also have to answer in a system that uses public encryption, how you actually distribute it. With the IETF. We like to punt on the key distribution problem because key management is hard. And, it's generally application and deployment specific, but So you, I mean, you may have to in in deploying this particular type of thing, think about this rather than like, bake in your public key into a binary. Obviously, that's not the the best solution. So, you know, It public encryption, mentally useful. It is a very small part of a larger solution to a problem. Like, for encrypted client host specifically, because I guess I'm I'm perhaps closest to that one, It is the tiniest, piece of the the the overall complicated protocol. And, if you if you want more information, there is a specification for our 180 that was developed in CFRG. And there are some other, drafts that are floating around to, a extend or add new versions, variance of HPKE, you know, with post content support, different AADs, and blah blah blah stuff.

And then an augmented or asymmetric pick. I forget is the preferred term. But the general idea is, like, one party has the password. The other party does not. And this is, as the the purpose, line suggests, pretty useful if you wanna use that password to establish an authenticated, secure or shared secret. You can use to, for example, bootstrap a secure session, to, like, talk to one another. But you could also use it for lots of other purposes. Like, you could use it to pair devices. This is, this is used all over the industry, the threat and matter standard for IoT connectivity uses a Pake speak to you plus in particular, for device pairing. As I mentioned earlier on, you can use it for end to end encrypted backup. It's what WhatsApp uses. Using a various, a version of opaque And you can as the sort of name of the protocol implies, you can use it for, you know, establishing a secure channel. In fact, there are like variance of TLS at used Pake to authenticate the other endpoint and you know, establish that particular shared secret. There is not yet one for TLS 1.3, but, maybe if someone wanted to do that, they could. The, as before with public key encryption, you know, the the actual cryptography is a small piece. There's lots of other bigger questions you to answer. First one I would encourage you to, you know, ask yourself is whether or not, like, Not using passwords would be a better answer for your problem. So, for example, like, in the web space,"

Maybe that might be a better solution. You might also need to consider whether or not, the case of the asymmetric takes whether both parties need to see the password or somehow to enforce policies on the password. A property of the asymmetric pig, again, is that not bulk parties do not until they see the password. So I'm logging into a server, the server just knows that I possess the password, but doesn't necessarily learn what it is. And other, like, you know, password like authentication and fire arrangements, the server would just be given the password and it would check to see, like, Is this Alice's password? Yes or no? And maybe is Alice's password greater than 8 with, you know, exclamation points and special characters and whatever. But, you know, such such, policies, if you want to enforce them, kinda go out the window with certain types of pikes. Yeah, I guess you need to ask yourself whether or not that's, like, something that you is important for your particular deployment. You should also ask yourself, you know, what is the threat model here and in particular, know, is the attacker who is attempting to, either masquerade is one endpoint or, you know, establish an authenticated connection as if it like, guests correctly, guess the password of, one of the parties. Able to brute force log in attempts, because passwords being low entropy, presumably. That might be an issue. Some paid protocols are not resistant to this particular type of things while others are. And so, choosing the right type of bait for your problem depends on whether or not this particular threat is something you need to concern yourself with. So there are lots of picks out there as well, which is unfortunate, because I guess as an application developer, I imagine it's probably quite confusing choose, you know, which one you want to use.

I should have also mentioned, I mean, I probably should have included links to, like, you know, the the threatened matter stuff and the WhatsApp stuff. There are white papers and, like, standards that exist describe how these higher level systems you know, embed Pikes for their particular solution.

So I I I don't I don't encourage you to start there. Okay. Another, pretty interesting tool is a protocol for, I'm gonna call private aggregation. And the the idea is here is, like, let's say you want to compute a function, an aggregate function say the the sum of, you know, a set of input numbers, in a setting where there's a bunch of, like, call them clients sending you integers or values to over which to compute this input, vaggregate. A private aggregation function will allow you to compute that that aggregate output without the sort of the participants in the protocol ever learning the inputs. So if it's the the sum aggregate, this particular type of protocol allows you to, only compute the aggregate output without revealing the individual values that contribute to it. This, is immensely useful in privacy preserving measurement applications. And, In fact, so useful that there is a, a did not list it here, but there's a working group, PPM specifically chartered to design, specify, and ultimate deliver,"

The people behind Let's encrypt. For offering this type of service. The, I think it kind of 1st hit mainstream and gained popularity in COVID days when, Apple and Google join forces with some others to, use this type of system for computing analytics for, their exposure notification service. And that was particularly impressive given the timeline at which they rolled that out. So hats off to them so, as as always, I think the, you know, the the PPM is actually kind of interesting or the the DAP protocol is kind of interesting in particular because like, oh, it's a huge layer of, like, protocols and cryptography that, if you're gonna implement the whole system from scratch, you have to read and consume and kind of absorb quite a lot. So, you don't need to the purpose of this, you don't need to understand on any of the underlying cryptography. That's really not interesting. Even the debt protocol itself, that's not super interesting from a from, like, a user's perspective, there's a lot of interesting, like, threat model and deployment questions you may want to answer. That perhaps the most obvious one for, a protocol that depends on, like, non collusion for its security and privacy goals are how do you actually ensure non collusion is you know, enforced. Typically what we find is that in practice, like are business arrangements between different entities that are running these aggregator services in the cloud. That is in the case of DAP, the 2 things running these services, but maybe there are other ways that you makes sense for your particular deployment model. You might also ask yourself, like, how the aggregate function, like, actually the offers privacy in a particular way. So for example, if you were, you know, using"

So you know, the the tool itself is only useful insofar as you use it correctly and using, or, like, trying to reason how to use it, correctly is perhaps the the the more interesting piece. And that kind of falls into the last consideration here, which is, like, how are aggregation parameters configured and, and then distributed to people who are gonna participate in this like, what is the minimum batch size, for the the aggregate such that, or the batch size being, like, how many inputs into the aggregate before you actually reveal the aggregate output If the batch size is 1, you're like, not really hiding anything because you're just basically revealing the input. So as an example. And, then you have, the distribution problem, which is very similar to the public key distribution problem in HBKE. You need to know how to, like, kind of in an authenticated and secure way, distribute that such that clients are using the right thing.

And the the basic idea is, like, I want to, you know, ensure that you know, I want to as a as a holder of a resource or someone who might want to do some sort of authorization check. I might want to ask my clients or people who are trying to use this resource. It's proved to me that they have have done something in the past. Like, they've gone through some attest Jack. They saw some CAPTCHA. Whatever it happens to be, they proved to me that they do this with the, a very, like, a single bit effectively. Is a, like, a cryptographic value that, we call a token. It's effectively just a bit that we can check to see whether or not the bit is correct. In privacy best, the protocol for, like, you know, creating that bit in a way that makes sense and, know, relying parties can actually check and this is, has a number of different applications. Like, the the initial idea for this came wildflare on many, many moons ago where the idea was to use this as a signal for, I've already solved the caption in the past. Please go away. Don't ask me again. Also has applications sort of in the new deployment of privacy pass, which is called private access tokens driven by Apple.

And, figuring out what is the signal that you're actually testing to and, you know, implement in, in deploying that in a meaningful way. Is nontrivial, I'll say, and people have concerns about, reasonable concerns you know, what it means to do this sort of, attestation on the web. And, that's a whole lot of the can worms that I'm not gonna open right now or may have just opened it. Another concern, consideration, which is kind of an internal detail, but so maybe probably in hindsight should not have included this, but depending on how you use and hold privacy pass, there may be various attacks that are problematic So, for example, you can use privacy pass in a way where as a client, I can fetch a bunch of, or I can go through a process of obtaining a bunch that I can spend later on. In in a way that doesn't, like, violate my privacy, but this this this property, in fact, can be abused because I can have me and all my friends get a bunch of tokens given to my other friend who then has, like, and a huge collection of tokens and uses them for abusing the service which may or may not be a problem depending on your particular use case. In any case, the architecture draft for, the privacy pass sort of core documents describes you know, how you use this thing, you know, what are various deployment considerations that you take should take into account?

Just, you know, one comment on the previous piece, like Sometimes people use this term unlinkability. Regarding that. So if you read the the privacy past architecture, you'll see that they have a clever, and concise definition of unlikeability, which is really good. If you hear your working group talking about that property, make sure that they're using it, like, either that they're aware of how privacy pass uses it or if they're using it, you know, in the same way or they should be make sure that they're aligned when they can be. That's what I'm trying to say. Alright. So I'm here to talk about, selective disclosure it's another property that you might want to embed, depending on what you're trying to do. And the, you know, the key idea here is usually when you protect information, you end up having to reveal all of the information you protect So in a public key, signature system, you might have a subject identifier, an an attribute like a name with value like Alice, an attribute, like, a date of birth with some some date. And in a selective disclosure scheme, with this 3 party model, you have the ability to, the issuer has the ability to secure that information. Give it to a holder, And with this selective disclosure property, that holder could reveal only part that with integrity of protection, to a verifier. So, for example, if the verifier doesn't need to know my name, but they just need check my date of birth. I can reveal just the information that's necessary to the verifier. And that's really useful when you're trying to build, any support data minimization into your protocol.

And so selective disclosure schemes give you confidence around that the information wasn't changed. You can prove, that the when you just decide to reveal that information in the future that you didn't change and the specific examples of this that you see within ITS far, you know, within the OAuth working group, the selective disclosure, Jason Webbtoken, w three c uses that same technology to provide, you know, selective disclosure on top of their data model, there's various different, organizations building on top of verifiable credentials that take slightly different approaches.

If if And so we came to the wrong conclusion in applying those. Now this turned out to not actually be part of the protocol but it was a sharp edge that we didn't know that was there. Until we were told. And so now the the spec, which is in, which is in RC editor queue now, has lots of glaring warning signs about, hey.

If someone wanted to kind of make that, and I would say we can also carve out a slot, tutorial slot, that, that exists on Sunday, and I appreciate it sometimes hard to attend the tutorial, but the media material is durable to the idea of us having slides we could point out. Yeah. I think I had a curiosity. Do do you have, like, a canonical example you think of of like, material that does, complement an existing standard that is like, written in the way that you're describing? Nick Sullivan. He's over there. - I still have some of his stuff. And so so he has, I like a really nice bug explaining you left the curve crypto. If if if if if automated gifts. And it it It's not kind of a slide deck. It's just a blogging kind of thing, but it works really well. I think that's that's that's a that's what I use as an example. Great. Dudra? Hi, Deudra. Echoing what Chris said earlier, the ideal world is that There is a protocol and a proof and a speck of the protocol, and they're kind of moving together through analysis and specification. Unfortunately, this is not the ideal world. We encountered this with the specification of the threshold signatures in Frost. We had a quite simple scheme in a paper with lovely proofs and follow on proofs from other academics of the general scheme, which gave us assurances that the underlying ideas were sound, But when we actually turned it into a specification, we got a lot of input from a lot of people who are developing schemes in the real world, and it changed a lot not in the fundamentals of its security, but just like what it looks like when you implement it as a thing to deploy in the real world. And it would be lovely to, formally model that something like Timmerin or Proverif or any of these other schemes."

So there's this push and pull between what we would like to do ideally and what we can do and just getting something done. Getting something done securely that people can implement generally securely the first time when they look at it. So there's there's that of, like, is what we ideally like to do, but there's things kind of put pushing us in the way. 2nd, In terms of building on cryptographic primitives, and sort of, assuming that there were security properties of the thing that turned out not to be true, I understand how this can bite you in the foot. The things with the new post quantum, KEMs like Kyber that are coming out are biting us in a couple of places. And the protocols are maybe like HBK saving us from ourselves, but not all of them are. I it it's not easy to say just, like, just look at the security properties. These 4, AK, and distinguished ability, chosen cyber attacks attack, because, because, that is what the Kyber and this team were focusing on when they started changing how Kyber behaved as it turned into mlchem, And their justification was we are only trying provide this particular security property, and none of these other things that may have happened to also be there when we first wrote it down. And several documents and protocols have assumed that they could rely on those properties. And now they can no longer do that if they want to point at the official nis standard of MOCAM. So I I don't like it either. Butts, just to kinda hedge your bets and just be like, if you're trying to implement a primitive into protocol, just be like, this thing says it provides this security property, like, chosen cybertech attack security."

To, like, get support to model the exact thing that you need to model your protocol and yadayadayada.

What type of research should be done before we make substantial changes that impact the protocol or the operational practices that people do around DNS sect. So we wrote up IV together. We submitted a couple of months ago. It's called a research agenda for a post quantum being a sec. It's a little bit unusual to have that site with document with the IRTF Yeah. ETF. So there's 2 requests here. One is, you know, how does the document really like that fit within this organizational structure, and the second request is Where would I we would have a a home for such a document And I guess the 3rd would be the other people feel there should be similar types of documents for other protocols. So That's my comment. So I'll I'll briefly comment on that. But, so so the IRTF, it's exactly the place where to do those kind of things. Right? You you you look at at things at an early stage or do your research, and then you you basically prepare for the time when it comes that we actually have to look at, like, making protocol modifications and how to use those components effort on. So for instance, with the Nasdaq, I think it's a good example because there isn't as as an urgent need with the NSEC because we're talking about relatively short lived signature. So we don't have to run like crazy and implement postcon protection before next week because, you know, we we have the time to do that. We don't have this problem of, encrypting things that are things that are encrypted now might be decrypted 10 years from now. So so even though we have some more time there, it is great that I I read your draft, and it's great that you put all these pointers in. We're like, okay. What are the things that we now have, like, you know, maybe a couple of years of time to"

So in r and l, if you should read this draft, you'll see it's it's not a little bit of research. To really make, to really understand the impact that the different possible paths for this. It's it's years of research and And then my my concern is that, think it, my experience, think you'd adopt and or get into work groups that could get a momentum behind them. And sometimes things and changes are made, before adequate consideration is undone to the impact an alternative. So that's that's all this is basically about. Have we done our homework? And and the second point is on the urgency front. Yes. We we have the National Security Agency in the US is specifying to switch over to post quantum. Fully by 2035, you know, and the US, that means that pretty much Well, everybody's gonna go to post quantum probably by 2035 unless there's switched that schedule just because of the momentum of that. So you start considering the transition time for a protocol like the NSAC being 15 20 years. That that's that's So I I agree. So I agree that those are important points, but, like, for specifically for DNS. Actually, the the the most problems with DNS tech we have will not be the specifics algorithm and morality are good or bad, but can we actually still jury this into the protocol in some weird ways without having all these kind of transport issues and and UDP fragments TCP fallbacks and and Yeah. and or maybe we're just all on quick and it doesn't matter anymore. So There's there's a lot of movement in the DNS space that will happen in the next 10 years. That are much more affecting the DNS"

Again, it needs to be studied because just saying will go to a new transport. Well, that might take 20 years. You know, and I know it sounds easy. I guess you will just do TCP or tilt it. No. It's not that simple. So so so so, again, I agree with your work. I I loved reading drive, it it it made me think, but what we need to do. So it was really good work, and I Please continue this work. But I think right now, the IRTF is actually an excellent location network. Alright. Okay. So where in the IRTF? We'd delegate that to the IRTF people. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your time. Paul? Paul Hoffman. I wanna follow-up on what Deirdre had said before because I think many I think many security working groups are about to hit the same thing she talked about which is thought we could use these post quantum algorithms for these things we and now we can use it for the smaller set and we have to look whether we cross over and things like that. As I'm making a request. In your working groups as you are discovering those things or as you're having those questions, Feel free to bring those questions to P Quip. Because if you're having the question, there's a you know, non zero chance that some other working group is as well. This might turn into a draft in P Quip or whatever of, of covering this, but P Quip is there for on only on post quantum out, but is there for discussion so people discover what other people are discovering. So like I say, if if you know, you're saying, Oh, we thought this would work, but this doesn't. That's a perfectly valid thing to bring to Pequip so other people can notice it as well."

It strikes me that, a, some of my college tutors' warnings about form methods, can be very powerful and can lead you down the wrong hole. Applied, but Also, As we start to look at applying them, to existing protocols. We're gonna find questions like We we're gonna want to rebuild some of our old protocols to make the proofs play it cleaner. Because that's actually one of the biggest uses of formal methods Once you get into modeling stuff, you start to look at things like o. Nots for use, vulnerabilities are bad. They caused Tamaraen to have so many more states that it has to consider And so I think that we may want to go back and revisit some of the path dependencies we've got into over the past few years and be willing to look at things like OCD And, algorithms which don't have those vulnerabilities because yeah. It may be a small thing now, to have your model resolve in 2 hours instead of 2 days. But when you then take that model and build it something else on top and something else on top. Get exponential. So Yep. Yep. We've basically got a new metric"

I think during having that conversation, the specifics is would be the way I had. Chris, you're in the mic. Yeah. So, in the CFRG, one of the things that they do is, really try to emphasize reference code to accompany implementations. Reference code is quite useful. It's used to generate test vectors. It's used to interrupt testing, whatever. And we just heard a talk actually, in the session before this on, some researchers who went out and, like, try to model AADs, some encryption algorithms, the various, like, ways that they can break see how it affects protocols that are using these AEDs. And, I wondered, while he was talking, you know, whether or not we should have, like, reference models for the things that we're also specifying. For example, if you're specifying a bind signature protocol like blindar say or whatever, should you have, like, a a a reference model that, like, others could take and plug into their protocol better that is using that. Because I feel I this is not the first time I've seen people model an AAD. It's I've I've seen other people and lots of different places, reimplement models for TLS, sometimes getting it wrong. And I wonder, if it would be a useful artifact or useful, output of this specification process. Not only emphasize, like, you know, the the the the the reference implementation, the running code itself, but also sort of the you know, this part of the group that goes along with it I I don't know what people think love that.

I I there there's been a long running conversations with, bunch of documents recently on Yang and rethinking what gets kept in kind of, you know, yada, So that's where my head went in terms of No. No. Not that. Well, sorry. No. Because Tamara and and Proverify are, like, the canonical tools that people use to model things. Like, let's use the tools that exist. Yeah. I I wasn't just suggesting Yang. What I was suggesting is that there's been some creativity in using INNA registries to keep files. Death. Alright. Russ Yeah. So, building on what, was just said there. During the lunch session of the RSWG, we were trying to figure out, does everything actually go in Does everything have to go in the RFC? And the answer was no. For example, game catalog, Right? The yang module goes over there. And I And the new SIP files. And Sick files are going away. No. No. Not sick files. Sid files. Right. And so maybe some artifact can be kept, you know, in another place so that when the next guy comes along, or, you know, a better tool is developed for doing these proofs, you know, start the model all over again.
