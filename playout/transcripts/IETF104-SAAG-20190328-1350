    "text": "certificates to actually allow us to deploy hybrid PK eyes might use different algorithms this four can be used for post quantum resistance today or could be just combining two different algorithm for compatibility in general the approach here is but you can combine different algorithm as you as you like basically this can be used for algorithm agility or what called the third ability or agility in the future one of the things that came up in the discussions are is the fact that these certificates and this is a tendency that we see from the FRG for all the the algorithms that you know we\u0027re trying to come up with for next generation we see an increase in key sizes and signatures this besides the idea of combining with traditional crypto is a problem that I would like to bring up to this in the security area and starving may be looking into what is the impact over many other protocols right the most noticeable one is TLS that historically might have problems with big certificates and another point that I was trying to bring out is that it\u0027s not just certificates that will be increased it\u0027s gonna be CR else is gonna be your sis be responsive everything the tendency in cryptography is to have bigger the need for bigger authentication data then it\u0027s smaller and I don\u0027t know if we should bring out the discussion about trying to design systems that will take this in consideration maybe not today but in the near future because I saw that a tendency is well certificates now are small we can make it smaller and smaller and smaller but this is a gift that we got from ECDSA and I don\u0027t think this is going to repeat itself in the future and I really need to plan now my job is to plan today to think in 10 years for deployment and to think in PKI terms in 50 years so I need to start a discussion today and I don\u0027t know and I would like to know what the personal opinion or opinion of the chairs are in this area if they think it\u0027s something that we should start thinking and maybe more formally work on that Thanks I mean I\u0027ll let didn\u0027t speak as well I mean in my opinion certainly that\u0027s something we should were working on I think to make tangible progress and to be able to figure out how to work on it we need to set up what are the constraints so what is the box we\u0027re trying to kind of fit in and then once we have those engineering goals we can figure out how to move out on it and you know whatever whatever that might be help with you know crg or we do kind of something with a new worker but I think we got to know the balance of which we\u0027re trying to create an optimization in or trying to make sure we can fit it yeah I mean I don\u0027t have a crystal ball "
