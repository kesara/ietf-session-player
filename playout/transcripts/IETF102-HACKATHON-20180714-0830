    "text": "hope this is a good introduction to the IETF for you I mean if you have been in like the IETF perhaps this is your first time coming to the hackathon okay a few more that\u0027s good to know and then how many of you are here just for that just for the hackathon but as of now are not planning on attending so we have a few there not just okay well that\u0027s good because I hope that you know I think it\u0027s best if you\u0027re actually able to do both if you\u0027re only doing the hackathon this time great but you know maybe consider joining us for the meeting in the future too I\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be cookies at some point so you know the really the idea here though is that we want to make everything that we do in the IETF go a bit faster or better advance the speed and relevance of the work that we do whether that be working on Internet drafts or if you\u0027re writing the code bringing the two together seems to be a really good way to get the best of both worlds and also to help attract new people so for those of you you know you saw a few hands go up this is their first time at night yep event if you\u0027re working in a team with with those people really to try to help them out because you know a start you may not know where everything is on the wiki how find all the resources that you might need you may not know the right people so help those people out the introduce them to other people and really help them start contributing and being valuable triggers to the idea so everything we do at ITF Center the note well that includes the stuff we\u0027ll be going on the hackathon specifically when we do presentations at the end those are under the rules of the note well now in terms of the code that you\u0027re working on that\u0027s not IETF code necessarily that the rules for that code or or whatever the rules for that code is if you\u0027re working on an open source project there\u0027s probably some license there you\u0027re you\u0027re kind of bound to those rules but but what\u0027s the only part that\u0027s really an IETF contribution are the presentations that you do I\u0027m gonna run through the agenda pretty quick so that you have an idea it\u0027s all posted on the wiki as well so can reference it there we\u0027re doing the kickoff now it is being streamed over over meet echo so there are people who are dissipating remotely we had about 40 people signed up to participate remotely so be aware of those folks they may want to they may ping you and join your teams as well lunch will be brought into the room so you know it\u0027ll be great and good you could stay here continue to work through lunch and have lunch with us as you heard the football match should be coming on pretty shortly - afternoon "
