It's it's fine. It's not the fine, but it's not something we have to reconsider and have to take action. Because t patient is service is not compromised and it's not breaking any assumption in the draft.

Because I have... The next version of the draft fifteen ready to post after this meeting, and I'm happy to take any additions into it they come up during the meeting, but my expectation is probably tomorrow. You'll see draft fifteen that will set have in here what I'm gonna talk about and the intent is this addresses all of the Comments it should go to See editor in three. K. So Eric klein, Internet area Director? Commented on phrase it appears twice once in the agent behavior once in the tam behavior, that says if any local error occurs were the be client. Can't get a message buffer back from the t patient Tam, then here's what you do. And said, okay. Well, do you have if to have a time out there? I don't see any guidance about how to have reasonable time outs what if the thing doesn't on. What do you? And so the text and gold is added to the Github copy ready to go to draft fifteen which says. And by the way, at the hack, we pulled all the and said you have on your code do you have a time on your code. Everybody had the same answer. So we put it into here. Which is note that no time out check is used in the operation Client layer. Anytime it would be handled inside a t agent. Right? Remember the keep h to be client layer is generally un trusted code, and keep asian as trusted code. K. And so rather than the un trusted codes saying, here's my time in case the trusted code doesn't respond. Right? All the implementations just block and assume that the timer is done, if there is one on the inside. K. Most implementations don't the have a timer, Right?

And so that has to do that But the broker level, which is what this document specifies There's no time on in any implementations. We don't know reason to have one. And so we wrote it down in the bold text there. I'm gonna keep going and by the way, all these answers have been responded to the area directors on the email response. So there's nothing that I'm gonna show you that hasn't already been posted back to the original come here. And a number of them have already act that says, yeah, that was fine to me. Alright. We skip on or am my? Who's after okay we go backwards. It was No. We're on the one go back to Eric and then go forward. I think this is the right one. Is eric leonard for this? Think Okay. Yeah. Okay. So number four is sector of you from Stefan, which was then referenced and I think Romans He commented on the words strongly there. We say it's strongly recommended the implementations use Https, and he says, probably don't me strong what you're saying recommended and you referred to the or April first one about other fake norma language like Ought two and so on. And so we just remove the word strongly and so now it has the same sentence without the word strongly in it. No technical meeting change next. So so Roman was there a referenced. Stefan hans is part of his ballot. And here, Roman also commented on the transport document uses this term message buffers. Like, did you get a message buffer back Right? Like, in the text that I was quoting that Eric commented on. And so I can't find the term message buffer anywhere in t protocol or texture. And so I looked to know he's right.

Of thirty nine eighty six provide guidance about der referencing in your eyes. You come on this in section eight, which is the example walk through. Here's an example flow. Right a sends this message, b receives it. Does this and the kind thing. And so I responded saying section eight example is just an example But I did take his guidance enter that into the actual security consideration section then now points to section seven security directions of nine eighty six. And so now there's a... Now there's a reference in there. Transport area view. So here, This one went back and forth with, like two rounds and dairy director, is it a ahead. I'm not sure I pronounce name correctly. Sorry. Suggested the text which is now in the document which is to be secured against now where a deep implementation, is expected to trans a to and a tam might or might not run inside t.

And number two, is not really the job of this document to talk about where you put the tea patient that's in the other documents and and he's and his right. Right?

And so the paragraph from the bottom is literally the text that was prior to last night T one fifteen that we discussed with Of one and fifteen that went out on to to Kirsten and the documentaries we talked about once but it turns out it actually didn't go out to all the art areas so French francesca didn't know that.

Go fast. Alright. Murray comments, duplicate the other ones he just happened to be later in the list here. And so there's nothing new in Murray. All of Murray actually somebody else also had the same comments. So Next? John Sc. There's two scenarios in the document, and he mentioned yeah, That's not the complete list. That the the the text is to motivate why we do agent initiated? And so I put parenthesis among others to say that this is not a complete list in John's looks good to me. That's it on the So the point is as far as I know, All Is comments have been addressed unless anybody else has anything else else, then after the meeting, I will publish I mean, after, probably tomorrow, I'll publish draft fifteen. And then we can take it through the rest of the Isp process. Yep. Any last questions on the graph? This was to confirm, I'm not breaking consensus or whatever. My belief is all of these are just at tutorial now things that we've already discussed all technical stuff last last Even. So I think we're good. Yep. Next presentation. Okay.

Previously, if you have an error in different directions, we had way the agent to send errors to the tam. Site. We had we had errors in one direction, but not other direction. So here, The agent can send an error message to the Tam that says, by the way, your stuff was male for or I couldn't do it because I'm out a memory or whatever it is. Guy. So we had a way to do that. There was nothing in the other direction. There was no way for a tam to tell the agent by the way, you're not your or message correctly or I can't do it now. Try again later or something like that. There's no way to do that. Prior. And so we put that in there, an example of where you actually need this is if you have multiple tam one for different components, like your tam for your firmware, and your tam for your application and the application depends on the later version of the firmware. And so that tam doesn't have thirty update your firmware. Right? And so you gotta be able to send the error message to say, I can't get that because I have to go to my other Tam and he says no. And so how do you even say that? And so now we added exactly the same way of encoding things, area code or a message. We put that into the query response... Into the update message, just so now it's symmetric in both directions that that there's still a common error code space. But the way that you can use an... An sign integer and an error message, you can do that in both directions. So Next. So that that one was... Since those are both optional right. That one is a breaking change, it's an addition that that can be done. So I'll mention the one in a minute that's that's the breaking change Okay. This is the one that Akira mentioned earlier that always called out this threat that we needed to fix is where you have one agent that tries to use different agents at gestation results. Oh, he's healthy. Therefore, I'm gonna use his attest station results claim that I'm healthy, and I'm good. Right?"

And so when we cross post with the rest list, is the one that was the consensus on that email thread and so we put that in there. So since this is not a mandatory claim, this one was a change that implementations have to make k. And so that's what it. Ak akira was presenting at hack at the attack of port. This is those techs that that was experimented with at the heck. So Next. Okay. This is part of that same one. This is just what the security consideration text says.

Next issue, Thomas, correctly pointed out when he looked at the profile define the in the teach back. This is a eat profile, but there's no claims mandatory. That seems really odd. And we said, yeah, you're right. Let's fix that. So now there's actually recurrent another mandatory claims. So the bottom under the new there is there's the required claims? And the additional claims means you're, like conditional mandatory. Right. So the non flame is is mandatory if you negotiate the non freshness mechanism. Right? The recorded claims are regardless of the freshness mechanism. Right? So that's a difference. Mandatory and conditionally mandatory.

Said, we're were gonna think about a little bit more in protection of the document based on the discussion. So I'm just gonna back up what we did. So to refresh your memory, Figure one is the figure that appears in the architecture document. K? And so you can see here The attest stationary result comes back in the ver back to the Tam. Tim can then use that attest station result to decide say, oh, out of policy therefore I to kick off an update message to these remediation because it's a failure as station results. So believe if it's a success result and it comes down to deep agent who can then use it in a past model presented other underlying parties. Right? So in this example here, there's different parties that are consuming the attest gestation results. The Tam is consuming it for purposes of do I need to kick off an update k? And the other line party is using it to make you know, a that say a decision about authorization or whatever. K. So this one comes up to says, okay. So the... Which profile and that top line that comes down for the verified of hand, which profile is it? Is that the t profile, which is what the Tam needs Or is it error for si, which is what the other underlying party might need. Okay. That's what the issue was. K. Next slide. Okay. The document now explains here are three cases. For that question. The first case, and and actually go back for just a second here, because the three cases here have to do with a line that goes between the Tam and the ver. K. The t protocol is the bottom line. The lining in between the Tam and the t agent that's the cheek protocol. So line up top is out of scope for this working group. K. But the three cases that Ham has to be able to deal with, this is whatever other protocol that you're using, don't define that protocol. So he says out whatever that protocol is, it's gonna fit into one or three categories. And then here's what you do as far as the Tam goes. So let's go to the next one. So category one is with an upper protocol that's not deep. Actually has a way of asking the verify to say send me back"

Case two for you might have their protocol that says, okay. I can only give you one But the first mechanism is not non k? And in that particular combination, that means you can take the same evidence Send at one query says here's some evidence give me a for eye. Thank you. Here's the same evidence again, by the way. And please give me profile this time. K. And this works because Nonsense is the only thing that would vary between those two. So you can reuse same one. The other freshest mechanisms of time and Epic Id, can use them within a particular time period and until it's perfectly fine. Right. This says if you're a Tam, have this on the type of protocol. Here's what you can do, no change to the t protocol. Case three is where you... Where you kind look out you'll get unlucky and says, You can only ask for one evidence for profile when one format per evidence but you gotta have a nods. So that means you can't actually the same evidence. You have two different evidence. And so here it says it's actually much better to not use that picture. K?

That's intended to resolve that issue. We think this is consistent with what we talked about my one and fifteen. But this is what we came up with then put into the document so we're presenting it out in case we got wrong Okay. I'm done talking about things that are specific to eat only.

We don't encrypt in the current protocol. Then there's How do you sign evidence k? And then that goes off to the ver, Right? Not the tam of the ver.

And so we already had documentation in there about some of those cases but not all of them. And so The rest of this is about... Okay. That was the overview part. That kinda sets the context for we can be talking about. And we have to have a way to say how do you negotiate banks that that weren't previously specified. So yeah. Next slide, please."

    "text": "Okay. So this the security question is there can be sensitive information that's inside eats and there can be sensitive information inside suit reports and therefore we need to allow those to be encrypted. It's not required. If you have a case, where it's sending, you know, public sensor data from a public device or something like that. You can choose to not encrypted it. Right? But we have to have a way that this define to do it. For for the cases, which we expect is probably most of them with extensive information. And so we said, well, you could encrypt the message themselves, but we kinda already decided to not do that trying to push it down Lend, like cozy level and not message level. You know, the object inside the t message. And so we had to decide what encryption algorithms are managed implement. Only talked about signing algorithms mandatory. Last, fifteen we had a discussion, And so Brendan and Ross and how it all wait in there and you look at the minutes, and it suggests we should probably use an ae algorithm with for example, Ccm. The suit implement mandatory algorithm had Ae with Gc, not Ccm. So he said, well, we either go with the suggestion last one we go to match what's in the suit Mt I And you said, let's match what's in the suit Mt I, which is our affirmative reference. So that was a one goal, but we had to have a way to negotiate them. Right? For Crypto agility. So next slide? Okay. So here's what we put into there. Where we got it right, Or let you judge here? So besides being able to negotiate the t cypher suite for the signature algorithm of deep messages. We put in a way to negotiate eat hyphen suit cipher suites. K? Which is in parallel to the supported deep cyber suite. Okay. Looks very similar. But the fact that we put the each safer sweet in the suit safer suite. And it's out of those five, but what's that we're up there?"

    "text": "One of them is suit. One of them is each, and we said if you're gonna crypto, then we put those into the same negotiation, which means you can't negotiate a different thing for suit as you negotiate for eat. K. If there's a use case that we need to to be different, we can split this. We didn't do that. We said, it's better. If you can minimize the number of algorithms you have in the device, and the complexity of the negotiation, so this seem to be a simpler thing if we don't need the ability for them to be different. K? So right now our proposal is whatever you're using for suit encryption and whatever using for eating encryption, Like how you encrypt suit reports and how do you encrypt eat tokens that come out of the device? Use the same algorithm. K. Allows to to scale down to a constrained device much more much far. And so that's a proposal if we hear. I'm no Okay. then we'll keep going forward with that, but this is the the one question we wanted to make sure we didn't get something wrong. Next, Okay. This is the only know the last slide, but this is the only one where I know that the current draft needs to change. K? Otherwise, there's zero open issues that there are technical open issues. Right? But this one does need change. And that's because the suit Mt I document That we reference We published protocol document sort of midday on the internet drafted deadline. At the last minute, Suit Mt I got posted at the last minute, and it changed so that we don't match anymore. And so what it did, is it replaced hp with Ec h k? And Hp is still a working group item where Ec h is a standard already And so a flipped to be it's not take a dependency on a not published document yet. And so and here, the suit for the protocol says h In there because it was referencing the previous, you know, draft Mara moran suit I. K? So the proposal is Once again match student Mt I make the same change that was made there."

K. So that one is the only known issue that we have to fix and it's an obvious fix. Right? Change age P to Ec and change the text clear up there that mentions Hp and references the c h draft. Right? And see in the first paragraph that's a reference right a draft that will become reference to an Rf. Is Easy d one. So that's the only change that we know that needs to be done to the current draft. Is that it? I I have one more. That's it? Okay. So the hope is unless there's any other issues get raised is that we make the change that I just talked about to make it match To change Hp p And then we believe it's ready for working request call. Because there's no... Oh, issues anybody's raised. So Any questions, any comments on the draft? And and we have multiple we think inter implementations now of the draft. So I think this is the first hack where It's the second hack fund where we've come out of the hack with zero open issues. But as they first hack us on that there have been no additional issues open between the Hack and keep working your meeting. So it... This is the first working group meeting where we can say there are zero and open issues. Other than that's partly because that last one that I showed doesn't have an issue filed on just something that's on the slide. So we know we gotta do that was. There could be an issue now that's so Alright. Thanks. All the issues have been addressed. There so only one issue that we were discussing was the norma dependency you have on several drops and rats and working group, like the one that you just fixed. Right? With these dependencies and these drugs still evolving. Right. How do you see that"

Obviously, we can't have an Rf with an order dependency joint at draft. Right? And so this would get held up until the last norma of dependency. And at least removing the Reference means it's not in the longer block on that one. Right? But it is blocked on things like making sure that goes Rf but since I think the the e one is closer in the process and this is. I... I'm hoping that... It's just starting the process. Okay. So so the only question that we were discussing and you just raise one of the concerns we had is since you have dependencies, what if they change? Right? And so we're definitely gonna do the working group last Yeah. It's a question of call. at which point do we shepherd forward given the level of maturity on an alternative Yeah. So My understanding this each has already had a working request call and that's what I meant by. It it may not be the Yet, but it's already had working a best call. It's already customer publication. Yeah. So as I'm saying this one is at the tail end of any normally all the reference is this one makes our father along in the process. I mean, they've already had working last. Even the Hp one... No. We're removing that reference point. Once we have this, that one goes away. Oh, I misunderstood. Okay. The only known change is to remove any mention of From this document. Then will reference Ec which is already. Okay. And at that point, my belief is All norma reference, our father along in the It etf process. I mean They've already had at least working a last call if not further. Comes the suit leading because there, I think the guy will be starting the working group last call of suit Mt I. I don't think that's happened yet. I think that is something that the chairs would like to do in the suit meeting. I don't know if for us is in the room, but I'm one of the chairs.

You were up next. Yeah. I haven't seen any slides from the hello we haven't push But as the firmware encryption update has any impact on the t protocol draft there I see we have an agenda to discuss the firmware of encryption. Okay. Give this one second. We're we're chatting. Let's It's a norma reference. Alright. Here's the list This a good question. of norma of references that are internet addressed right now. C Hp, that's one that we said we're removed. Okay. Yep. Rats eat, k? We talk about. Reference interaction models is rats. Yeah. And That one hasn't had be Okay.

Yeah. So encryption this is a a presentation at the meeting itself, but that the major change we made was as they've already mentioned was to swapped on Hp based content key distribution this semi static helm that is already in in the post specification. That's quite a a change in in some sense, but as you have seen, there was very slow progress on on Hp and we couldn't I think it's the right decision to to move back and go for less efficient, but more conservative approach. But still the functionality is needed. That I think there's a norma dependency on the from pictures as well as on that suit manifest, And I think also on another document, the custom domains that we really need to pushed the to go forward to a working last call as soon as possible. So I think I don't I don't know whether that would be a possibility to actually resolve that moment. Norma dependency in some other way. But maybe there is."

My belief is it would be straightforward to change that to be informative. I think all but one of the sentences is already clearly informative And so it's actually easy... Meaning, if it matters, Right? We could leave it as is firmware encryption is gonna go just as fast. With this, then that's fine too. But if we need to move it to be informative, I don't see a problem with doing that. Unlike the other ones, would need to be need to stay norma. Right? The suit manifest to reports and suit Mt, although those really have to be norma. The firmware encryption could be done informative if if we needed to. I I I would actually refer that because because I believe there is also this other dependency with the trust domains transformed as well, which also needs to go into was last fall as well depending on how you use the that firmware friction that. In this case, the software encryption But I think that's a case we need to analyze a little bit further. But in any irrespective of that. I think it would make sense to make sure that those documents advanced a little bit faster the in the include to make use of the functionality because clearly the functionalities it's it's important, like, we want to encrypt personalization data.

The other ones I don't think that's possible. And so I think we're rib need to make sure that suit goes do working your last call and, you know, Hundreds direct Trust domains is another one in that category I need to I did not check the language on that one to see if that one's possible to to move to affirmative. I can check that. But but at least Mt I reports and suit manifest, all three of those have to be norma. Ben that's because is actually keep protocol message fields for those. Right? Things that are just done by the suit processor, you can make those be informative because the deep agent code is itself doesn't change suit processor code that does. And that's why you can move them to the informative, if few price so Okay. And all the have to be norma. Right? The only rat draft is the... There's two stretch. There's the... Well, yeah. The red reference interaction models, I don't remember why that one's reference without checking the text if that's for the... It might be for the non part. I don't remember. I have to checked. But certainly, it has to be norma as well as the don't know if we you even reference the media types, but if we do that one could probably go either your way, that's just a justification Yeah. I don't think you do. Yeah. I don't think so. And I'm trying to remember if you you do something with be our foresee. Air is already informative. That's because Keith doesn't care about that.

Right It's in the It's only... Yeah. It's it it's the definition of the non first mechanism. Right? Right so the only way we could make that one not be norma would be the rip out the not stuff and say a mechanism such has and we other thing. And so I'd rather not do that. If we can... I mean my personal thing is I'd rather hold it to get the reference met interaction models. Because it would be some work to be doable, but I I just wouldn't like it. So because now yeah. The problem is Just like for Cipher suites. You gotta something that's mandatory implement. Right now, the only thing that's mandatory from much freshness is the non one, and it depends on reference interaction models for notes? Something when you can make it be normally is to either make something else we manage implement have nothing that's mandatory and that's why I don't like it. I don't like you care those options. After published the reverse truck, we a working group last call. I think for four weeks, I think let's let's go over for week work in the last call. So dave just ping us when you're ready with a new draft and up So Han, we had you down to talk about the firmware encryption, but maybe we don't need to Is that about right? Yeah. I I think so. Because I will bucket the suit meeting about sort of the details on on on the changes regarding the semi study if he hadn't an approach, And and what's in in the document but I I think at least conceptually, from at point of view nothing changed.
