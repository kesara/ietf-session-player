    "text": "parallel exactly Brian Dixon godaddy one other comment just in case just a reminder if anybody\u0027s interested in testing an actual implementation which is way premature but we actually have in our ot environment ADOT setup Oh also one thing that came up before Paul speaks is Brian and I if we do get a lot of good feedback if people start submitting drafts like Stephen says we are we\u0027re totally open to having another intern before Vancouver to sort of chew through some of this in a very focused way so just keep that on I just got a question about clarity I don\u0027t actually care much of what the answer is but I was confused by the intro is this an internal working group document or something we\u0027re trying to like publish with IETF internals okay it\u0027d be adopted working group only just for the we don\u0027t intend to publish it without census exactly well maybe maybe I can go in some other reference pointer it mean it might be good historically to point back to doesn\u0027t doesn\u0027t matter I think it might matter so we should probably wanna be clear about what what do you think though I would rate it a little bit differently if I was trying to get Crosse area review for it right ok all right thanks oh wait this fall off and I just I haven\u0027t gotten to the mic because I\u0027ve been trying to take notes a major major thing that is not covered in this document is name sir zones whose name servers are not all controlled by one one organization so there\u0027s two issues here that again is not covered at all and I don\u0027t I believe that we do have requirements about it from the DNS one is are all NS records considered equal and a very simple case would be a zone that has two NS records one that offers dot and one that does not right so that\u0027s one thing but the other is for organization or for zones where there are many many name servers that are known to be run by wildly different organizations how do we you know like how do we want to handle that and I\u0027ll just say it as one word the route got it so in that scenario it\u0027s like you know you\u0027re the domain owner you\u0027re using you know for different CD ends for a particular zone and so on yeah okay yeah that actually seems like my paper has for what for client policy but um I just wanted to in reference to Patrick\u0027s question um about the state of this document um I\u0027d like call your attention to that November 2016 i HT statement on supporting documents for working groups which strongly suggests the documents like this do not end up being RFC\u0027s okay that\u0027s right and that\u0027s what we yep Brian Dixon one comment about the question about Dame server\u0027s name server names in the NS set I would recommend "
