    "text": "experiments so very basic one and the first one we did was rotating the the interface and the return there is only one interface that is handling all the traffic of the device and we pushed us much traffic as we could and you can see that overall the traffic remain constant events even if sometimes you have a small discontinuity as you can see here when you change the interface interface so you have a drop but quickly you regain your throughputs So based on the performances so it may have some glitches uh when you switch the interface but overall you keep the the connectivity and then we looked at maybe if you want to increase the number of interfaces and you want to spread your traffic across the different interfaces you may have some inefficiency that is introduced by the fact that you have to switch between I mean the hardware interface needs to switch between one virtual interface and the other but you can see here that's uh there are some variations but it's basically not not that big so the impact is very limited um yeah so these are the performances impacts but um you also can have um problems regarding the resources of the network on which you are connected um because you will have much higher consumption of The Logical resources uh we know that's using address organization changing the address having multiple addresses for each device we consume more than uh just having one address per device and this is here uh additionally multiplied by the fact that now a device does not only have one interface but multiple interface so you will multiply the total number of Hardware identifier that will be used so there is a real risk of resources"
