    "text": "all right awesome okay so for those of you who haven\u0027t seen one of these presentations in the past I\u0027m gonna give a really really brief recap this draft addresses these key value mappings that you see almost everywhere on the internet and the problem with a lot of these structures is that they rely on a central point of authority so if you\u0027re trying to send a message to call in over an unencrypted messaging they\u0027re gonna be trusting a key directory to keep that mapping secure and the issue is that the key directories or the DNS providers or the CAS can arbitrarily change the values that they are overseeing and so the core of this draft is to take the common elements from all of these structures and to combine them into a data structure that keeps all of these mappings in one place and then we leverage each of the parties that has a stake in keeping these mappings secure to power an underlying consensus layer that Giuliano and David are going to talk about in a little bit so that\u0027s the basic structure of the draft we take a look at the structure very simply at the top there\u0027s a root key listing for different applications there\u0027s a series of links to different tables with key value mappings and in those in those tables you can these cells that define delegations so for example if I want Berkeley to maintain a set of domain zone files then I\u0027m going to delegate the ability to a key owned by Berkeley to manage this these tables kind of compose themselves recursively until you get down to leaf cells which are value cells where you can actually map to the actual zone file so that\u0027s you know the five-second description of what the draft actually does and now I want to go into some updates ok updates a couple things we change the first is we change the prefix only delegation makes everything kind of simpler in the draft and we notice that for pretty much any scheme that you use for delegation you can always really map it to this system so that\u0027s what we did for example you can just reverse the order of domains to get a nice prefix delegation structure second thing we did is we simplified an update the verification rules so there are more details in the draft itself but essentially if they\u0027re valid time stamps and the fields changed or signed by the parties authorized to change those fields and the cell doesn\u0027t violate the prefix property then it\u0027s a valid update and can be applied third thing we flushed out is a bunch of security considerations so discussions on how the system actually behaves in the face of several types of compromises the nice thing is that because this is based on a consensus layer with a lot of nice security properties those properties bubble up to the actual structure here and finally we introduced the notion of these table allowances this gives a total upper bound on the size of delegation trees recursively where you can just sum the number of leaf cells and the allowances you\u0027ve given to delegations to you know stay underneath that boundary and so this is important I want to talk about this for the rest of the time because for the first time we\u0027ve made a change to the draft that deals with how we govern the structure itself how we decide which entries are "

    "text": "for some transport mishaps this morning okay so I\u0027m gonna update you guys and just kind of a refresher on the stellar consensus protocol draft so if you remember the motivation here is that we think there\u0027s a need for kind of like internet level consensus right so for example say you want to atomically transact across completely incompatible or mutually distrustful systems like I want to pay you money and an exchange I want you to give me a domain name for example or let\u0027s say you want to do with Ron Duke was talking about irrevocably delegate identifiers or rebek ibly for some certain period right then having this kind of internet level consensus where everybody keeps everybody else honest and makes sure everybody obeys the rules is very useful if you want to say verify public disclosure and time stamping of information like let\u0027s say you want to build an IOT device and you\u0027re worried about getting strong-armed into signing compromised a bootloader so what you might want to say is hey my devices will only install boot loaders that have been publicly logged in in some kind of like firmware transparency log right so all of these things are enabled if we have some kind of append-only log whose semantics are enforced by intranet level consensus okay so the model in which we propose to implement this we\u0027re now calling a a slice infrastructure actually Giuliana coined this term so basically a slice infrastructure is a set of nodes each of which selects a set of quorum slices that are sets of other nodes and basically a node should pick a pick corn places that it believes are important enough for large enough to speak for the internet as a whole right and the idea is that we want these things these kind of dependencies to to work transitively so let\u0027s say that I pick Stanford and the ITF is my form slice and you pick you know Baidu we chat and Alibaba is your warm slice and it turns out that you know Alibaba and Stanford both include Google and they\u0027re warm slices so it\u0027s kind of transitively we both depend on Google and so we want the consensus mechanism to make sure that we always stay in sync and never get forked from one another right as long as in this case in this example Google would need to be honest and of course you might want fault tolerance so for fall torrents you would probably pick multiple quorum slices any one of which were acceptable to you so for example you might say four fifths of the fang companies need to sign off on something before you believe that that it\u0027s happened right the Facebook app will Amazon Netflix Google or maybe more realistically these are big companies are probably running multiple servers so maybe you want three-quarters of the servers belong to each of these companies to sign off on things so that if they have downtime for individual servers that\u0027s fine so in this model basically if we let capital V be the set of all nodes and for some node little V we let Q of little V be the set of quorum slices decided by node little V we can define a quorum to be a set of nodes that contains at least one slice "

    "text": "a time after which the system stabilizes and now we have some bound on message delay and clock skew so if we make this assumption and we also assume that nodes fail only by crashing then SCP guarantees safety and also liveness with probability 1 for the intact nodes so what does this mean well SCP is a probabilistic protocol where nodes used a random number generator to make some choices and live with probability one means that as time advances the probability that no intact node externalized value goes to zero ok so this is for a crash top failures only but now if we assume that some nodes may be malicious then things change and in fact SCP does not guarantee life and this is what we\u0027re going to try to fix now there is a third assumption which is in between both that we can make so we can assume that eventually there are some malicious nodes in the system initially there are some malicious nodes in the system but after some point the the good nodes they\u0027re able to detect them and they remove them from their slices so they keep them out of a system basically and in this case SCP still guarantees liveness with probability 1 okay so before delving into this case of malicious nodes I want to say a few things about this intact set so the intact set is a set of nodes for which is possible to guarantee safety and liveness and so in the SCP whitepaper the set I was defined to be intact if after deleting its complement V minus I I became intertwined meaning all its quorum intersect at a good note and also I is on its own in the original system a quorum now so we so we have a new result yeah so we have a new result with a new definition of the intact set which is better than the old one in fact so now I said is intact if after deleting the malicious third ill-behaved nodes the set I is intertwined yeah and also we require that the set I is a quorum on its own so the set B of ill-behaved note may be in fact much smaller than the complement of I and so in this case the new intact set is bigger so this is good because we realize that we can ensure safety and rightness for more notes than we previously thought "

    "text": "and we also conjecture that this is optimal in the sense that no protocol can ensure safety and aliveness for a larger set but you haven\u0027t proved it yet so now let\u0027s go back to liveness and their eventual synchrony when there are some malicious nodes and we\u0027ll start with the simplest case simpler case of crash top notes so eventual synchrony is very nice because it gives you the ability to emulate a synchronous system so here we have a synchronous system with three nodes I know this is a closed system of like a CCP for simplicity and so we can slice time in two synchronous rounds and in each round we know that every node will hear from every other so in such a system it\u0027s very easy to sort consensus we can just ask the node to collect values and then decide on the maximum value the see for example since all the nodes will see exactly the same values they will all agree on what is the maximum growth of consensus and in fact SCP is doing something similar as David said earlier not using the term round but in fact the bout counters in SCP correspond to rounds and the synchronization protocol is trying to emulate a synchronous system like this so this is all fine if we don\u0027t have malicious nodes but now if malicious nodes exist in the system like this node and for here in this figure it does not work in the same way because the malicious node does not have to play well in the synchronous round emulation they can just not follow the wrong structure and send messages whenever they want so here for example we have this node and for that sends a message two and three right before the end of the first round now and three tries to tell the other guys that there\u0027s a new value in the system but his messages don\u0027t make it to the deadline the ends round one and so the notes and one and two boat or drop the message so now in round two and three we\u0027ll start with a different set of values from N 1 and M 2 and so if we use the same rules before we might now disagree so this is a problem that so it\u0027s easy to solve for safety but for hardness is actually tricky and in SCP a note like and four can not cause a safety violation like we see here but it can delay the protocol forever so there are some existing Byzantine voltaren protocols that survive those kinds of attack and so what is the classic solution well it\u0027s to use leaders so a protocol like pbft for example associates a leader to every round and then ask the nodes to not accept any new value unless it\u0027s signed by the leader so in our example of before they would accept and three will not accept the value of n for okay and they also associated eaters round-robin meaning that every round is a different leader and we cycle among all the possible nodes which will ensure that eventually we\u0027ll get a well behaved leader and the system will terminate and produce a decision so can we do the same "
