My name is Carlos Gomez. the right The other chair is shut up on daddy, as you can see, we are both remote today. However, Well, we are happy to say that we have actually now sitting on the table pascagala that will in person delegate and also in person sitting next to him is our responsible ADI client. So we need couple of media takers. Is there anyone who would like to volunteer So remember that it's not necessary to write everything that's being said."

Well, we'll try to handle that by ourselves. any way recall that we are using, as usual, heads doc for taking minutes, So everyone, feel free to join. this collaborative process of taking minutes by means of headstock. So now the link to the minutes is also on the chat. So as in the last few IETF meetings, since the COVID outbreak, there are also some meeting tips Also, for this session, this meeting, for in person participants, Remember, that you need to join the Miteko session for example, from the on-site tool that you can find from the data tracker agenda, Remember that there's a single unified u, which is handled from Miteco Therefore, you need to use Mitako to join the queue. Also, blue sheets are automatically generated Prometechanical So Please do join the session if you are in the room. And then for remote participants, just keep your audio and video off unless you are presenting. this is the not well. This is a reminder of IETF policies, which are in effect on a number of topics which are important such as patents, code of conduct, and so on. So please make sure that you have read it please that being as and this is the agenda proposed for today. So the first presentation is the usual chairs introduction, which currently in progress."

This is path aware semantic addressing for LOLNs. the second one, it's a new individual draft, which is related with the first one. However, it's more generic. It's entitled generic address assignment option for csilopanmd. This will be followed by a set of 2 presentations given by Pascal, The first is on recently adopted draft on ipv6ndprefix registration, And the second one is rather a heads up On 69 working group document, which Pascal is leading. which is entitled architecture framework for ipv6overnonbroadcast access. this document includes some sections which focus on the optimizations and extensions for label discovery that have been developed the 6 low pan and 6 low working groups. and finally, the last presentation is on another new Internet draft. which is entitled transmission of ipv6 package over short range optical wireless communication, and will be given by YongAnuan. So as you can see, in total, there's 80 minutes of allocated time in the agenda. So this is a quite packed agenda, and we'll need to ask kindly ask the presenters and participants to try to to stick to the allocated times hopefully, with some margin for discussion. And other than that, is there maybe any common on the agenda,"

This is rfc9428. actually well, congratulations to the offers and many thanks to everyone who has been involved the process who has contributed with reviews, comments, and so on. This has been quite a journey. and we are happy with the outcome. The outcome So, again, thanks to everyone for the effort. Then the second document is the 6 low use cases draft which is currently in the RFC editor queue in state MC editor. and also publication has been requested fought a draft on IP Six and the multicast address listed as subscription. Perhaps we could take the opportunity to ask our a d, Eric, which would be the plan for the next steps for this document. I think I already changed that status to AD eval. So the next thing to for me to do is the AD evaluation. and then send any comments back after ending necessary revisions, it goes to IETflastcall. So sometime in the next couple of weeks. Although, I think we have four hundred pages on the next double chat, maybe at the end of August, if that's okay. maybe Thank you very much. Okay. And then the 3 of the working group documents are at earlier stages. First one is the Pathawares semantic addressing for LLNs, which is at version 2. and will be presented later today.

I'm going to present the last date of the draft and title transmission of sheet compressed packets over IEEE 802.15 for networks. My author is Ana Minaburo. And just a quick reminder on what we are doing the document. on the left side of the the screen, you can see the traditional 6 loop and based protocol stack of 15.4. Then in this document, the main goal is to offer an alternative to 6 low band header compression, which would be using sheik had a compression. Recall that tick is the main product of the LP 1 working group. which, which which exploit a priority knowledge of header field values of the packets will be transmitted in order to potentially obtain very good compression performance. Also, the document we are specifying what we call the transition protocol stack which still allows to use 6 low band header compression to compress an ipv6 Heathers. and whoever allows to use she had a compression to compress co op UDP headers. On the status of the draft, the document was adopted in January. and and today, I'm presenting version 2, which includes several additions, several updates,"

So this is the table of contents for the draft while there are several dates, rather minor updates throughout the whole document, the main ones, the main updates are the ones highlighted here. So so these are the ones we're going to focus on today. along with a couple of questions I would like to make to the working group. So first, we have the main technical updates in section 43, which is on the point based route over frame format. And the main new additions are appendix a, on header compression examples and appendix b. which provides an analysis of route over multi hub approaches that are defined this document. So starting with the technical updates, they are, again, in the point of based, wrote over frame format, which is the one illustrated on the slide. in the previous version of the draft, the leftmost field wasn't a ship dispatch. However, here, we are requesting a second 601 dispatch type second bit pattern for what we call here the checkpoint dispatch, which is a field that allows to indicate that what comes next is actually, the ship pointer. So the point is that in the previous urgent of the draft, the first bit, of the ship pointer indicated whether there was a pointer actually or not. So by doing this Now if there is a sheik dispatch, after that, any bit can be used. It could be a 0 or a 1, so this does not limit the scope, the amount of rule IDs that can be defined after the sheik dispatch. Also, remember that the ship pointer is a field that will allow to tell a receiver of a decompressed packet"

So there is an update in the checkpoint format itself. the first one on top of the slide is the older one. which started with the period I was mentioning before, which indicated whether the pointer was actually present or not, However, what we are doing in 02 is equivalent to moving this pivot to the last bit of the dispatch. So now the new checkpoint of format is beta line. the first bit is is reserve bit, perhaps it could be useful for future functionality. m, also the address length has a size of 7 beats. so it allows to represent a full 128 bit IT 6 destination address if needed. Then regarding appendix a, this appendix provides header compression examples. There are five sections here. and actually only 3. of them are currently with actual content. These are a one single hop or straightforward route over, which provides an example based on an ipv6gdp coupling packet. Then there's a 3, which provides an example on the point of this route over approach also on the basis of the same ipv6gdp uplinkpacket and a 5 which illustrates this transition protocol stack and it uses an ipv6 UDP coapp upling packets. So as an example,"

This is the kind of content that we have, for example, in a 1. the header compression for the single hub or straightforward route over. On top of the slide, you can see an uncompressed ipv6 UDP. packet, which compresses 55 bytes, including a 7 byte payload. This is the input of the compressor, which in this example, uses rule ID 0x20. and on the right inside of this red retangle is the rule that corresponds to rule ID 0x20, And as a result, we have the sheet compass packet the bottom of the slide, which has a size of 17 bytes including the standby payload and also including the chic dispatch, we just prepended to that. Then regarding appendix b. The point here is that, as you may have seen, in this document, there are currently 3. different route over approaches for multi hub communication. And occasion, there has been a question on whether perhaps might want to reduce. number of such approaches. So with him to clarify things and try to guide a bit in in this kind of question and analysis. appendix b, provides some analysis of present counts and features of the 3 currently defined multiple route over approaches. first one is the straightforward route over approach, This is the one that incurs the lowest header of a head. It's only one bite. However, it pays the penalty. of all nodes, including an intermediate notes, having to store all the rules in use, for compression in the whole network. So would rather be suitable 4 small static networks where perhaps there's not many communication flows."

    "text": "Then the second approach is the tunnel repo based route over approach this one was designed to avoid the issues on the first one so that in this case a node only stores the rules for the communication, it is involved in as an endpoint. So this reduces the memory requirements and the impact of any context, sheet context updates, if any. So it is more scalable with network size However, there's a little bit of a penalty in terms of increased header or the head which comprises 2 parts. bytes plus a very well part. The real part is at least 6 bytes for uplink transmission. and it could be more than that, for example, 12, 16 bytes, or others for the downloading. due to more others, the source routing header. In this case, while this approach requires repull nonstory mode, which may be in place anyway. some scenarios. end, up also for Internet communication, it is that it will require traversing the root node. which might not always be necessarily optimal. Finally, the 3rd approach is the pointer based route of approach. This one also shares the the nice property with the second approach that not only stores the rule the communication it is involved in as an endpoint. So is also reduces memory requirements, impact of any context updates, if any. And this makes the solution is scalable with network size. However, again, the penalty is in terms of somewhat increased header overhead. which comprises two parts 3 bytes plus the variable part. In this case, the variable part is the IPC's destination address compression residue, which could be 0 bytes in very special cases. For example, when there's a full address known before hand, it might be possible to signal that with the Pointer. then it could be"

And then it could be a full address, 16 bytes in communications with external nodes, especially if are several possible destination prefixes. So another future of these approaches that it does not require ripple. and in consequence for inter network communication it is not constrained to traversing a root note. However, it might be constrained to other features of the routing solution use if not triple. So trying to summarize a little bit, The best fits appears to be for small networks, the straightforward approach. for larger networks when we need scalability, then then we may prefer tunneled Ripple based approach for communication with especially several external networks. If if that kind of communication is dominant, and the point based approach if if inter network communication or special cases of external communication are actually dominant. after this, we would go back to the question that I made or we made on the mailing list some days ago. which is okay. there are the 3 existing multi hub route over approaches. Should we keep them? Should we try to reduce the number of such approaches? in the author's opinion, we should try to enable all of them since they are quite complementary, actually. And then the most suitable one can be children for each particular deployment. We've also received some feedback on the list and off the list as well. However, well, would like to take the opportunity to know which would be the ports of the working group on this topic"

Okay. any other common? Okay. Then we can move to the other question. which was also posted on the mailing list. because because on occasion, we've receive some common that perhaps this document, which has been written so far as a 15 or 4 specific document. perhaps should be a generic document. So, currently, it is 15 or 4 specific. as the offers, we believe, that well, this allows a well defined scope and we believe that then it is more straightforward to to create and to write the specification. then perhaps there are some observations or comments here. So if we finally continue with the current scope a a 15 with 4 specific document, may be the basis for other similar documents that might be written after that."

However, if the working group decides follow the generic approach Then addition to the generic based document. There would need to be one technology specific document for each technology of interest. So which would be your thoughts, thoughts, on? Yep. just for your Rotterdam for IMTT Atlantic, just for your information, there is something really new that appears during the Acetan this weekend is that with Pascal, we try to design a chic header that can be also compressed so that can be very, very compact. And maybe one idea is maybe to put the pointer on this indicator. So we have to to see because it's really, really new, but but can be a way to generalize things because we were working on IPSec, and that's why this ID come from. So Maybe there is link between 6 low and the shake over IP. Okay. Thank you. Alice, may I Yeah. Sure. What the compliment what what Laurent just said. So so we as a p one chair now, we we have our group item, actually, to deliver a header and Your document refers to this ticket error that we are committed to to to provide.

And then we expect that it never flies and uncompressed. Right? It would always be compressed, and there will be a default rule set. to decompress it, but that allows to collide. all the fields in the header you do not need. So that gives you a lot of freedom to have in the she cader, some fields that you care about. And so the feedback that we'll need from you as part of this document is is what data would you really like to see, like, this offset. Right? the indicator so we can describe it in our specification And then the technologies that don't use it, they will just compress it to 0. And so that's that's how it's very cool to use shake to comprise that header. That's one thing. Second thing, that was your main question about how generic wants document to be. At the end of the cheek working group when we wrap it up, We want to have described the the various use cases that we can have, 15 5 effectively is a use case in a wider mesh, type of of network. So we expect to have the wider documented somewhere, and how it's documented will be probably part in the architecture what is very, very generic, like presenting. You can do a tunnel between a and b, or you can do a compression, decompression at every heart. there there needs to be some text about that in the architecture. So in the end, that will we'll have to extract it from your doc, and you will have to point on the architecture document for this sort day. Okay. Thank you very much. I have a question for Pascal. get you on the record saying that there's no conflict between this document and work that Shake is doing. sheet sheet. Yeah.

So it's not AF anymore, but it's a TIF. So tree allocation function. Okay? And we group at all the the text status, as I said, And, obviously, if we change this this this small acronym, let's say, we have to rewrite a little bit here and there, the document In In this section, we also put the text that discusses what happens if we have different elevation function. Because if we have a different allocation function, then the way you rebuild the full IPV 6 address starting from from what you have in your allocation function may differ. Okay? So there is text about this consideration. and, as I said, the alternative allocation function. The main myth is about security. Okay. We did write a more extensive section, I mean, it's not huge anyway.

What can happen is if there is a malicious node, can leverage on on this knowledge personating different nodes and continuously asking for a new IP address, and basically exhausting the the number of addresses that are available. Okay? yeah, this is this is a feasible attack. I mean, the only way around is be careful of who is in your network. I mean, and Otherwise, this is up risk, a risk, which is now documented. The other point was in the privacy considerations, The first consideration is if you build the address algorithmically this may reveal topology information, or you let's say, you can Reders engineer at the algorithm looking at the address, you can understand thinks about the topology. This is especially true in the to the allocation function. Okay? Be gone because in the way we build diuresis, you you know how Datapology And you have an example here in the slide if you have a an address that terminates with 2b. okay, so the the the first part, obviously, is the prefix. We don't care about it, but 2b is the binary for 101011. Okay? Now With the tree allocation function, the trailing one bit, indicates this is a host Okay?

So this is a privacy concern. Now it depends on deployment whether or not this is an issue to you. If it's not, nothing to worry about is if it is private deployment, for example. If not, then you you certainly need to deploy something in order hide your topology one possibility is to use something like Nat 66. k. Eric is not in agreement. Don't don't don't. It's not a must.

That's the only small trick. which means that basically what we have now is a generic procedure that when a nodes comes up, we can you can send a naval solicitation with the Galop option. receive the neighbor advertisement with telling I propose you this address, and then you use you use existing machinery without any change in order to register the the the address of your choice. okay, which is in line with the other specification about the prefix and multicast registration. and Yeah. You you can still signal this capability in the capability indication option if if we we go with this solution Pasa doesn't meet this pit anymore, so we can use it in this document as a real generic solution. that's it. and 2. Any question? or the mailing list. I I have No. Yes. Yes. I I really like the the procedure here. I really like the the idea of defining a different option for this, and I just don't believe that you need to keep aligned to yellow. It will ER will change anyway. So being aligned at one point of time is not the an objective. Just It seems to be more trouble to you than than than help.

So it started with 65 6775, which was abated by 8545. 8545 updates, but does not reply 6775. So you're reading the 2 of them. And so that gave us, basically, the capability to register 1 address. Then we add 88928, which allowed us and that we will come back to that. But it allows us to Guarantee the ownership of the registration if the the request, which wants to register this address later, appear somewhere else, there is a way to ensure cryptographically that is the actual owner of that address. So that avoids all the heavy issues of injecting addresses or getting trough for an address that you do not bone bone, bone, bone, Then we we we work on we said, a, can register global anticancerosis, blah blah blah. That's very nice. But why don't we do the same thing for multicast? If for instance, the ripple protocol can carry multicast and unicast addresses, So why not use the same registration over ND to replace kind of MLD. Right?

But let's say it's a router, We've got this some entity that that delegates somehow a prefix to that to that router. And the different ways could be, yes, the usual dhtppd, that's one. could autocomp for ULA prefix by doing some random computation. That's 2 or there could be something like an EPAM, you know, in a cloud environment that would basically say, hey, you've got this prefix. either way, we've got the problem that between this entity and the and the the data, which gets the prefix, well, we have an understanding that this Rotter can use this prefix, but all the routers the other routers in this network.

We use the same protocol and the in the middle to two connect one with the other. And if you look at it from most solutions we have, do some prefix delegation, we are missing that link. are you talk about 6 v 626 slash 64 to the host, or you're you're looking at snack, etcetera.

We want to ensure that there is unique allocation, If if the prefix is uniquely owned by a a a router, and we want to ensure that is truly the owner.

I mean, the the idea is to use exactly what we do for addresses that is first come our serve, Now if there is an external entity that delivered the prefix Then we tie that to 8928, so that there is a key pair associated to the ownership that KPI must be given to the host at the same well, the latter, at the same time as the prefix. So now he has the ownership. The white happens has to be defined protocol by protocol. For instance, with The node could provide this public key to the DHCP server and the DHCP server would write somewhere that effectively that public is associated with address that it will give back that goes and under the 8 9 to 8 process work. just for a prefix. So that's one way of doing it. just as an example. So we can secure effectively at least in some cases when we are visibility on the iPad of the day, we can secure the ownership. We can trust it. And that if, otherwise, discussion with whichever EPAN that is or THCP, we might like that right, which is the cost. Next slide. they I have to move to the other steps. So yet. point is you also mentioned the p field with G. So the p field is 2 bits, and we made it fear that's supposed to be a bit because that allows us to have more value than just one beton, one betons. we add 0 was unicast, 1 was anycast, 2 was multicast. Well, the bit for 1 was anycast, the bit for 2 was multicast. but they are kind of which are exclusive. So let's make it p field of 3 bits, and now we can indicate that we register prefix as well.

It's just that we have not accepted No. But what you're doing is you're taking this thing that applies to me, like, maybe millions of nodes on factory floors or And you're saying that the billions of devices on the rest of the entire Internet need to adapt because this other reality has changed. I'm not saying that it was Lauren's question this morning. I'm not I don't aim to replace Slack. This has an applicability nothing to do with Slack. You're you're taking you're saying that this model over here is is -- It's one possible deployment model. Therefore, we need to redo the entire interface l 2andl3. multi you're redoing the multi link subnet This You don't user has to deploy this everywhere. Right? you can still keep your home gateway the way it is and and not change and the host will keep acting as they do. That's the current state of affairs with 6 Low versus sort of standard b 6. But even if if my own gateway well, does not support this, for instance, and does not place the bet in the 6 CIO. and my Linux PC supports it, since my gateway does not support it, the line HPC will operate as before. And and then there are there is a 9 to 9, which allows to to basically proxy from one side to the other, even if they're on the same lane, by the way. so there is all the compatibility specs that are already there like interop same length, same physical"

We are still redefining the mapping of L2 over, That's 3 of items. That's no small thing. not. It's a new architecture document. I I understand that might be too big for 6 man. Don't know. And because it's more than maintenance. I agree. We could we could decide to form a working group around this. Yeah. You could try to have a BAF and Charter working group for this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we are a little bit behind schedule, but still Michael had a comment maybe. Is it working? Yeah. So I don't think we're redesigning the the interface from L2andl3. I think that l 2 never actually announced any kind of an inner face and that we have essentially 30 years of L2 Trex while we try to continue to pretend it's a big yellow cable, And They just pulled the wool over our eyes for 30 years. So say we're redesigning the interface is to say assume that you knew what the interface was in the first place. and that was just wrong. we we Maybe I should say redesigning the assumptions about the interface. I would say just writing down the assumptions about the interface. because I don't think they're even written down anywhere."

That's that's the one thing that it can shirt. And it's it's says, yes. We we did it on purpose. And probably the purpose was that before to visit would be easy. Well, it proved not to be even with that assumption, But now that assumption is killing us. It's like Michael said, we are we keep keep keep masking and masking and masking that the real world is not like that, and the cost is getting heavier and heavier and heavier. Okay. Thank you. So yeah, we should probably continue with the next slot. So thanks a lot, Pascal, and thanks everyone for the discussions will definitely follow the discussion of the work.

The presentation today has been quite about the bigger picture, the applicability the technology However, the draft itself contains already quite some technical content. So please any feedback on that will be very much welcome. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. So any other common requesting Please. we are 1 minute behind schedule. so on. Okay. Then these ends the session, the 6 hour session today, So many thanks, everyone. We hope we can continue all these discussions on the list.
