    "text": "did come through this working group originally that\u0027s why we\u0027re suggesting that this document come to the working group as well we did 77060 a while ago as you can tell because we\u0027re already on our FC 8400 something and there\u0027s now a bunch of more implementations so that\u0027s good we would like to document some of how the implementations happen is such like that many people who have implemented 7706 didn\u0027t implement 7706 Wes and and others and they\u0027ve been saying 7706 like so instead of saying 7706 like because that has a lot of parameters we can either document them and say where there\u0027s a delta but actually many of them really did take the spirit of 7706 so we might actually update 7706 to be more inclusive for most of those and we can still document the ones which didn\u0027t adopt it exactly right and say and such and such you know as an implementation thing didn\u0027t do what is now being described but is close this way and the developer can even say why but we do need to stay focused on the goal which is that the the root zone that you are being authoritative for can only be seen by things on the host in 7706 that we said it had to be running on the local host that turned out there were implementations that didn\u0027t do that but they made it so that only the host could see it so we are going to expand 7706 a little bit while still holding to the thing that the working group had agreed to for 7706 which is if you are hosting the root zone yourself and you\u0027re not a one of the magic 12 you you know to follow this you must be doing the way where no one else can see it so what we\u0027re doing we have a draft K and H he\u0027s K I\u0027m H and we want to keep this so 7706 was informational we want to keep it informational this is sort of operational this is I mean some protocol II things and there\u0027s certainly some RFC 2119 language but in fact we are not suggesting that this is a standard so keeping keeping it informational again we\u0027re hoping that the working group adopts it because that if not it\u0027s going to get really tricky because Warren has to find some other ad - sponsoring but also for those of you who are around a few years ago you\u0027ll remember there was a lot of really good discussion for 7706 on the mailing list it wasn\u0027t just - oh yeah this is fine we really did have some good theoretical discussions of why are we doing this is this bad and such and with us possibly expanding the scope a bit it would be good to have the same but not the same "

    "text": "discussions to have the same people being very interested thank you Andrew so how we\u0027re doing it we\u0027ve already put out the o1 draft so we updated the requirements from marine route server must be a local host which some of the people weren\u0027t following anyways they were being 7706 like and we said the current wording as root servers must only be available to resolvers on the same host so that is an actual expansion and people may or may not like that what\u0027s if people do like it one of the things we absolutely want to do is update the examples there\u0027s a couple examples in the appendices there\u0027s now more implementations that we should be talking about and we can sort of do it as examples implementation reports and such like that so with new ones that would be it and I believe yeah that was my last slide hey so let\u0027s go play imagine imagine I were hunting a server on the host and I do this magic trick mm-hm and then I\u0027m multi honed I\u0027ve got two IPS and on another IP that I\u0027m not banned on 53 from a forwarding only resolver that forwards to this one my breaking the rules because that other resolver it\u0027s an open resolver and I\u0027m serving the world but all my queries go to the other one on the same host could be my break in the rules that\u0027s a that is a question for the doctor so um I would hope that the answer is is is not that you\u0027re breaking the rules but don\u0027t allow that really sorry uh but what if I had three IPS and the one down the road asked questions the one locally which asks the questions the one bound on the host so we\u0027ll don\u0027t apologize that sounds fine we can talk about that in the doc are you saying that we shouldn\u0027t do this because that might happen I don\u0027t know hunter essential where I\u0027m going with this but it feels like you\u0027re trying to constrain a moment that is more observed in the breach than the observance it feels to me like you can\u0027t really apply the constraint you can wish for it wishing and hoping and dreaming it\u0027s not change Shanker so one thing that I think that\u0027s happened in the interim since this was published is the aggressive and set caching which I think reduces the the temptation to set up such a server so why because I\u0027m hearing a couple people here have the same question because all of your all of your cast wishes will be answered negatively by your local resolver without having to go after you\u0027ve asked all at this point thousand and twenty five however many ask questions Wow well but but again 70 is one of the reasons for 7706 at all was to preserve privacy you know it\u0027s not it\u0027s not really it\u0027s not to protect "
