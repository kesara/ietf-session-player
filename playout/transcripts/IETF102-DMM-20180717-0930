Roman architecture now has been added to the draft you\u0027re considering the roaming architecture as well and how these protocols basically behave in terms of roaming support for different mobility protocols within the operator networks and then slicing for example that\u0027s another consideration we have made in the new division again the data player architecture model for m9 because the study all right and this is a very important they study item that cc4 issued is is only applicable to the n9 interface the interface between the UPF "

    "text": "of the slide from a paper at NS di a few years ago that proposed to use data plan mechanisms to ensure connectivity and they proposed this to low the latency to contact the control plane and to be more efficient in restaurant connectivity they propose it for link failures we proposed it for mobility and our scheme is doing lightweight but very process what is important in our scheme is that both forward and mobility operations actually based on ideas or names in the case of hybridization we have no interaction with the control plane no mapping to contact or date and no new note to deploy a provision to manage mobility so it should remove most of the challenges in operating mobility so I won\u0027t describe much more but the key aspects to remember is that this scheme is fully on Karla\u0027s and that mobility is under layer 3 which makes it very convenient for hydrologic network supports in the draft you will find pointers to some documents supporting the performance of the scheme for scaling or for performance plus some optimization we do for latency sensitive traffic in the rest of the presentation I will illustrate some of the benefits in the context of deployments which is the object of the second draft we proposed and we focused mainly on the 3gpp architecture so I won\u0027t go into detail for free DDP but just illustrate how we benefit from regulation in this context so so Jordan me it should be wrapping it up a little bit short sorry so the first benefits they originate from the use of Oracle\u0027s to play pattern and it\u0027s simply the matter of ratio in interest and at the same time it\u0027s sufficient for you to load balance you request on many accesses to benefit from a native multihoming ability passed the second benefits are originating from the use of intermediate caches in pass from the rooters and this allows low latency and native mythical sting of the request because ruto is able to answer on behalf of a consumer the second types of benefits originate from the native vocalist properties of the skin and we obtained this when we use for example in 3gpp haan on in place of the gtp tunnels and this allows on Karla\u0027s mobility and offloading of each communication at the edge of the network so I want to tell that so of course both benefits from HIC NM for the use of ID base the mobility can be combined what we propose we have discussion in the draft about partial insertion so it is where we can have ID even a subset of nodes or use as a v6 in between each ACN to extend the reach of the proposal will require chastening endpoints but we try to make the insertion really minimal through easy to use implementation and non HSN traffic can also benefit from the mobility pattern based on IDs so to complete I would say that we have proposed a new paradigm based the purely on identifier we bid on Abaddon "
