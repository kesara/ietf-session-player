We'll talk a little bit later about getting in the queue, but you will see the the microphone you'll put yourself on the queue and then you can go to the microphone. With that, I am Karen o don. I've a long time participant in the It. I've shared a number of working groups. Sa on the Ia, and I also have been working with the directorate for a while working on newcomers activities in various outreach activities.

Michelle Cotton, who's also been around the For a long time and is now. Helping to shepherd our new participants program into a better and more sustainable place. So with that, we'll go ahead and get started. So This is an overview of what we're gonna be talking about today, and we're gonna give quick overview of the F. In general, and then we're gonna talk about what a Ig ihs meeting week looks like. We talk about some of the resources that you have and some of the new participant activities. Next slide. So this is really not the complete history of the, it's not everything that you need to know. It's really a place to give you a starting point. Give you some of the information that you need to get started. And you give you an idea of where everything is and so that you can sort of leap in in your first few meetings. This We'll also provide some links and some resources that you'll wanna pay attention to. It talks a little bit about the structure of the And the leadership and things like that. I've already said, it does not include how to write a standard, how to bring new work to the It etf. You know, how to... The history of the all of that material is available in other sources, but not here today. Next slide. We talk first of all a little bit about housekeeping. And the first one here is the note well. Now you're gonna see this all week and you will when you register for the meeting, you will have clicked on it. The Is all of the rules in the process is that we abide by at the meetings. So We start every session. An It is a reminder that you are in an official Session. And all of these rules apply."

What the Internet standards process is, the code of conduct and our anti harassment procedures. If you have any questions about any of these, feel free to talk anybody at the Ihs, any anybody in leadership. Michelle a little bit later on we'll talk to you about the structure of the badge and what the color dots made and that way can sort of identify people from that, you know, from across the room. See I have a blue dot on. That means I'm a working group chair. And the the colored dots tell you all of the various leadership positions. The next thing and this becomes this is very important. We used to have manual blue sheets and that was how we track attendance at the Etf. We are an open standards group. So we we do need to document the fact that we have people in the room and that they're participating in the process. But now we do all of that electronically in every room that you into, you'll see one of these Qr codes. And if you scan that qr code, it'll automatically mark your attendance for that meeting. So and there's a A lite app that basically does that for you. So for those of you who haven't done it yet, thumbs up. Scan the code. If you are unable to scan it, and have any issues at the end of the meeting, some folks will be standing by it to help you. Just to show you how to do that. Alright. Next administrative item. So that gets to the how to ask questions, which I alluded to earlier. We do have It takes remote participation very seriously. And we try to... Even the playing field as much we can between the people that are in the room and the people that are remote."

Or Michelle if he can hop into the queue. So if you have the Mid echo light app, then you can either use the full version of Or the light version, and you can put yourself in the queue. And then when your time comes walk up to the microphone. And that way, you know, some of these people will be in person and some people will be remote. But that's how you get in the queue. That's you ask questions, and that's the process that be used all week. When you get to the microphone, we're doing an experiment this time, we're we're they're doing some closed captioning? So it's very important that when you get in the line that you announce that you give your name because that's how the the captioning is going to to help get that. So when you get... You know, you get up to the microphone, state your name, ask your question. So I think that's all the basic process, like, how to get started. Oh, now I did forget the Covid guidelines. We are still The It did an extensive community consultation about our processes regarding Covid, and we are following what has been documented. You agreed to that when you signed up for the meeting. As we all know, it's been a challenging few years and the rules keep changing. So at this point, our policy is if you're in the meeting room, you need to be wearing your masks unless you're at the front of the speaking. They do have some tests available. And if you're out there eating food or whatever we ask that you keep your masks on whenever possible. So that's it with that. There's also a set of pins and I don't... I don't have one this time.

And if somebody is wearing a red, tag. That means that I I really like for you to maintain your distance and and in respect to the fact that I want some some space. So those those sets to pins, you'll see a lot of other pins there's pins that say ask me a question, there's pins that might say asked me about my boss. There's also a set of pins that say, if you speak another language, and you would like to know, identify you know, to somebody that, you know, identified a people that you speak that language, You can get a pen that says that. So the. Final thing I will say, and I don't think this is anywhere else, but I see a few people in the room with them. Have noted we have two colors of lanyard. We have white lanyard and red lanyard. The red lanyard are for people that would prefer not to be photographed. There's absolutely... There's in in group shots, there's no guarantee, you know, but they're not gonna do a close of view. With your red lanyard you're not. So if you would prefer to not be photographed, Please wear a red lanyard. We have our photographer right here, taking a group shot. So with that, the section I'm gonna do is the overview of the Ihs. Next slide. So the mission of the Etf is to make the to make the Internet work better by producing high quality relevant technical documents that influence the white people design use and manage the Internet. And this is as documented in Rsa thirty nine thirty five. Next slide. The Ihs operates as an open standards organization. With the concept that anybody can participate.

This is tool that we use to manage all of our documents. And it it as you get more involved in the It that's that's gonna be your key portal into what's actually going on. So any Rf that's ever been published is available. And all of the drafts that lead to the current work are available. Mailing lists. Also have public discussions and those kinds of things. Contributions to the I jeff are judged on technical merit. And not on we we strive not to be influenced too heavily by policies or, you know, government you know, governments or companies or that kind of thing it's what is the technical solution that we're looking for to meet our needs? And finally, we measure the success of our standards by them being deployed. We we don't have any authority to acquire deployment and use of these standards. Some, you know, other external people might choose to require them, but our our point of of success is voluntary deployment. Okay. So I've I've highlighted on on a bunch of this, but this is standards development organization. Some of you may have participated in other standards development organizations like the It or the Etf or, you know, some of the cons consortium that that develop standards. There's no formal of membership. It's a self selected participants. So you don't have voting rights, you don't have to pay a membership fee. It's an open membership type... There's no membership.

You look at W and Oasis and the organizations that focus on application type stuff. The Atf is focused on the Internet, the core of the Internet.

So this is the big picture. There's... You're gonna hear a lot of acronyms and I you know, some... I tried not use and myself, but I I already have fallen into it. This morning as I'm speaking to you all. You'll see this a couple different ways, but the Internet engineering steering group is the primary leadership body of the F for all of the work that's being gone. So if you look at the blue, you have working groups and working groups are organized into areas. So if you're interested in security, all of these working groups will be in an area. And then each of these areas has two maybe three leaders that help coordinate the work of that specific area. All of those area of directors form a body called the Internet Engineering Steering Group. Next to that is the Irs. So we have an I f, which is the Internet research task force. And it has a number of research groups and Irs is the group is the body that helps manage the work of the I f. If you're looking at the agenda when you come in here, there will be"

Generally, the research groups have work that's either further out or its work that is something like the human rights protocol recall considerations research group. It's not specifically protocol related. There's also the Internet architecture board. So they provide oversight. They also do a lot of our external liaison liaison. So discussions between, like the Ihs and the It or, and I. That is facilitated by the Ia. And then finally, there is the administrative Llc. And the Llc is basically the group that signs the contracts pace the bills you know, make keeps us on the legal. Straight era. So it's the corporate home of the. There's a couple other entities on there that are that are adjacent to the It they're important. The Rf editor is the organization that publishes all of our documents. very And Ian is the organization that manages all of our protocol numbers. So if you're working on a standard and you have to assign, you know, port Ids or something like that. Ian keeps track of all of that for us. So that's the big picture. Next. So here are the areas that we currently have in the It. I mentioned that working groups organized into areas. So we have at this point, seven areas, these sort these change over time, depending on what the current needs are, but we have an applications in real time area. Working on things like Sip protocols and web web Rt and those kinds of things. Have a transport area. So if you think Tcp, Udp and quick. We have a routing area. Does all of the routing protocols. That's one of the busiest areas in the It etf. Who actually has three area directors."

Also one year and dear to my heart, if you're into time synchronization, the network time protocols working group is in this area. Then there's an operations in management. So this does both the yang net comp side of the house and then it also does like operations. So a lot of times, like, the v six, for example, there there there's a v six ops working group, which is about you know, V six operations, and that's in the operations area. There's the security area, which is also quite large and has a number of working groups in it. And it deals with all the security area protocols and mechanisms. And finally, there is a general area. So the general area is basically activities that are focused on you know, supporting and updating It ihs processes. So, you know, we have a set of rules that we work by. Those rules are documented in Rf. If we need to update those for any reason or if we wanna have a discussion about potentially updating them. That kind of work falls into the general area. So I've alluded to this a little bit, and you'll see a little bit more detail later on. But the... The leadership structure among the three main groups that you would interact with is on the Ihs side, there's one Etf chair. And Lars E at the moment. And he's also double headed as a general area director. General area, general area, area director. Then each of those areas has area directors.

When you go to the data track or one of the things that you can see on each working group on the about page, you know, in addition to its charter and it's milestones, you will also see who the working group chairs are for that working group. On the Ia side of the house, the Ib has the list of members which are selected each year. And then the that group that body selects the Ia chair. So the Ie etf chair and the area directors and the Ia members are all chosen by this non comp process we can talk more about at another date. The Ia chair is actually elected from the I members this morning they had the election of the Iv beach chair for the for the next year. The Ir f chair is appointed by the Ia b. And then the Irs is selected from the chairs of the various research groups. So that's that's the leadership body that we have. So now I'm gonna talk a little bit about And consensus. I'm sort of whipping right through this and talking fast if if you have any questions, you can stop me or you can wait till the end. So So the on It ihs and consensus, the Of mantra is we reject King's presidents in voting, we believe in rough consensus and running code. And what this means is we don't have a formal voting process. We don't have a formal veto process. We, you know, we we achieve rough consensus and then we move forward. So it and it's Rough consensus is when all the issues have been addressed they may not necessarily have been accommodated. The working group may decide not to do something that you know, somebody is asking. But it it's a measure that enough people believe that it's ready to move forward. So"

My I haven't talked about humming yet. Oh, gotta to talk about humming. One of the things... One of the ways that we do measure, consensus is is humming. And part of the reason for that is that humming allows us to take a measure of both the volume, the number of people that are in support of something versus the number of people that are and how passionately they feel about it. So if somebody asked the question, you know, do you support adopting this document? And you softly. You're like, yeah, you know, I I would wouldn't oppose it. I'm not necessarily crazy about it versus, you know, you hung loudly, and you really care about it. Session chairs. So in this particular instance, Rich and Michelle and I if we were to do ask a question, and, we would determine amongst us what we believe to be the outcome of the. And there's a whole lot on this because This is what we do in the rs in the As we write Our c's about things, including how we in the T. Next slide. Alright. So I'm imagining that what most of you are here to do is to participate in working groups. So Take you back to the fact that the the data tracker has all of the information about all of chartered working groups in the It etf. If you look at the date of tracker page for particular working group. You can see the first tab would be the about tab, and that's gonna give you the name, the mailing list, any additional resources, like"

If you go across the left, there, you'll see it also has, like the documents and the meetings, the history, and that kind of thing. And at the very end, you had the list archive, which is the archive for the mailing list for the working group. So if you're interested in participating, start by looking at the data tracker page for that working group. Look at what the charter and the milestones are for it. Then the next step would would potentially be to join the mailing list for that working group. And you know, look at the documents that are currently in process know, some working groups here are just starting out. And so, you know, that you have new work that's just the beginning. Other working groups are you know, really far along on their processes. And so they are you, they're already at the stage of of detailed comments and they might have had several revisions over the last year two. If you have any questions about the working group you feel free to contact the chairs. I think there's a There's even a button somewhere that basically says email the chairs of this working group. So next slide. So the next thing I'll go to is how new works starts in the Because that's another thing that often brings new participants to the Id ihs is you know, you want to improve something or bring new work in. This is also a with the rest of the, it's basically based on contributions. It's a bottom up process. So The Is not an organization that you can come to and say, I see this problem, and I think you should solve that problem. What you do is you come and you say I see this problem. And here's a possible solution for this problem. Does anybody agree with me or disagreement with me or whatever. And So that... That's the first step is, you know, people identifying things that need to be solved."

I must not be going fast enough today. So does this problem fit into one of the It ihs areas? And Also, does it align with the architectural principles of the Ihs? If you if you bring a technology here that's basically breaking the basic model of the Internet, end end connectivity model of the Internet, then that's probably not going to be accepted as new work. Is the work well defined and is it well scoped? Is it engineering work versus research work? If it's engineering work, it's ready for the Idea. If it's research work, then perhaps it's something that would be done in the I f instead. And finally, are there willing people to do the work? Because again, it is contribution driven, we don't have the people to do the work then we can't complete it. Next slide. So this is a little bit better. A different way of looking at bringing new work to the Ihs as well. And some sort of some hints as to how to be successful at it. So the first one is to to find some, you know, find collaborative collaborators here that have similar interests. And see if you can find out a group of people that you can work with to bring it forward. You know, across multiple companies across multiple universities universities, you know, you need to get a few people that buy into to your good idea. And then you need to write some initial internet drafts, possibly have a barber off. And a barb is just a really a side meeting somewhere where you you know, gather that set of people together that you think might eventually support this work. Then you can talk to the area directors in the relevant area. So if you have, you know, a new feature that you think should be added to Ip six.

You can hold the bath But there is a a set of slides in a tutorial that's pretty good that's looking at bringing new work into the It ihs. Needs to be updated a little bit, but it's not too bad. So I would check that out for bringing new work to the Ihs. And the funding model for the. This is the question. This is the slide we added. Last time and the time before because this question comes up a lot. So the relies on support from a lot of different places. It to make sure that it is open and accessible available everybody.

And for more information, there's a link there that gives you you can get if you are interested in helping support the work of the I ihs going forward, Next slide? So, finally a little bit on depends and culture. You know, it is a... It's a culture in addition to an organization. It's very passionate very smart people who who care very deeply about the technologies that they're working on. So, if you have a question, don't be shy. Just go right up and and ask.

We call it the meeting at a conference because trying to get worked done as opposed to, like, hearing vendor presentations and stuff. About a thousand of them are local. Which is a fair amount. This is also the first time this facility hosted in international meeting. Certainly at this size. So that's pretty cool.
