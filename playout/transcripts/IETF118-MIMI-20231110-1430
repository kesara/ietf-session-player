Possibly. I guess, Oh, 23. Sure. Tracking arbitrary state. Sure. Yeah. I'll start there. So yeah. There's kinda just three issues that we kinda wanna take a look at, time permitting, of course. First one being just tracking arbitrary state here. So currently in the MeetMe protocol draft, we do not have the ability to, carry just informational state, like the room name, topic, that sort of stuff. So the proposal, for this, as well as all of the other issues we'll talk about today is to implement something post adoption. So they design team will be suggesting that the documents get sent for adoption in the next few weeks, and we'll we'll kinda take it from there. My comment from 5 hours ago there, is essentially to have an M room state event that will carry a state key and some arbitrary content blob. Although there's an open, question about whether that should be encrypted, how much of that should be encrypted, that sort of stuff. So, feedback. Welcome in the live venue here."

We we should define at least, like, a basic profile for the state that has the slots that we expect to be interoperable. And then maybe there's a way to extra fields on that that different applications require, but may not be, and we have less in your affordability. It's exactly to your point there, how arbitrary is arbitrary. Yeah. So, like, there is potentially provider specific information that, might be useful. What that information is. Might vary. But at least like the, like, we can have some standardized stuff like the name, in particular. And then other stuff carried as as per usual, I think. I can't see the cue from here. Sorry. Go ahead. Audible, it would really shouldn't be very controversial. Hi, Ryan, to say for some we should support arbitrary, like, any kind of key value data on a given conversation because we can't predict what features might need to be interoperated between the various different platforms here So if somebody goes and says, hey, I'm on an with her on this conversation. Somebody wants to give it a topic. Somebody wants to give it scriptions, somebody wants to give it a name, all of these other things we can provide a kind of baseline profile. The common interrupt. Having the extensibility, like, you get an XMPP. Or matrix to go and decorate these conversations with additional data just feels my table stakes,"

So I think that is a desirable property in some instances, not necessarily in all of them. So ideally, the design should be flexible in the way that's, may or may not be, a strict format for the content, but that's whether that is encrypted or not, should actually be completely untangled. So, obviously, we don't know how we would deal with key management here, that is something we will have to look into. But keeping the door open to being able to encrypted would be a good thing, I think. TKG? Daniel Condoner. So, I'm I'm obviously think that that we should be able to handle, encrypted shared state for the room I wanna point out that, from Matthew's comment, the idea of having separate you know, flexible, extensible namespace for different platforms, Does seem reasonable, but to the extent that shared room state is encrypted. If we do not encrypt the keys, that is the name there's lots of different means are the word key here. Right? So if this is a flexible option where you can say, well, this is the Avatar, and this is the name, and this is the motto or something like that. Those are sort of named the names themselves are not encrypted, that could itself be a problem. So I would like to encourage us to think and about having an encrypted bundle that itself may have within it some sort of Kid, kid, or indexed values instead of saying, well, we'll have you can have arbitrary names, and then those individual things could be encrypted.

So there should be agreement about what's in there. And regarding the encryption, we think this is generally a quite a hard problem because while we do have the MLS group underlying the group that's, you know, allows people to agree on key material that cumulative real is changing from epoch to epoch. And does you either have to re encrypt 66 so that people who left the group can no longer decrypt the blob. People that join the group can and, so can can then encrypt and decrypt the blob and reencrypt if necessary. So we either need to reencrypt the blob every time we change the epoch. We need to come up with an key rotation scheme outside of MLS that gives us some degree of post compromise security and forward secrecy. I think that's just generally a hard problem that we should if we want this, that we need to solve. Hi, everyone. May.

I just wanted to respond to Ron's suggestion to pump this further down roads. Which I think overlaps all sort of measurements proposal that to some extent. That it feels like we really should have a generic way and describing metadata about a room. Whether that's done at the MLS layer or then at the Mimi layer, is, debatable But if we ignore the requirement to be able to describe things, we end up with, say, the policy stuff being its own very domain specific thing with some sort of domain specific language, for for that, which is not aligned with generic key value mechanism, we can end up with 2 completely different things running around And then, yeah, perhaps we have different one for attachments and different one, the time and time again."

Folks seems to be have some enthusiasm about encryption. But it's not clear to me, kind of who this encryption would be designed to protect against. It seems to me like the the sort of stuff that's in this room state is likely stuff that intended to be visible to the providers involved in the conversation. So I guess the question is do we, do we intend for this stuff to be confidential. The the general stuff in this in this room states would be confidential from the providers. And if so, then then encrypting makes sense. But, if not, then I really get the point of the encryption. I'm gonna lock the queue. So if you wanna be in the queue, get in the queue. Jonathan. Oil line. So, I obviously, I don't think it's a good idea to try and design crypto while standing on one foot, but but is has the idea of using something like proxy re encryption where The server that although service provider rather can re encrypt the data under a different key without ever seeing the data. Based on a token issued by a member of the group, has that been considered as the mechanism for this, or are we just gonna do some magic. I believe the type of encryption that we're kind of thinking here is exclusively MLS related. Either as some form of message and then somehow negotiating keys, which is also an open question there. Particularly when you are dealing with something like the room name, which would be useful on an invite or an ad. But the target might not be participating in the conversation yet."

But they could issue a light token and then some processing could be done by a blinded server. Under Ron, go ahead. Oh, no. Richard is next. Sorry. Richard. Rowan, your next. Okay. So I'm gonna say again, We have no use we have no formal definition of what we wanna do. We have no requirements. We have no use case. Why are we talking about a mechanism As a stepping back as a meta issue, I don't think that we should be talking about these post adoption issues at all, when we have 18 open issues, in the in the repo for the protocol document, maybe it would be a better use of our time if we go through some of those. If we pick a handful of those and actually have a subset of discussion where we have real requirements and real use cases already. The use case here is definitely we need to communicate a room name somehow, this is also on the protocol document if we have a suggestion for another issue to look at, I'm happy to split. We do have a few sort of selected already. But you know, the more fundamental, the better. Yeah.

Yeah, I I agree, of course, with, around that maybe there are more pressing issues, but and since now, that's a lot now. So, to answer your question, Richard, I think We need the, crisp definition of a threat model here. And the intuition is that it is the same that we also apply for and to an encryption, meaning that's, we don't want the operator in the first place to be able to see some potentially sensitive data. Of course, it's debatable. How much of the data is actually sensitive and how much of it is needed in practice, but it's it's always a good starting point to, think about encrypting everything and then see what we have to have in the clear for functional reasons. And, as to the concrete mechanism. Simply because you brought it up, Jonathan, I think, We can use MLS as a starting point simply because we have that as a mechanism for key negotiation, but that doesn't mean that we couldn't go further and do proxy re encryption, for example, if we think that that is inadequate solution to the problem.

I believe in the context of the working group, but it might have been slightly outside of it.

And it knocks the person who when somebody answers a knock, I'm gonna when somebody knocks, they may provide a key package. So we don't wanna preclude Other things like that. But I think that providing that this is the the sort of the default way that you should go about getting a key package and saying that that's going through the hub I think that that's sensible guidance Hopefully, that makes sense. So this is, something that we've got wrong on matrix, and historically, where you end up with 2 different traffic patterns for messages versus, the equivalents of key packages and the double ratchet world in the Wilson Matrix, the events can go or the messages themselves can go full mesh, the keys, can only, or can go transitively. The keys have to go direct So you can end up with horrible situations where if you don't have full mesh connectivity, you can get the messages without having the keys And I think there is scope for a similar problem here. If you encourage people to get the keys directly from the source, and it sounds like they can't group. So then then No. There's no guarantee that two parties are actually connected in the full mesh here. Particularly in a DMA kind of world where you might have to massive for messaging silos here have gone and interrupted with one another, you might have somebody else.

In the past, we've sort of asked the question of whether or not there is even particularly in a DMA sense, a legal capability for those servers to communicate. Like they might be barred or prevented due to lacking legal agreement. I mean, I wouldn't design around that. Right?

So I don't know, Alice allows only her friends to fetch her key packages, something like that. And, for, I think for all the other relevant events, quote unquote that we have until now there is a We're more or less using MLS. So there's authentication built in. So if we have something that fetches key packages that is not unless we have to build some sort of Yep. Authentication into a signature based probably. I think that's what I meant. Okay. But if it is NLS, then we don't need an additional authentication mechanism. The hub can simply act as a assay, I sort of IP transit that just passes the MLS messages across to the or not server. True?

We've had a lot of, you know, confusion about terminology. I'm sure we will this is not gonna clear it all up, but it's trying to go some some way along the path. So how do we how are we framing this problem? This is a problem of of user discovery. So we have service specific identifiers, that identify a unique user within a single service provider have service independent identifiers, like, phone numbers and email addresses that identify a unique user. Independent of any service, And messaging providers want to be able to assert mappings from SIIs to SSIs so that we can actually exchange message between, between different providers. We spoke last time, sort came to an agreement that we anticipate there being a large number of messaging providers. That could exist in this interoperable system And clients or providers that are acting on behalf of clients, want to be able to discover which SSI's map to a given SII. So, user using their client wants to be able to input an SII. And figure out which SSIs are mapped. In general, clients or and the providers acting on their behalf are unlikely to be trusting all other messaging providers to, correctly assert the SII to SSI mapping. So it might be the case that between any two providers, they do trust each other, but we're into vading a world where some of them do not trust each other and they assume that some some providers will be, potentially maliciously asserting false SII to SSI mappings.

So In terms of the authentication problem, What we're trying to solve for here is that clients or or their providers, need to be able to trust these mappings. And when we think about the shape of this part of the problem, it starts to look a lot like a PKI so you can I think in We had this term before a discovery provider, which was pretty non specific? If we think about the authentication half of the problem, you can imagine mapping authority. Which is doing this authentication. And, It has a lot of the same kind of properties and constraints and, and threat model as CA's do in a in a BKI. And in terms of the kind of separability or convergence of roles, If you think about it this way, then it implies that There will there could be an option for messaging providers to be their own mapping authorities. Or for some messaging providers to use 3rd party mapping authorities. So we are likely to want to have the option of of either of those models. The distribution side of the problem, and if you assume that you have authenticated mappings. Then clients or providers that are acting on their behalf need an efficient way to query the mappings. So they need to be able to obtain these mappings from some place. And now you have, another different role which is the distribution point role separate from the map authority.

I just wanted to to pull out one pointer that is in bold on this slide, but, the the thought makes it maybe not super clear. I think they, an important to keep in mind in the stacks on me is that this, this, this, this division of labor between authentication and distribution means we have kind of 2 sorts of your mapping authorities who are trusted to assert the validity of mappings and mapping distribution points who actually hand out the information. So I think that's, those are the things that are distinct. And as as the previous slide may overlap, but those are distinct roles. On the because it's an important point for our design here. Thanks.

But I do think, we We need to have the requirements agreed, might continue to kind of ping pong back and forth, but Fantastic. Thanks. Giles, stupid question? No. I was trying to share my slides.

Yeah. I I understand that, but If you look at the way this works in the All current messaging providers evolve that model that it is essentially public. So we we did have a lot of discussion about that point, I don't I don't really agree with that. I think that there are lots of of messaging systems that are essentially username based and you know, if you don't know my username on that platform, then you can't find out if I use Yeah.

Right, which are relatively prominent mesting platforms of this forum, you have, like, some kind of public identifier that does end up being converted some sort of private identifier behind the scenes, the thing way that those get hidden from users is simply by virtue of the fact that that transformation happens while the message is in light. There is no, like, actual, like, discovery that you do as a round trip before you then go on to contact in s a in SSI. Right, for the end of the in question. So, I mean, I I I'm not sure how well this maps onto what all messaging provider systems do, and this needs to go back to much more fundamental discussion about what the requirements are and I think maybe there's a misunderstanding here that I am not talking about hiding SII from the request or talk we're talking about hiding the SII from the A but a user is hearing from The discovery provider. What you had is the discovery service. Which, again, because of the intervention, I think that Alyssa described at the beginning of this, are things so incredibly useful where we're gonna differentiate between, like, who is the authority that tells you what the mappings are. What are the distribution points from which you can achieve it? I think these, the kinds of privacy properties that are on the slide don't align with that either.

So I think there's like there's a few different concepts that are getting mixed together. So just for clarification. I think this What we're really talking about here is the, is the service reachability, not which is potentially separate from the mapping. I think the prior discussion about this was really driven by the service reachability, IE, today, any WhatsApp user can message type in a phone number and message another WhatsApp user and discover whether that phone number is associated to a WhatsApp account. Service reachability. That doesn't mean they learn anything about, like, the internal representation of of that phone number's account on WhatsApp. The separate issue. I think we should probably focus on the service reach ability. That's exactly Yeah. exactly what I meant. Yeah. And then the other thing is that this is you know, whether the system has this property or not, also has additional layers of discoverability control, built in, IE, If there's a provider who decides none of its users will be discoverable, that would impact the service reachability question. If there's a provider who gives their users the ability to control whether they individually are discoverable or not, that will also bear on this. I think it'd be useful to like scope out. Which of those situations people are asking for or are comfortable with or not with? Like, what are your assumptions about what other controls are in place, or are we assuming that those controls don't exist, or that we want the protocol to do certain things whether or not those controls exist.

Of you could you say again, what is the difference between service reachability, and the SII to SSI mapping Yeah. So I think service reachability is As the sender, I'm able to find out if of of of of if a particular phone number has an account, on a service, and the mapping is as a sender, I'm able to find out what the account is that's associated with a particular phone number. Mimi SSI when you say the account. Yeah. See. I see. So okay. So the this I think there's an implied assumption here that the SSI contains some additional information that is somehow enlightening beyond the SII itself. Like, to me, the main problem is the bullying. Like, is it is it on that account or not? Is is actually, a sensitive information. The the SSI is like whatever. It's a UUID at provider name or it'll, you know, so like encouraging focus on the Boolean question. On the bullying question. I think whether the identifier gets shared or not is is I see. I see. Okay. That that's helpful. Thank you. not Alright. So then then the comment I would make, which which then I think so applies is think the problem is we're building a system in which we have, like, a fundamental contradiction like, the the ability to message from someone in provider a to provider b, requires us to discover that provider b is the right provider, which means like this bullying somehow needs to be communicated to the origin provide. Like, there's no solution in which that doesn't happen. The problem is then that is somewhat sensitive. So what we're gonna so the problem is not to say it's private or not. The problem is we have to wrap controls and constraints on the distribution of that information. That's the thing we need to focus on. And I'm suggesting it's thing Like, we need to build a a system that prevents enumeration. We need to build a system that rate limits the distribution of that information based on properties."

The way that it provides this property of being able to prevent you from scraping the full list of account holders, is that it performs its transformation when a message is in flight. And so you have to pay the cost of sending the message in order to trigger that transformation happening. And the actual information that is used to make that transformation is actually often synthesized effectively in real time. From a variety of data sources. That, like, occur in the telephone that, like, while these things are happening, that's anytime we're bringing, like, TNs as identifiers, there is this, like, parade of Horrible that lives behind it, but that has been that has had to confront these problems since these became it's the whole idea of sending a message to a telephone number came into existence.

They're not just focused on the old ones, which I, I mean, the ones I call external, but I I by that term, I mean, identifiers that come from a different service like email or the telephone number. And indeed, especially in the 1st phase, we will need to let users be identified by their telephone number and but, I think there are good reasons for also having something different And well, the the first reason I'll come to that, but is that my my telephone number, I mean, I've been having the same telephone number since 1999. The same email address since 2006. I don't want definitely everyone that has those either the phone number of the to to be able to try to contact me on on me. I might want to have something which is completely new and independent from these pieces of information which were born for something different than you'd very different ways. But then, of course, there's the 3rd case, which is when There are people that already have your phone number and might want to try to contact you. And some users, not all the users might actually want to be contacted to facilitate the fact that anyone having their email their email address, for example."

    "text": "Can contact them immediately. So this should be under control of the user. Next slide. So I tried to I tried to come up with a list of requirements. And, well, I I think they're, I mean, the the first one is the core one. It's what what I was talking out is that I I think it should really be up to the user to decide whether they want to be reachable by four numbers or email addresses. And this logical implies the fact that users that don't want to be rich by by the older identifiers that must have a way to create something new. And this gives us possibilities maybe to do something better and and basically to skip all the problems we now have in dealing with the privacy phone numbers and email addresses. And, of course, these kind of new identifiers should be human readable and easy to use, a bit like email addresses. So, that's the model I was using. And the another important thing is I think that Also, it should be possible for users to get their identifier from a provider. They don't don't have to think of this. They just get it and say, but it should also be possible for users that wanted to have provider independent identifier. Means that, I mean, we now come from a model in which, you, you open up one account for each, instant messaging service, 1 for WhatsApp, 1 for Telegram, if you get sick and don't want to use WhatsApp anymore, just close But we now want to transition to a model in which you only have one account possibly on one provider. And when you get seek of that provider, move it to a different account. And this implies that you should be able to keep this, the service, independent identifier while you move to a different provider and so 2 different service specific identifiers. And this is, and it's important in my mind so that that, this is also possible by the user. So And okay. So next slide. I got a quick clarifying question. So is this entire solution predicated in we're creating a new class of identifiers that are and that existing SII's and SSI's or whatever are going to be subordinate to that And I don't know if I got it, but"

So you should be able to choose whether you want to use 1 or the other So this solution does not require that you have a news No. Absolutely. There will be people that definitely don't want to have a new specific identifier. Next one. Okay. So Well, I think it's pretty simple ones. I mean, the the one the one I wanted to focus on is the decentralization I mean, there was some discussion with this in the interim that someone said, but, I mean, we got an the the that there's no surveillance by encrypting everything. And I agree. Of course, we should encrypt everything. But I I think also the if we can about centralized mapping the system. So however you want to call them, so we can make it so that there's not a single point of failure and a central point in which all the can come. I think that in the the privacy properties would be better. And also the let's say the architectural problem is to keep the inter distributed. And, but, I mean, I'm I'm really trying to conceive this, an environment in which people that really want to do so, and there are a few people might want, some will should be able to self host everything, their their mini service, and their discovery service. But again, much like he may. And of course, this also implies that we should use Open Technologies and positive technologies, which have, opens those implementations and then already and well understood Next one. So and then there are he he also listed some requirements for each child, not But again, I think it it's important to think of this. We have to choose something which doesn't immediately create a regulatory issue or intellectual property issues or something on on on the identifiers that we are going to use. And there's a reason for people to actually run it. So it is the model in that sense. Next slide. So I next. So I did think I mean, be coming from a in as an email company. Of course, I try to see whether we could use DNS for this. And the answer is maybe I'm not saying we should use. I mean, I think it should be one of the options on the table. And we should think"

    "text": "because in the end, DNS is what is actually used for discovering, basically, all the main internet service today. I mean, you use DNS to discover the email provider for an email address. And use DNS to discover the web hosting provider for a website So, I mean, why not using the, I mean, you need also to discover your mini provider for you identifier. However, you call and the I mean, and and this would have the advantage that the infrastructure is there. We already know how to deal it. It's really available to everyone. Of course, I mean, this works as long as the identifier is a DNS host name or maybe a URI, which has a DNS host name in it. But of course, it it's I mean, it could be made work with email addresses. Could I mean, it's very hard to imagine to make it work for telephone numbers. So again, could be a solution for something new if we decide GNS is a NDS last time, like, formats are the way to go. I don't think she this would be, like, the solution for the email and numbers about But so this could live together with some of the other solutions that are being present. Don't know if he your question now or Yeah. I would take them to into people. Yeah. I mean, I know we only have, like, 3 minutes left. So I guess I'm gonna say 2 things at once real quick. Hardly suitable for telephone numbers, and I was referring to MMS routing, not MLS, but, like, that stuff that people using their phones. That is entirely in them based. Effectively and stay in the world. Right? And it's not based on public income as you're characterizing your draft, but on private minimum solutions, is actually the technology is used to resolve all of the messaging involved stuff when we're still aware of that, like, actually is inter domain that's out there in the world today. The second thing I wanna say since we have so little time, I'm just anticipating your future slides, why you would define new DNS resource records for this when there are NAAPT records in fee records and all the remainder of that. If we wanna do it this way, surely we would do that. All the metadata parameters you wanna add to it, we can simply add into Napster records and the things implementations that do this all the time. It used to that. Yeah. I mean, let's get to the next slide. Yes. I did put, a new mini record because I'm"

People just use the records. And but this is, I mean, this Oh, he was a s v S v e c b or whatever? No. They don't. They actually use the stuff I was just talking about to do this for actually routing this from SII today. Okay. Anyway, it's mean, this is just an example to make it, I mean, to make it clear the kind of solution that could be, but then we we would entirely have to discuss whether it would be existing resource cycle, the unusual cycle, or some, I mean, and whether the fields would be at best of this way or in another way, point is just that you would have to identify somewhere in the DNS if you get from the other, I mean, a list of parameters, it is everything you need to understand 1 or more accounts and who is merging them. And, establish a connection. And then from there, I mean, it's not the scope of the draft. So but since there are concerns about, I mean, Indeed, some of the account names you know, existing services include personal information like your name, you use I mean, it depends on the user. Might not might but but they might. And so there's there's 2 alternatives. 1 is to you actually put everything that you need into the DNS, including the account line, for WhatsApp, it would be your telephone number or next slide, I think we should hear from Yeah. No. You wanna wait. Let's hear from Kalia before we move on. Yeah. I was accurate Okay. So, otherwise, next slide just to show that you can do the same thing without putting the personal information And what would happen is, like, he may that you then con I mean, the client then connects to each of the desired services that implies the identifier in there if they get the account name. And so this doesn't go through the DNS and doesn't have the privacy problems of DNS queries. So that's it. I mean, basically next slide, I think that the first question before discussing anything about this is whether want to have this kind of independent identifiers that are designed from scratch just for me, me, for the people that don't want to use"

Mean, this was meant to be a, let's say, a focused and limited solution for a specific problem rather than something bigger. I think indeed there are, like, tons of identity efforts.

And I think this is actually like a pre or questions. Right? Like, we don't need new identifiers, potentially. So go ahead. I mean, You're gonna be at the end of the queue here. Yeah. I know we're over time, but since this question is posed Alan, what you're gonna be in the I think he, yeah, he he just probably probably I'm not, I think, by or I I don't think we should pursue new, maybe specific identifiers if what you mean by that is identifiers humans are going to use. I think there are intermediate transformation right, between, I can imagine some places where there are privacy properties we get going from SSI to an SSI with some intermediate thing. But that's hidden from the user. I think we're focused here on how to get applications that largely exists today to be able to communicate with each other with the identifiers they use. Rather than defining some new maybe specific hierarchy. Yeah. But there are plenty of instant messaging services that don't use either email addresses or their phone numbers. So, I mean, I think that there's already a space in which people don't want to use that. If I don't want to use those identifiers, what do I do How do you need me? My my well, I understand I'm not mirror they Again, even within Blue Sky, I agree. They use domain names within that. That's an existing identifier. I'm saying, let's not the IETF go out and add a 57th to the 56 existing identifiers that messaging platforms use, if we're intending these to be identifiers used by users. For, again, intermediate transformations that might be different. Alright, Alan. Take us home. Hope time.
