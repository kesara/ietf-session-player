    "text": "we can go and choose what we put in but well there\u0027s obviously other concerns and well I\u0027d be interested to hear about those and that leads me to the second question is that something like the problem itself maybe not the solution that we have we have to but the problem is that is that something that ops AG is interested in looking into because as I said the gentleman from the financial industry Steve you\u0027ll say well like I have to stay with physical devices unless you solve that problem for me at least for firewalls thoughts comments may you want to go on Chris Mauro Google Jeff is saying that\u0027s what the H the authentication header is for in IPSec so Warren quarry I did look at this a while back and I\u0027ve sort of forgotten don\u0027t you either need to do this over the whole contents of the packet or just accept the fact that somebody can replace the payload later and you still have proof that it went through it yeah correct oh so I think that\u0027s the whole point like you can either so the first incarnation of that document that we had was exactly like you can swap the payload and the headers been very front choice you can link the payload to the metadata by providing a hash across the payload and well by that way and ensuring that you\u0027re verifying that the contents been through that that\u0027s where we are right now Chris Mongo Chris tomorrow Google how does this work for like cut-through switching and things like that ridges do people not care about the switch part of the path because the packets gonna be out the door before you can figure out what the hash if it was supposed to be there\u0027s instances like this I\u0027m sure yeah I think there it comes with certain deployment assumptions we\u0027ve been starting this effort purely really for the the NFB problem well we do believe that we have well control on the exit door like a potential V switch or whatever but well yeah I think it comes with certain deployment constraints and and also I think I\u0027ve not seen a single chip set today that is able to do a modular prime operation efficiently in hardware software data plane like VPP "

    "text": "modern issue everything Jeff can ask you clarification question on your statement that because aah for me doesn\u0027t figure the requirement jeff has so not the hop I have requirement this is specifically that this packet has been touched by a sniffing box only that perk if we agree on this yeah sorry Chris again Jeff white not just just encrypt it decrypt encrypted decrypt it and on every hop of the network and you could see or just stick multiple H headers on the packet yeah no question is it\u0027s this something that this working group is even interested in schinsky Yahoo speaking for almost every hardware vendor that because they\u0027re only capable looking at 256 bytes of the packet yet so yeah I mean at some point you majorly break every chip set out there Nana but we didn\u0027t answer at Frank\u0027s question so think about this question for another 10 seconds then come answer what could be interesting is not that this is a final point that could very verify the pass but the or the origin element that could check the bus because this is a original point that what that the fro goes through this so you want some feedback from Clara fire to the originator of the packet that his package was delivered across the right the way yeah well you want it yes so it\u0027s seemingly I think it is at least a problem that catches some some interest [Music] all right thanks guys with this I guess it concludes the kyboot meeting thanks for coming everyone got the Blue Shield by the way "
