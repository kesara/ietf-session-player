Hey, IITF 119Dolt detecting unwanted location truckers working group. Yay. We're in the security area. This is Thursday of the IATF. So if you've been around for the whole week. You'll have seen many of these slides before, so we may go through them quickly, for those in remote land, you may not have so this is the note well. Basically, this is if you have any of the you know about IPR? See something, say something, additional rules about working through procedures and processes and any harassment procedures, etcetera. Copying and pattern write stuff. If you have any questions, you can ask the chairs. You can area director, you can ask other people that have been around for a while. Let you know. This is the note really well. This is down to the professional conduct kind of stuff. Treat everybody's respect. You don't have to like their idea you need to be polite to them at the microphone. Or online or wherever we're interacting. Some meeting tips, for in person participants, please make sure to, scan the QR code or log in via the data tracker, to make sure that we get an appropriately sized room for next time. So I said, some people, this is a massive room. There's, like, 700 seats, and there might be fifty people in here. My concern is that when we go back to Vancouver, we're gonna get a small room and a 150 people. We did in San Francisco. So, for what, for whatever we can do to goose it, make sure you please, scan sign in here. Also, we're gonna use the meeting tool to get in and out of the queue. So that'll be there will be, will be fair to the remote participants to make sure we manage it that way. So if you're gonna get to the queue, need to be logged in so you can press the button."

This is the a knit well, I put the scribe selection in here to remind me to ask someone to describe notes We do not need it play by play. Of all the things that are said, but we do need kind of like the high level action points that get taken. And, some flavor around what people are saying at the microphone. Can I get a volunteer? Oh, hey, Mike. Cheaper's great. Thanks, man. I owe you many more beers. We're also gonna do some introductions. We're kind of merging 2 communities here into 1. We're all gonna be in this together. And so I think we wanted to do a little bit of reductions some of you may not know me, and it's a bunch of high checkers point in no Erica. We kinda wanna do that. And I thought this would be interesting, and then I saw the whimsy working group just got charted this time to do it. And I thought, oh, that's really pretty great. So same thing. And then we got some, presentations where we got, Maggie Delano and Jesse Lowell and talk about unwanted tracking scenarios and implications for adult adult protocol design. Then Sudhika is gonna do some, state of the current internet draft and internet implementations. And then, Brent's gonna do some suggestions on how to start the working group. Internet draft process. I've uploaded all slides. So you can download them now if you wanna read ahead. But let's, let's get going. So introductions. Hey. It's me. I volunteered to do this.

About 18 of those have been looking at the Intersection of Technology And victim Services. I currently am at the National Network And Domestic Violence at project that looks specific at techno how this technology is the tactic of abuse stocking sexual assault domestic violence trafficking. But also at how survivors strategically use technology to increase their privacy to to maintain their safety. And for the last 10 years or so, we've been, sitting on a bunch of advisory boards, working with companies around design and really thinking through the scenarios of, domestic violence, intimate partner abuse. And how that changes the concept of safety and privacy. Security. So that's my background. In this space back, we started talking about Bluetooth trackers, and all the ways that we were seeing them impact survivors"

Thank And and at the in this conversation, It it is really exciting because, you know, as, as Sean has said, we are bringing 2 different fields of expertise together, and the goal here is us to work together, to really develop and advocate for meaningful solutions. That can lessen the harms associated with the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices. That is our merting these feasts. We've got a lot of gender based violence kits who are very familiar with the technology familiar with the game. We're excited to share that experience and also, people who have been sitting in both spaces as x person generates violence, but also technologists. And we're really learning from everybody and be a part of this conversation. So I will leave it there because I know we have lots of, conversations, but I'm very excited that we're fine Yeah.

In order for the adult protocol to be successful, working groups need an understanding of what the unwanted tracking landscape today currently look like. And that means from a technological perspective, but it also means from the perspective of the people who, are, are being affected. By this unwanted tracking and the people who work directly with them. And advocate for them. So In the interest of that, I know that, I I know that threat modeling and risk modeling are very familiar concepts, too. A lot of people in tech. And one thing that we've found is that, People are often very familiar with the concept of threat modeling but they don't necessarily have the experience in thinking through gender based violence, scenarios, that that would help them to be able to through threat model adequately for this kind of purpose. And so in the interest of that, we'll share common unwanted tracking scenarios and we'll also share, the the limitations of current protocols or presentation aims to contribute to several different, working group goals including threat analysis, Including, documentation of the current state of tracker accessory platforms, and then also Standards track protocol and guidance for preventing unwanted tracking.

And so There's no actual identifying info in these scenarios. They are composite cases, that I wrote based on, may experience working with survivors myself, with hearing report from the field, also providing case consultations, with with community programs. And so, these are I I I wrote these they're composite cases, and I wrote them to illustrate several different angles of problem. Not only technological angles, but angles that are meant to provide realistic insight into survivor's constraints because as with any tech, we can't forget about human factor about the user experience, about what things are actually like for users who are usually late people, And so with that, I'll get into the first scenario.

So she and Anna me at a public playground. She gets there early so that Anna will not see which bus route she arrived on and keep playing with the children on the playground until after Anna leaves. So that Anna will not see which bus route they get on. But 2 days later, Anna shows up at Malka's door, pounding on the door and shouting. So, some thoughts about the scenario and, and why I put it in here, Co parenting situations, We're an abuser and a survivor or co parenting. Are very common, and we've had, We've had lots of reports from the field. Over time about abusers using kids as an opportunity to introduce tech facilitated stalking in general, including to introduce location trackers I I I I worked in a program where, You know, I was working primarily with survivors who had just relocated or were fleeing.

She lives in a car dependent area, and cannot visit friends without the car. And Edward controls all of their money. So she cannot take the car to the mechanic without him knowing. And So the, part of the point of this scenario as indicated by the title is that, people can't always physically find trackers. Even when they know they're there, objects like cars are very large complex vehicles. And, and so you know, it's it's not always easy to figure out exactly where something has been planted. Another reason that, I I put this scenario in, is because this is may be in a near owner state, which is is, a reference to, The the proposed protocol from the folks at Apple And Google where a tracker could be in a near owner state or a separated state.

And I think it's important to realize that people do engage in unwanted cracking to someone they live with sometimes. It can be used as a way to prevent them from leaving, among other things. That's another angle to think through. Next slide, please. Scenario 3, This is, this is a tricky one. Surviver cannot use tech to scan for a location tracker, or to receive alerts. How you and Ming have been dating for 2 years? Main works for a tech company, and often emphasizes how much more he knows technology than how you Who works at a restaurant? He insists on having access to how you use computer and Android phone. So that he can make sure they are working well and that there are no dangerous apps. Ming hits How you when he's angry, and has threatened to out him as gay to his conservative parents and report him to immigration and enforcement. If. How you talks back to him. Tight, With an advocate at a local domestic violence program, to talk about going to their shelter. Once a bed was available, the advocate did some safety planning with how you and mentioned during that, the there is an app for Android that can scan for location trackers. But how you did not feel safe installing them because Ming would see it. The next time how you went to see the advocate He chose a time when he knew Ming had to be at work until late. To make sure that he did not follow him."

So this this is this this is a d a difficult one because it is a case where The abuser has a high level of technology, This is especially common in regions and ethnic cultural communities that have a very high, percentage of tech workers. It's also a difficult one because that there is an app that how you would potentially be able to use, except you can't safely install it. And An abuser having a lot of, ability to see what a survivor is doing with their tech is, is very common. In abusive relationships, It's also a case where, How you, the survivor is undocumented and he might not feel comfortable involving law enforcement. And that means that privileges, the police have an investigation and requesting records from companies might not apply. In a situation like that. So in some sense, this, this scenario is kind of a hard mode 1. I I, I meant it to capture some very realistic dynamic but it's also just tricky. And one thing I want to note about all these scenarios is that in each pace, the survivor was doing things try to take precautions, but there was something Do the but the there were still barrier and reasons that precautions didn't end up being the way they wanted. I know that these can sound like edge Oops. Oops. Places."

So before I tell this, I just wanna that these quotes are are courtesy of the clinic and tech abuse at Cornell Tech, which are Mister So we were talking a little bit about, the kind of feedback that people have gotten. And this, again, this is intended to be some example feedback, not something that has to be addressed right the questions that we've gotten are, you know, I get an alert for an air tag, how long has it been following me? Where can I see this? Is there a way to find an air tag tracker immediately before someone enters certain place, for example, can I find out who owns a tracker if I can't physically find it? And it would be helpful to have a explanation protocol. So, for example, there's a between 8 to 24 hours window that's used, when a when a device is separated before a notification is issued, And it's not clear how that window size was chosen. So you can go to the next line. So now we're gonna talk a little bit. You might have some idea of what's in the limitations the existing"

    "text": "might be, but we'll kind of get more into the the tech angle as well to talk about that. So next slide, please So, one of the kind of big takeaways from these scenarios is that we need both ability to actively scan for trackers but also passively scan for trackers and be alerted when a accurate might be nearby. And in terms of, like, some concrete constraint that we have to keep in mind while we're designing the protocol, if you keep in mind that people might not be able to install software, so it might be helpful, for something's built into the operating system. People's counts might be compromised, and so they might not have privacy. And also people might not own a smartphone or have a way to otherwise engage with the, use a use a platform. To prevent the tracking. Next slide, please. And so in terms of the current unwanted tracking landscape, I basically like, 4 popular, brands of trackers. I and and this table kind of summarizes the kind of, affordances that those have today. So, Apple AirTag for example, use the Find My network, and right now they have these passive scanning. So these these alerts, that come up, that are available both on Android and on iOS. But in terms of active scanning, that's only currently available, on Android. Then with tile, tile is another one of very popular or that has existed even for air tags. That uses the tile, uses their own network, they have active scanning, but no passive scanning available right now. Chipolo, is a tracker that uses to find my network. And it only has a passive scanning available on iOS. And then Samsung has their own network as well, and they focus on active scanning. So I can see that kind of the whole point of this working group is to come up with some sort of standardization. But as part of that, I think one of the things that I wanna emphasize is that it's really important that that standardization includes both passive scanning and active scanning, on"

    "startTime": "00:30:00",
    "text": "major operating systems. That's my own opinion. Next slide, please. And so, just to talk a little bit about some example limitations and as John said I'm not here to pick on a Apple or on air tags, and I just chose them as an example because that's the research that I've done, and they're also a very popular tracker. And so I'll talk a little bit about, the lack of scanning for, active scanning for air tags on iOS, and then also a little bit about lack of customization, particularly for a passive skimming. Next slide, please. So if someone does want to actively scan their environment for a Bluetooth tracker. One of the things that you can do is you can download a third party Bluetooth scanning app. So the app that I'm showing the screenshots from is the NRF Connect app, which I actually use all the time in my research, and when you scan in a busy urban area, there could be even more than a 100 devices that might come up, on the Bluetooth each of the devices kind of look like the picture shown there. And it turns out that certain types of of, location trackers can be very easily identified because they have an AM associated with them. So for example, tiles can be very easily found and filtered, on iOS or on Android. By, you know, just searching, scrolling or typing in tile and filtering and you can see that there's a title there. You can also see, the signal strength then advertisement interval. And in this case, although there would be no, ultrayband, way to help you find it, you could know that there was a tile near you, which could still potentially be useful. Next slide, please. However, air tags, are much more difficult to uniquely identify, especially on iOS. So airtags don't have, like, a Bluetooth name associated with them, so they show up as an n slash a. Lots of other devices also show up as as n/as. So just it being an n/a does really tell you anything. So if you're trying to figure out if there's something near you that shouldn't be. The only thing that you have to rely on is the, signal strength"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:32:03",
    "text": "or the advertisement interval. And again, the advertisement interval isn't necessarily unique an Apple product. Lots of things could advertise at 2 seconds, if they wanted to. But the signal strength is maybe somewhat of a good indicator, although it really pens on the scenario. If it in a car or if it's in your house, it might be right near you. And again, with that ultra wide band, it's hard to find a a device. However, one of the unique things about iOS in particular is that it actually does not even have access manufacturer information. So if you knew that it was an Apple product, that might allow you to narrow down from these hundreds of product, of devices find one that's an air tag. And it turns out actually that this is exactly the way that third party, scanning app to scanning apps on Android work. So But on iOS, that data is not available. So if you can go to the next slide, please. So this is just to show you what kind of what's missing. So on the left hand side, basically the the Bluetooth logs that are dumped from an app that I wrote That just basically shows the, the the advertisement data that is, collected when you scan for these different devices. So an with an air tag, we're basically missing what's called the KCB advertisement data manufacturer data. So it is being stripped. So third parties don't have access to that information. Which makes it just slightly harder for people to find air tags on iOS without relying on, built in iOS, which right now is only passive. So there's no active way to do this. And, just for comparison, you can see with the bose soundlink on the bottom, there's, this, like, 9 byte long, advertisement manufacturer data that is available. And one of the to hear why, is that, The the manufacturer data, there's nothing secret about it. It's it's fully a readily available on Android. And on Mac, it's just that for some reason, it's not available on on iOS. Next slide, please?"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:34:03",
    "text": "So, in terms of addressing this again, this is just like an an example of one of the things that we could potentially, incorporate into the standard is the idea that the advertised manufacturer data should be available to 3rd party developers. And especially if it's not going to be available to 3rd party developers, then active scanning should be implemented by the operating system. Again, there's some discussion about, like, what we can require pop forms to do, but I think This is really important, and we should talk about a way to encourage if not require it as to to comply with the standard. Okay. Okay. Next slide, please. The other thing I just wanted to mention is of the limitations around the lack of customization. So right now, if the if the passive scanning is implemented on an operating system, there isn't any way to customize your settings and besides, basically, besides family sharing. So you can kind of, like, snooze in air tags so you don't get vacations for your spouse's air tag if you don't want to. But outside of that, there's not a lot of customization. So you can imagine that customization would be very well, if you want to be more stringent or if you want to be less stringent And just, like, as a point of reference, I tracked myself driving from Philadelphia to Boston, and I only received an alert hours after I already arrived, and it's about a 6 hour drive. You can imagine, like, with one of the scenarios Jesse talked about, that could lead to a very unsafe situation for someone because They've been tracked for that entire duration. In terms of, like, some ideas that we could think about, for optimization. You could think about decreasing or increasing the traveling with you duration before passing the vacation. You could think about decreasing, increasing the number of sounds before a device goes dormant. Or sending a notification each time a sound is played. So right now, on an air tag, It plays a sound 10 times, and then after that, it it kind of goes dormant. And I think we can also talk about smart defaults as a way to avoid false positives, like, while respecting autonomy of individuals who might be learned about their safety."

So, we think it would be really important to please. Oh, additional scenarios based on real world experiences. So, Jesse's scenarios are are are a great starting point, but there's lots of other ones that we could imagine as well. And I think what what's really important then is to kind of take these scenarios and then use them to evaluate the affordances of the existing tracking approaches, the the passive and active implementations that we have today. And how they address the real world scenarios and then use that to inform the development of requirements the algorithms accordingly. It's basically really tying the requirements of the algorithms to the scenarios because right now, I think hard to evaluate the draft protocol without understanding the kinds of scenarios that we're trying to address. I know other things that we didn't really talk about in our presentation, but that has been brought up soon is also the idea that we need to understand a little bit more about what kind of adversary we're trying to protect against. And that's something that should also be considered and then kind of the last thing that came up as Jesse Nair were talking about was kind of like a specific thing, which is thinking about the affordances of the near owner stakes and whether or not that makes sense, especially in an active scanning kind of scenario. Okay. And I think, just acknowledgements is last. So I just wanna thank, Lana Ramji Nick Doty, Alice's kind of hog Hancock, and Andrew Crawford for their input.

It started being used, by for advertisement, but also for some other purposes, nowadays, we have evolved, the 8 or 211 specifications, we are pushing for MAC address randomization, and we are actively looking at ways to make it harder because we realize that it's not only just randomizing the MAC address.

Potentially, right now, we're discussing mac addresses at multiple times, or for a group of people at the same time so that we avoid identifying who is changing the MAC address I guess my point, coming back to your presentation is that here in the IETF, I I would like to not go one technology at a time, but do something a little more generic that we can provide good guidelines for stopping or basically helping not only for one specific technology, because I see this happening in the past for Wi Fi. Now for Bluetooth, for perhaps in the future, ultra wideband, then narrowband, then it's going to be near few communications, and and then we would need to repeat this every 2, 3 years. So 11, Carlos. Well, I just wanna jump in here. That we do have a chartered. So we have to kind of follow that. The beginning, and I think we have to get something done. And that's kind of the point, like, And the charter restricts us to Bluetooth? I think it restricts us to Bluetooth. If I'm correct. Right? Okay. So I would challenge that a little bit. In at least"

But puts in the charter. Fair enough. If we keep that as a short term, view, but I would not like to to miss the the long term because again, this is this is something that the technology is faster than the IETF in if we wanna be meaningful, I think we should look at the big picture. Thank you. Alright. Next is Tommy Poly. Alright. Tommy Poly Apple. So as Juan Carlos said, thank you to Maggie and Jesse for sharing. There's definitely good to kick off with this context. With regards to the charter, I think We are not just Bluetooth here, but it is scoped to like, location trackers. So is narrowly scope, but, like, it it you we can define payloads that work on other transports other than Bluetooth. Certainly. That's good. The comment I came up here for was regarding some of the comments made about what is exposed to 3rd party app in APIs on a OS So First, you know, while ham at apple, trying to help the effort along. I'm not on the air tags team, so don't know the details there or why that's not explosive. No idea. No context. But as someone who works on other APIs and considering, like, what we exposed to third parties, Sometimes there are privacy reasons where we're trying to stop third party apps from being malicious in tracking a user's location, and that's why some of the information is bleached. So when we are specifying things here, I I think we would, you know, figure this out as a working group. But I don't think we should be trying to encode in any standard. Operating systems need to expose these particular types of APIs to That's usually not what we would do. Instead, we need to put requirements on what needs to be possible to be done by"

Tell me if you find that one as opposed to giving me every manufacturer around me. So just things like that. Tommy, Paulie, that reminds me of when Murray used to get to the microphone.

Chris, Risha, independent. I just was thinking about additional scenarios and how some of the scenarios have been laid out. One concern is that maybe we should actually reach out more to people in other parts of the world especially global south because maybe there are cultural elements that we are not considering, and they might perhaps overlap with existing scenarios, but they might also help us identify additional scenarios. But but I think someone else asked that in the chat, and I think, now that we're chartered as a working group, I think we'll probably get scenarios from all over the place. Bob? My hello. My point here is on the defense side against these devices, to be careful of talking about jamming as defense because the Civil Aviation so or agencies around the world are mandating remote ID to run over bluetooth a Wi Fi and Thus, if you jam the fees for fees frequencies, on, you can then get into regulation violation first responders you need to know watch up in the air.

Which is good for an initial analysis but there are a large communities of people who work where people are actively discouraged from having smartphones So no Android, no iOS, and we should think about these people as well. Nelly? Yeah. Nelena, Arkansas, This is, actually, I'm glad about the the comments about the global south because we have been, doing, a bunch of studies in India, with location trackers. And when the problems happens is that, we gotta tile, and whatever they are, $20 or whatever in the US. With it, with the rupee being 80 80 rupees to the dollar. It's completely unaffordable. To, most people in India And so we had we we we couldn't find a location tracking network at all. Was super interesting because we started looking we have a lot of windows devices. People have smartphones, but they don't have the location tracking apps because we don't have we don't have those kind of things. We can certainly bring some of work in, if, if you guys want.

You, it it or there's lives which, you you know, identify a number of sort of issues with the current environment do you have a set? So some of those issues it seems like are ones that have straightforward solutions that you point to and perhaps there's some issues that do not have straightforward solutions. Do you have a sense of, like, what the envelope is of of of No. No. What things we could do that we sort of are well understood to improve the current situation versus what things actually we do not understand and, like, are hard problems. We have to kind of, attack And maybe you don't, in which case, just take it up later, but, it'd be I think it'd be helpful to understand, you know, what extent we're kind of documenting things that are sure well understood and what extent we're actually having to, like, really think through hard in problems. Thank you. I mean, I guess I would just say that for me, like, I've read the draft standard, and I've I've, you know, given feedback on it, but I think it's just really hard to assess it because the there is no clear threat model that's described in the in that document. So if if the authors of that document had one in mind, I don't I don't know what it is. So I just I just think that, like, I feel like I can't really say. I'm gonna have some of my own opinions, and then we have, like, the scenarios, but I think we need to flesh out the scenarios a lot more. I mean, incorporating the comments that people made about Global South and and different, like, different networks and different technologies and all of that before we can really say. But, I mean, I don't think that the kinds of things that we're trying to do are insurmountable technically difficult, I think that it just requires a good understanding of the threat model in order to design something that's going to be most impactful.

In the coming months, we got some feedback, most see over, the GitHub repo that that we had and incorporates some of the feedback and Submitted an inversion. In December, also I'd like to highlight that this will be the, This is basically the version that Android and iOS, are referring to for, the cross platform support.

So, I will, go into the key pieces, a little bit, but first, I want to show, in this book there around how kind of these these pieces, are coming together, into the big picture.

And the first thing that happens is it starts broadcast is presence, in in a in a separate or not. If the tracker is moving with someone else's formed this this person can be, a victim of amount of tracking. On their device, the amount of tracking, algorithm will pick up the signal And that's what the third, block shows here. And next comes the other thing and other actions that the user can take, for example, they see another they see what kind of record this is. They see potentially a picture, a name, they can see what other issues are possible. For example, playing sounds, how to disable this tracker, some other actions meaningful actions that the user can take to to get out of this situation, basically. These are really Boxes 4567, I guess. Most of them are are covered with this Yeah. On the on the table, on the right, you are seeing whether these my thought what these, blocks are doing along with whether they are in scope or not.

So we said in the separated moats the tracker will start advertising, is presence And this is the header format that that we have currently in the draft. So it has a MAC address optional flags It has a service state of Tlv. With the value of FCB 2, which is newly created for the spike. Whenever, aservice.intel, we is scanned with with this value. We have you know that it's a device that is adhering to this spec. Obviously, another important one is the new owner bits also known as the separates of bits, transitioning into, the separated bit requires the accessory to be not detectable by the owner more than 30 minutes. And, currently additional condition of allocation reporting the online device is also acceptable And, the rest basically company specific payroll data. Next slide please. A bit more on the MAC address, so this is a 6 by Bluetooth MAC address. It should be recognizable by the owner device but should look random to everyone else, basically. The owner device must be able to credit the, coming MAC address in order to suppress unwanted tracking alerts that might be caused by the devices on the accessory. And the MAC address should rotate periodically in the near owner"

So let's say, the algorithms detected potential malicious use and, send an alert. What does this include and what can the user do with this? It takes us to the no longer interface and So this is defined, via a get service and kinda theristic or elite. And again, this is a newly defined, service and characteristic for, basically, the spec What you can see in the table is capabilities are basically the bits that are exposed through this service, and they can be read, using different hookups. For example, manufacturer model names are useful to platforms so that in the other, they can show what what kind of a thing this is what's the manufacturer, what's the model. So it show relevant information to the users. Accessibility capabilities, again, are useful for For example, if it's, NFC supported accessory the next steps in the UI can be adjusted based on that versus if it's, if it supports identify or look up by a daily next steps might be different.

No. So, the accessories must have a way, to You need the item to fight. Some cases, this could be just a serial number that is printed on the tag. But there could be other ways, like, identified dual can be available or, NFC tab or Bluetooth Elite. And, for the accessories that support identify and look up over Bluetooth any, and additional physical interaction is required. For example, button press will actually enable the retrieval, identify retrieval, retrieval over bluetooth. The reason of this design is to avoid a situation that a bypasser actually or or someone very close to you, can read read and identify, through, basically connection.

This registry, and Information like disable instructions, how I went fire lookup. Can be performed, etcetera. And this will enable those devices to be detectable by platforms.

And I I know the next presentation will kinda try to talk about what direction we wanna do to have the standard work.

Do we have thoughts there? So in terms of, the service ID itself that is, support for some way compatibility that is specified in the draft. It's if that's what you are referring to.

I I'm not aware of any intention of for any reason at this point to change the service that I value, again, because of the reason that compatibility is kind of provided.

There's also accessory information as part of a gap service. And there's actually a UID for that gap service too which we could reuse if we wanted to. We did add a protocol version into that that, accessory information So we could tie that back Delt protocol version and have that numbering, allow us the specification that allow us to do different things based on that. The other thing that's probably relevant is keeping the header really small was one of our early constraints or early design goals, because a large part of the Bluetooth advertising only being 37 bytes in total including the MAC address, you if you wanna put a public diversified key with good security properties. You end up using a lot of that. Full MAC address, for full, advertising payload. So we try to keep ahead of really, really tiny to allow for the payload to be but small Yeah. Great. Thank you. So just 2 follow ons from that. So it's great that we have, you know, the versioning in there. Have we done explicit tests with Yeah. IOS, Android, other implementations, of things that are version, like an unspecified version to make sure that you know, nothing on the other devices around, like, goes wrong when they start seeing Dolt version 25.

So that we don't have to do custom implementation for different manufacturers, but I guess we will also Once contribution from manufacturers to in in the in this process, right, we will hear from them.

This is more for completeness. Alright. So here's, you know, a proposal, not not wedded to this, but trying to get, something started. Instead of one massive document, I was thinking maybe we could consider. 4. One could be on the crowdsourced finding network. Our texture that would cover items 1, 2, 9, and 10 on the previous slide. We have another line item and a charter on the unwanted tracking kind of reference based on the algorithm, that can be a separate document, covers item 3 in the previous slide. And then, maybe the 3rd document will be a protocol between the accessories and nearby devices including data formats, that would include items 245678 on a previous slide, And then finally, it's clear we need a an overall adult right, model document, and that probably could be separate from the above ones.

And, kind of pull up the bits and pieces that are most valuable and relevant, and put that into document 3. The adult data format document that also talks about the interaction between the accessories and the, nearby devices. Some example sections from that existing internet draft that I think are relevant in helpful. Again, is like starter sections for this document number 3. Are there's a whole section on terminology that kinda tries to clear up what we're talking about. We could hopefully reuse most similar most to that. The advertisement format I get is a great starting point, the MAC address and the behaviors of the MAC address, how it has to rotate, some Bluetooth, very Bluetooth specific stuff on the types of MAC address to use. A lot of consideration that in the existing internet draft along with, some justifications as to why we chose to put certain things in there. Think that's a really good starting point then on accessory info, this would be everything from when you've you detect the accessory traveling with you then you have to, learn more about it and this would This today includes things like the make and model, the accessory, the protocol version, the network ID it's running on. The capabilities it supports does support play sound and NFC and Bluetooth. Serial number lookup or is it just support you know, something slightly different and then finally, so the the the spec talks, obviously, internet draft talks about both the commands and responses too. Along with the formats for all that.

Now the reason I think document number 1, the crowdsourced finding network architecture document is really important and important to you early in this process. Is it's been called out a number of times and, you know, I I fully agree with the statement. The reason I wanted tracking is a concern is because these crossroads binding networks work so well. Getting a really solid description of how that works across responding network works. And having the privacy and security requirements that, etcetera. Really well documented.

How does this proposed work plan which of which of the which of the use cases that we heard would be improved by which which documents and, you know, like, How how does this how does this mesh?"

    "text": "Thank you. Good question. I think if you go to the previous slide, what we talked about, what what the the second presentation talked about was really, aspects of the threat model. And maybe there's scenarios in there that we wanna talk about. So that would be document number 4. In in my opinion, and I as I was speaking through these slides and thinking about this and listening to the earlier presentation. Probably makes sense to do document for pretty early on in this process too, but maybe we could It's it's four documents. They're just not maybe numbered sequentially. Yeah. Exactly. There's no implied or or explicit order are, chronological order mentioned here beyond the the fact that I wrote 4 bullets. Hector? Decker. Yeah. Thank you. Hi, Brent. Probably closer probably closer together than than than than anybody else in this room. They're still in California. So, the So I think which, document would specify. So I guess, you know, in the current in the current type design. Right? There's a public key in the, in in in the broadcast, message. And then the, and then, like, in arc 9, you and say for your location or the public key, we're we're stuck in this set. We just, I think, would specify whatever took that, took a place of that, or was that, whatever. Probably document 1 Okay. Yeah. Because it's document 1. I mean, the crossroads finding network needs to include some description of how you pair. Okay. Yep. Okay. So I think I think on so I think I think it's a good a good our reasonable decomposition, at least. I'm I'm, you know, I I these cuts are never very clean. Some sure will find their problems. I think I would prefer perhaps not perhaps you don't wanna use the word, architecture here quite so much."

And so I don't know, like, may have a little architecture, we we should have in mind, but, like, in this case, we must like, at least at least some wire format somewhere, and like what the, what the mechanics are. So as long as we as long as as long as that's the concept, it didn't play Yeah. That sounds good. Christine? Hello? Hopefully my video is coming through. Yep. I just want to I guess, kind of volunteer for for document 1, a done a lot of reverse engineering and research on the Find My Framework so I I would love to contribute to that document especially when it comes to Endpoint authentication in a privacy preserving manner. I know that there's a lot of concerns about endpoint authentication And then with that authentication, is whoever owns this protocol, Apple, or whoever able track those end users. And so there are private privacy preserving methodologies that can be used that both preserve the privacy of the endpoints, but then also prevent unauthenticated, endpoints from leveraging that Find My protocol or any other crowdsource protocol. So I think, that's gonna be a really important tenant for me in participating Awesome. We will note your name in the minutes. I would also like to note what what I was gonna say would it be great if we get somebody who's written a lot of RCCs to pair up with with anybody who volunteered in Christine, echo through his name in the ring. So Yeah. So I just he he put it in the notice that I'm also happy to help with document I'm have I'm happy to pitch in if people want Well, I mean, I think it's helped to press the buttons. Do this. Do that. Yeah. That that's all I'm really looking for. So that that's awesome. Thanks. Great. Thank you. Wild success, because that's what I was afraid that no one was gonna wanna volunteer. Alright. So I was just gonna go on to the last slide there."

    "text": "Or number the next slide? Yeah. That that sounds great, Sean. So so last thing I want to touch base on is, I've heard I know a number of people have heard, concerns both with within IETF and in other discussions with advocacy groups, gender based violence groups, domestic abuse groups, etcetera, that that and we heard a bit today too. That the non technical communities are super interested in engaging in this work They would love to participate. They'd love to help out. They'd love to influence it. But the fact that they're they're not super technical has has made it discouraged or or you know, not not a well encouraged people to to participate. It's it's a challenge you look at the crankcrank Internet traffic is very, very detailed, very specific. Know, because we wrote it they mark to the point of making sure accessory makers can build something. That works and and written written it for that audience, but it is not for, not even digest if you're nontechnical. So This is more of a hate brainstorm wanna have a few starter ideas on how to best engage and make sure that whenever we're producing is digestible able to be, you know, improved upon critiqued, etcetera, by by everyone who's interested in this area. Maybe maybe there could be a separate document explaining concerns around gender based violence, etcetera. Maybe that's the threat model document, but maybe that's a an addendum. We could add explicit considerations to all the documents that kinda clarify what we mean by some of the technical language we could even have, a primer that kind of explains all the stuff in a little bit less hyper technical jargon. To kind of facilitate engagement and help make sure you understand some of the nuts and bolts. I wanna open this one up, though. This is this is just a starter, and I've got a dog"

My idea here is that, some people have volunteered earlier, and they're gonna help we're gonna use a Rolodex from Erica. We've got this, GitHub repo that we'll be able to not only store, internet drafts that use Martin Thompson School template. We'll be able to actually put other things in there that can do translations from nerd speak to regular people speak and put pictures and training and all kinds of other things in there. And so I'm hoping that we can leverage the community to come help and do the translation for us. But that's kind of my plan is that we we can have one central place that we could do this. That would be great. And not everything has to end up in an internet draft, but, It does help to put some of it there, but I do think you're right that in engaging with the, the wider community to actually get input is one of the things that's in our charter. And so we are going to lay in there. I see Malorie's in the queue and Erica. I don't know. It's might be super late where you're at. So if you wanna jump in and add some more, feel free to as well. just wanted Yeah. Yeah. I oh, sorry. I do wanna just say to I say that there there has been some work done to start some more plain language. Like, information to really engage the broader community of victim service advocates and help them really think through the scenarios. I mean, there's they're seeing this happen. But getting them to understand the work of this space that there there has been some, worked on 6 come at come at documents, and I think that can also help with document number 4. Mallory, Yeah. Thanks thanks for all the present patience, and I wanted to jump in on this just for folks awareness. In the Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group, there's a document"

So I'm just encouraging folks to check that out to see if it fits. I mean, my I actually came with a question, which is What's in scope and what's not. I think is really important to engage. Communities from, outside the IETF on this, I think the work done to do this so far has been Really great, and I'm so happy to see it. And I hope it can continue to expand. But at what point do we sort of diverge from the goal, which is to make sure the standardization happens and also support the, resources and clinics and other places out in the real world that are building these tools and rather point to those, and try to exchange that dialogue. So I guess I'm just asking, you know, where are we gonna draw the line between creating these documents as part of the working group that's happening here rather than doing it in other contexts, and then, you know, just specifically wanted to point to some of the work that's already happened in the IETF related to that that you could reference Thanks. So I guess my off the knee jerk reaction is, it's gonna be a work in progress. We gotta get started and then figure out where the boundaries go. So I'm hoping to not step on too many toes and take what we can and move from there. Nick, I I think Erica already mentioned Yeah. that the sort of in input side, that there has been some work by advocates and, and others to help them to to try to have places to to gather inputs so we can get some of that data"

And and I do think that it's just kind of a new that's that's a new way to think about that. And, and certainly to get the input effective, you're, you're gonna need some, you know, maybe not the most high fidelity, but you need some version of of that output. W3C has used explainer documents. I don't think that's necessarily non technical communities, but it is often a sort of translation down to an easier thing to read. So, maybe we should be thinking about Yeah. Each each time we publish a new a new revision, we also try to published the plain language, a plain language explanation of it, That that sounds hard, but, may be also worth trying I'm not sure how well the IETF will do that, but we can certainly try to take a stab at it. Mean, at the end of the day, we have done know, explainers, blog posts. I'm looking at you, Greg. And other things to try to do things, but I'm also kinda hoping to rely on some of the, you know, companies in here that have people who do this professionally, and maybe they can come and help do that kind of stuff too. Because at the end of the day, you don't you do wanna show that the he moved the needle and and trying to reduce harm. So I think that would be good. Alright. I got 2 more slides. We drain the queue. Let's go to the next one. Is that alright, Brent? The last two slides are just Questions. Yeah. Questions and you. thank Sorry. I ended that early. Maggie. Hi. Yeah. So I was just wondering if we could talk about"

    "text": "kind of the order of operations and and dependencies because I think that it's gonna be hard to, be able to say how the how some of the architecture should be designed or the tracking only should be dying, but the protocol should be designed. You don't have the threat model yet. So I was just also kind of a point of information like how other workers have handled this in the past because I don't think I it makes sense for everyone stall while we try to make a document, but also wanna make sure that you don't get too far down, and then it's hard to change it. Because it's kind of people have put a lot of work into it. So the IETF does it, many different ways, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. There's oftentimes they'll go through the whole process of doing, you know, full up engineering approach where we'll do do use cases and then requirements in the designer protocol you find out the protocol doesn't meet all the requirements, and you gotta go back and change the use case and the requirements get changed. Sometimes they just do the protocol. So I do think you're right. Like, I think the idea is that we will probably try to launch off and go forward and try to mean, at the end of the day, we have to have something down for document number 4. Before we can make sure that 1, 23 make any sense. So while I don't think it's a gating function, I think we can get up and move out, and the ideas that the author teams of these documents are working together in this working group when we're all communicating effectively as possible. And, We basically just try to make the best of a you know, rolling herd of, IETFers right in documents. So that's the I I think the like, we can't do 1, 2, and 3, and then do 4 at the end, like, 4 has somewhere at the very beginning. And I knew that was gonna get people in line, so great. Ecker. Do you wanna add something? I think what I mean, roughly what you said is the only real way to proceed. I guess I would add, that, you know, already have, like, like, a bunch of materials are even written and some protocols that are a veteran, like, are, like, some extent to pull the very widely deployed as such as I'm a set to play that"

    "text": "which I mean, I don't know exactly how exactly how much, you know, we position to play this with the specification we have in front of us. So, you know, I I I think You know, There are, perhaps, you know, 2 ways in which the specific agents can be improved. You know, one is a video thing specification does that bad and we should stop doing them. And the other thing is me is specification specification doesn't do things is insufficient in some way. It would be great. I think to identify the areas in which specifications are bad and stop doing them as soon as we possibly can. And then identify and then if we identify roughly the areas where you think it may be insufficient, and we're gonna need some space. You know, as well, but I think, you know, that that much, I I suspect much of it much of this overall structure of his specifications will stick around And so, you know, that that and that probably needs a refinement. I think, you know, there's plenty plenty of work to do but, as sort of Maggie said, you know, it's it's important to be agile in case, you know, we discover like, later on that we're doing something insufficient. But I don't think there's like a dearth of work to do in the short term. Alright. up Tommy Poly, Apple. Yeah. So, I mean, thanks to Maggie for bringing this overall point about ordering. I agree with what I've heard so far that you know, the threat model matters before we could ship anything. We should start it now. It doesn't block anything. And particularly, think we can look at other examples of work in the IETF that have been successful where you have a starting product. I'm thinking of quick here. Right? Like, Someone came in with a protocol that Worked. Didn't have all the properties, but it was like a a thing that you could run. And then over time, it evolved into something that, you know, achieve the same goals had a you know, much more robust threat model than other things taken into account with it. And, you know, ended up being kind of totally different than the first thing, but also spiritually the same. And it evolved over time. So I think we could have a similar thing here. We have our initial work we take the pieces we think are the right starting place"

    "text": "but we expect that they will be molded along with the threat to to model document and others. Over time. And it'd be nice as, you know, since there is a precedent here of existing tracker networks and people able to run a version of adult to be able to do incremental changes to that culty at each stage have something that people can continue to test and continue to validate. And see how effective is this thing beyond just theoretically what is the threat model? Just for those who don't remember the very first decision that the IETF made about quick, was to change the that that ordering this of the Indians so that they were completely interoperable on day 0. Not interoperable. I seem very on that point about drafts, if it has to somebody has to spend 2 and a half 1000 for each Internet draft, that would be kinda funny. But, so I got to say is on the idea of the scenarios feeding into the threat model document, I don't know if, the people who wrote that this scenario's text also have some ideas about What would reduce the harm? If if it was, you know, if if they were happy to kind of write text about that as well. That might be useful because it could be that, you know, some engineers will I made this protocol change that reduces the harm and the people who are who know about the scenarios might not agree. They Oh, no. They volunteer. didn't they didn't know it. They volunteered to help help that. No. So so, well, I think the scenarios presented earlier, we're very good. But there there was no text at least of our saying, And here's what a less harmful scenario here's how that scenario could be improved from a human point of view as opposed to just from a taking a protocol point of view, DKG?

That was dealing with browsers and web servers. Mainly. And there's a pretty clear straightforward migration, deprecation, Model there. And this doesn't smell the same to me. Maybe I'm wrong. Tell me I'm wrong. It it it Oh, take yourself out. Alright. Jesse? Can people hear me this time? Yep. Oh, good. So I just wanted to, briefly address the, the question of the participant who was asking about the scenarios and suggestions for W would a Miller since since I roots in marios, and I, I talked a little bit about this in the chat sidebar, but I know that there's tons of comments going by, I, I, I think the the point of the scenarios to a large degree is to get people thinking about how to adapt, threat modeling methods to this particular space much like in, you know, in the data privacy world. They kind of took, concepts concepts of things like persona based threat modeling, from cyber from traditional cyber security, and figured out how to, figured out how to adapt, to the data privacy base. So now those tools exist. And I think that kind of approach,"

Thanks. Tell me, Faye? Hi. I just got up to respond to DKG about the, I I think, by comments for evolution of the protocol. So Yes. What I was imagining was, you know, referring back to when I had asked questions earlier and, you know, Brent said, oh, we have some unit tests or you're like a test lab. Like, not actually trying to update the whole finder networks for every drafters or anything, but you know, if people are doing some tests with some fake devices to see, you know, can I model this out can I do things as we have different versions of the spec going along? We can do testing there, and we can imagine that evolving. I'm guessing the actual big networks are just gonna, like, have what they're doing today, as this initial proprietary version, and then there will be some big switch at the end of the day to the standard version. But in between, you know, we should be able to do some simulations models other tests that don't actually involve updating everyone's tracker devices. Brent, I think he might get the last word here. Yeah. Oh, not intentionally, but thanks."

There's also exceptionally long tails you happen to lend something to someone and it's in a you know, it's it's in a faraway place from your device or it's up at your second home or whatever or just that don't come in contact and very often, we could see see very long tails in those from roughly processes. And then more so on the finding network side, you know, the performance of those networks is directly proportional to the number of devices that support the particular protocol that you're using. So we could you can easily imagine years if you did a whole whole hog switch from one protocol to another to get to the level where you wouldn't have a substantial regression in end user performance for the you know, the people just wanna find their stuff. So those are those are very important concerns for this working room to consider Okay. Great. Well, I think we've drained the queue. We got a plan to go forward. We'll circle with people who have volunteered. And we will get going on that. Don't know if you wanna add anything additional, Erica. I I guess, you know, closing, I I just wanna say thank you for first conversation. There is clearly lot to talk about here. I think it's always important to kind of I'm on a note to just pull us back for just a hot second and and just see the bigger picture here. Because there are so many details to be figured out.
