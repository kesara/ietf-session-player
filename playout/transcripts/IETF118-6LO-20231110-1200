Hello, Georges. That's, very helpful. Thanks a lot. And also Lohan has expressed that he will also be helping So thank you very much. This is really useful. In recall that as usual, we will be using Edge Doc to take minutes you can find the link at the end of the slide. And and everyone, feel free to join and contribute also to the process of taking minutes. Then as in the last few IETF meetings, there are also few tips for this one for in person participants. Please make sure that you sign into the session by using for example, you may use the on-site tool, which is available from the data tracker agenda. Remember that you need to use SMIT echo to join the queue because there's a single unified you, which is managed from. And then, also blue sheets are automatically generated from So if you haven't done so yet, please do join the Miteshco session. Also for remote participants, just keep your audio and video off unless you are presenting. Well, this is the not well. Perhaps you have already seen it several times. Already at this point of the week. Anyway, recall that this is a reminder of IETF policies which are in effect the number, the number, of important topics like patents or code of conduct. So please make sure that you have read it."

This will be followed by a presentation by Pascal on ipv6 and the prefix registration. Then the next presentation will be given by myself on the topic of transmission of she compressed packets over 15.4 networks. Then there will be a set of 2 presentations given by Rudi. The first one is the base document for path aware semantic addressing for LLNs. And the second one is a related draft. Entitled generic address assignment option 46lopan in the Then the last presentation will be given by, young one on the transmission of ipv6 packets over short range optical wireless communication. So this leads to a total of 75 minutes of allocated time. Perhaps you may recall that we requested the 90 minute session, but instead we got 120 minutes. So we have ample time. So perhaps it won't be necessary to rush as much as in other previous meetings, and let's hope that we can use the time available for discussions. Other than that, is there any comment on the agenda? Okay. So next is the report of the status of working group documents Since the last ATF, we have 1 new out of sea, That's I've seen 9453. On 6 low applicability and use cases. Congratulations to the offers. And many thanks to everyone who has contributed in the process with comments, reviews, and so on. This has been quite a long journey.

Pascal is mentioning something, in the chat Pascal, do you want to to say something Well, I just saw the message very on the chat, but I did not see his email. I don't know. So so that's why it was, surprised that there was a need for our revised ID, but if there is an email, In the six remaining list, I will find it, and, I will work on it. Yeah. So the the message was sent just few hours ago, not one day ago. So, yeah, it's actually quite recent. Yeah. So now the the document is in revised AD needed. After the comments by Eric. Okay. So then there are 3 other working group documents. Which are at earlier stages. First, we have the path aware semantic addressing for LLNs. Has been updated since the last IETF. It's now at version 3. Then Also, the transmission of sheet conference package over 15.4 networks has been updated currently at version 04. And the last one is ipv6 and the prefix registration. Which also has been updated since the last ATF, and it's currently version 1. By the way, there will be a presentation for each one of these last 3 working group. Documents later today.

So, this is refresher on the, 6 flow prefix registration. So, as you all know, this is a, a family of Arab sees, which deal with, how the host gets signal to the router that it pounds, or it which it wishes to own on the trust. And, we have extended that the capability to expose that traffic for, an anycast or a multi cast address. And with this draft, which is which was, adopted for the LASTA ATF We are now allowing the host to to Claim. To the router that it wishes to receive all traffic for a particular pre x. And this is kind of timely. Yes. I will show in the last slide because there's a lot of work now on how to to delegate prefixes to the hosts. Okay. So the whole age areas Yes. The host may, wish to have not only addresses, but a full prefix. And there is a need for the raters to know which prefix the host"

There is the old that node, option, which, which is like twenty years old and, and explained that, a host can can have a network inside and some recursive model of a host inside a, a network inside a host the host inside that network, etcetera. Then there is the use case of capabilities where today mostly, you know, Kubernetes supports these 6. But but It's mostly used in, in the case of before 1, what you wanna do is, pretty much litigate us, slash 96 by price. I type ipv4real and keep them isolated using ipv6 but, maintain a flat ipv6 routing as opposed to using but all those encapsulation and the relays that you find today. And then, you you you could effectively, the case which is more like a the the home network type where, you have a gateway inside a home network which has its own prefix, but would like the devices in, in the home network to be able to reach that prefix. And one way to do that is to effectively tell the the real home gateway, the main home gateway, that this additional gateway as these prefix. And then again, what's needed is an an abstract technique which would not depend on which type of protein protocol runs in the network. For this host or or this gateway be able to advertise to to the main router, a, I have this prefix if there is any traffic for that prefix, please, give it to me. Last, but not least, we we found something which I I consider a bug, in in some APs where"

    "text": "If you delegate a a a prefix to the host and then the, The IP is supposed to send The packets to the MAC address of of that host because there's not seen any in the operation on on the address effectively because it's the whole prefix that that belongs to the host. The the AP decides to to drop the back end, which is a very, very, very sad and bad idea. But, Basically, if that the AP knows what is there by snooping in the and if there was a method like this, that the AP could snoop then it could effectively figure out that truly the this route should go via this host and then it would not drop the Well, I mean, it should never do that anyway, but since it's there and people find it interesting to do it. It's not asking me why. At least we would have a way to signal them, hey, this prefix is okay. For this host. Now once the host registers the prefix to to the routing what the ratcheting does with it is up to the ratcheting. I mean, it could be just brought CND or or that could be, a slash 48. That encompasses this slash 64 and as as long as the the host stays within the domain where this, slash 48 is aggregated. Then it's perfectly okay for this host to retain this prefix. So mobility is is, an important game here. If you opting a prefix somewhere and you want to move to a different link, arguably, you have to obtain a new prefix, meaning that you have to remember all all the addresses that were derived from that pre checks. And and that's a sad idea because we know we are not too good free numbering in general. So it would be a lot better if the host could just move to this different link within the same domain. Be aware that it is the same domain and tell the raters, a, please now advertise this slash 64 that I was ended."

So with my new link local that I just formed in this new link, And now the the the there was there was a point on the self mailing lists saying, yeah, it would be nice to have this. And guess what? We we almost have it. And that the the key effectively is to be able to prove that the, the host effectively owns the authorized meaning it is the host to which DHCP has handed the prefix if it's DHCP. So bottom line to to where we are With this draft, we have a way for a host or a node. To advertise to the local router I I have this prefix. Please If I said the arbiter, advertise it in whatever routing you're doing, meaning The host doesn't need to know what tracking protocol is happening in the domain And, conversely, the router doesn't need to know how the host obtain the prefix. Now there could be policies in a in a network where, effectively, the host can only get dedicated prefixes in which case the possible to to go to the DHCP server and validate that the delegations happened. But then there is a need to prove that this effectively is host And and we'll see in the next slide that that that it's effectively possible. Now one key element here is that the host, all the server. It is in the case that's drawn here. Has the capability to decide whether to inject the self, for instance, if it's a ripple of where node. It may decide to inject the route in repo by itself. The other hand, if it's like, this, this server in, in, cloud network that represented here. It might decide don't know how the the the routing happens in this cloud I've connected to So I will just set the orbit in the arrow to say Please interrupt."

Now, I'm sure many of you have have heard about it, but there is a lot trucks and a lot of attention at basics ups and and com and but 6 months as well because there is a related draft about, the FCP PD power device. So why do you think, hey, this device needs a lot of addresses or if there are, Other devices that are either to this first device or there are machines and the device, etcetera, which is more like the case I just represented before. It would be very, very cool for for the host to get, the prefix. And so this is what this this accepts draft, discusses and presents and, Like I said, I I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of desire for this to happen. And personally, I do desire heavily that this happens. We my point here is that this draft is a perfect companion to to the work on, DHCP device. Kussohijer is today, there is this, this kind of missing link between 8. HCP has handed the prefix and the vaccine protocols that operating that domain on the aggregation where the 64s. Are aware and there is the right route that is injected and moved as the node moves. And if you remember, the the 6 man, architecture document that we have started, there is this desire to, to be able to move and address within the domain. And I think a routing protocol with pow. Particular capabilities more on the mani side to be able to follow the address. Well, the same concept up and exactly here with a prefix, if you're able if a host is able to inject the prefix to the first router,"

    "startTime": "00:18:00",
    "text": "Then the SGP, the subnet gateway protocol, that runs within the subnet would also be able to track the prefix as the device notes. So I think this capability to to a expose the prefix where the host is to move the prefix as the host move. That is a very good companion to to the capability to delegate the prefix in flies. And so here's the example of flow of, how this would this would happen. So What what typically happens when the the the hosts, so so in our case, it's a 611, figure that it could be a a server in a cloud network that represented earlier or it could be a phone or anything. So what it does is after it has found that the FCP server or through the relay, it will make a request for, APG basically get getting a prefix delegate And if there is a relay, the relay will, forward that to the DHT server. And the idea right now with the physics of graphs is is, the the realized notes the reply, and if there are more than 1, set up and burn our case at the many of them, they all have to snoop the reply meaning that needs to be as many relay for, then they really replies as there are routers, which is kind of inconvenient. And then the the the reply in which I wrote free play totas. Which is the the, the host. Now the host knows that, it can use these prefix, but not we've done here, what we've done is We we have used the the rover or the the route of the the, ownership very, very fine. You're basically the the the thing, the the token that we built for, I see 8928. Which is formed out of a key pair that the the 6l has spawned, meaning that the rover is something that the 6 ln can prove it homes."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:20:02",
    "text": "We already use it with rsc8928 for hosts What we are doing here is we are extending this concept to prefixes. Meaning, when you do an IPD, the device unique ID So device ID will be set to the wrong And so the DHCP server will remember the the device ID for when she gave this prefix. So now it stores the rough that means is when the 6 registers your trust. Or moves and registers a gear As part of the year, you will expose the rover. Ailed, what the 6 are off can do is to to use a a list query to the DHCP Server And the the the discovery reply contains the the device ID, so the device unique ID. So with this, the 6 set off can check with the DHCP server that This prefix was effectively associated with this DUID And that kind of serves as equivalent to the, the the request that we normally do, with with this software registrar that we have in 6 of LNG. So this This, basically, validates that she has this prefix has been, allocated and guess what? The unique ID to which it was allocated is this. So what's left for the 6 LR is to validate that effectively the 6LN owns that forever. And for this, we can use the the round trip exactly like It is defined in 89.6. So so the the DNA as a status validation requested with analysis and the, the the host, the 6lm, does the second registration, but this time, it contains"

    "startTime": "00:22:00",
    "text": "the the notes from the 6LR, its own nouns, additional information that is signed with the private address from which the rover was derived So now we have we have this host, which is effectively a probably the host that does opting this prefix from the DHCP server, and it does not depend anymore. On the link local address. It's the DOD that serves as proof. Meaning that if this host now moves to a different place, It will retain its private key. It will retain the UID. So it's it's able to prove that it owns the prefix throughout its mobility inside the domain. So basically, this discussion does not really depend on whether it's a 6 4, longer than 64, shorter than 64, whatever. It's it's It's not depend on the prefix size and slash 128 is just It's just a specific case of this. But basically, whatever we've been doing for hosts, is effectively exactly the same for prefixes, meaning that we can prove the ownership we can move. So what we really miss to have this flow up an executive like this, is maybe something in DNS to signal that the prefix was obtained for the HCP. So the the the 6LR can effectively know it needs to do a least quarer. But maybe there is already a policy which says, hey, if a host claims a prefix. And you know, I'm doing it is is the FCPPD. So go and and check the server. So it's not really needed, but if we wanted to, yes, we could have this flag in DNS to say, hey, this is a DHCP address. Or or this is forms to another what did the other way? At the moment, we really want to keep that diagnostic, the 6LR doesn't know where the prefix come from,"

Next, please. So first of all, a quick reminder on, what we are trying to do in this document the slide, you can see 2 protocol stacks. The one on the left corresponds to the traditional 6 loop and based protocol stack, 4 devices running on top of 15.4. So in that case, you can see that below ipv6, there is 6 low pan, which performs among other functions, head of compression, and also fragmentation. So what we're trying to do in the document is to enable the protocol stack on the right which, as you can see for head of compression would enable the use of as the mechanism for for that to compress the headers of ipv6 and perhaps also UDPN CoAP. While still keeping cyclopan fragmentation. So here, she is the main product of the LP 1 working group. It's specified in RFC 8724. And the expectation is that it can provide a greater compression degree so better performance, from that point of view. And the trick is that it is based on exploiting a priority knowledge of the header field values of the package that will be transmitted. And that would be stored in some context at the compressor and the compressor 6,"

Which contains several additions and updates. Mostly intended to address the comments from both Kieran and Georgios, by the way, thanks a lot to both for the comprehensive reviews and many useful comments. And they'll saw, minor update, which is 04, which incorporates some of the feedback that was received, from the sheik working group interim that was held in October 17, where this draft was also presented. Next, please. So first of all, regarding the table of contents on the organization of the document. There are a few updates in section 3, there was 3.1 entitled protocol stack until the previous versions up 202. However, now it's plural. It's protocol stacks. Because now it includes 2 subsections, 311 focuses on the main protocol stack that I was showing couple of slides ago. And the second one, 312 illustrates what we call transition protocol stacks which would be those where 6 low pan had the compression is still used compress ipv6 headers, but then she is used or can be used to compress Appleia protocol headers as you will see later. Then we've also added section 3.3 on single hub communication. This one is actually quite short. However, it was missing. And the last update, in terms of table of contents is that the summary table, which was previously at the end of section 3 has now been updated and also relocated now"

Next, please. So now let's go through the updates in, the actual content of the draft. So First, we have one update in the introduction. This is after a comment by Georgios, and It is about the what is the typical size of the UDP Compressed Heather by using RFC 6282. So, previously, we mentioned that that size is four bytes. However, it's true that, the UDP checksum can be compressed in some cases. So now to be on the safe side, what we indicating the text is that, the typical UDB complex compress header size would be from 2 to 4 bytes. Perhaps the the question is what is actually more typical, maybe 2 or maybe 4 bytes actually feedback on that would be really useful. But, yeah, perhaps the text as it is is just aiming to be safe. N consequence, we also mention that the typical ipv6 UDP Compress had a size with RFC 632. Can be down to 6 bytes with link local addresses, this was in the previous version. Now we say from 4 to 6 bytes, And for global addresses, it could be down to 7 bytes Although now, we have updated that to say 5 to 7 bytes. Any comments Okay. Next please. So in section 312, as introduced before, we illustrate which are the so called transition protocol stacks"

So, 1st of all, it is possible to compress co op headers by means of chic. We have RFC 8824, which enables that. And actually, there are the 2 options, that are shown on the slide on the right, what we have is that she compressed co op messages can be carried on top of DTLS. And also it is possible to have, the option on the left, which is not using DTLS. However, recall that RC 8824 also allows to compress also o score if that is used for protection of, end to end payloads in CoApp Next, please. Oh, Yeah. No. Yeah. Thank you So, the other transition protocol stack that is still included here. Is, the one where 6 low pan is used to compress, the ipv6 headers, but then she is used to compress UDP and co op headers. Well, so far in previous versions of these drafted, draft, draft, this document itself was defining, was enabling this, but now, recently, the working group architecture draft has been defining functionality, which actually covers what is shown here. So It's likely that in the future, it's in the chic architecture draft that any functionality needed will be defined.

In the previous slide, you with the stack where you have a And you mean, two two slides ago or in Oh, no. This is this was the one before I see. So slide number 7, can we maybe switch to that Yes. On this one. So it's because you want to recognize the IP address for defining which is, which indicator will be involved. That's what you say. No. The point is that, in in this document, we were defining, like, Everything needed to try to enable doing what the protocol stack shows. But now it seems like the sheik architecture draft is starting to include functionality, which of of of of enables that. So Probably in this document, we will in future versions, just need to refer to what is Actually, the content in the chic draft. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Then, the next slide please. Yeah. So we've added this section on single hub communication, 303. It's actually quite short, but it was missing.

It would start the decimal field, with the shift dispatch, which signals that comes next is the sheet conference packet. And if necessary, there would be some padding in the end. Any common? Yeah. And then Oh, yeah. In the previous slide, the stack that you were showing you're using the, 15.4, but 6 low there is, you know, you can use any link there. So, Right? Yes. I mean, this is, I think 8505 RFC is written there. You can use any link there. So you are specific with this link there device. It's this stack. Yeah. You mean, if if we are specific about using 15.4. Right? Yeah. So, actually, this has been a question in the in the working group. And in the last meeting, I hit this light precisely for that question. And, the feedback from the working group was that it might be better to to focus on one technology, which is, in this case, 15.4. And if there is interest on extending the same to other technologies, similar to what has happened with 6 low pan originally focused on 15 not 4 and then being extended actually in 6 low to other, technologies, then maybe we can also proceed like that.

The second one would be the tunnel repo based route over currently TRO. And finally, pointer based route over would be PRO. So, yeah, anyway, we are open to suggestions if anyone has better ideas for acronyms for for these different approaches, please let us know. Okay? Yeah. Next, please. Then we have some additional content for each section for these 3 route over modes. In the first one, have actually modified a bit, the text that describes how the rules have to be handled, meaning what entities need to store the rules So now we have clarified that all routers in the straightforward route over. All routers must store all the rules. However, a host must store only the roles for its communication with other endpoints. And then after a common from both Kieran and Georgios, we have added some, figures with a network topology showing different entities and, what would be the rules that would be stored, how things would work, So, hopefully, this should help understanding how each mode operates. So in this example, as you can see, there is 3 hosts, a, b, and c, which would belong to this network. And then there's a couple of 6 LRs. There is 16 LDR which connects the whole sheik of team.4 network to the internet, and then also there would be some external host on the right part of the slide, you can see a legend which shows in this example,"

Host the only rule ID 1 and host c only rule ID 2. In, the routers the 6 LRs and the 6 LBR need to store all the rules. As well. Okay? Next, please. Then for TRO, recall this is the tunnel base a ripple based route over. Haven't modified the description of, who needs to store what rules, what rules, but we have added another figure similar to the previous one based on the same example aiming to help to compare between the different modes. So, As you may remember, in this approach. There is an upward panel for transmitting from a node up to the root. Then there's a downward tunnel for just splitting from the root down to the intended destination endpoint. So in this case, for an intermediate node like a signal, it is not necessary to store any rules, So, in this case, as you can see, of for the 6 LRs, they don't need to store rules, but the other entities, the hosts, and the signal VR, they store the same rules as in the previous case. Next, please. Also, there was a comment by Georgios that perhaps for this particular mode, the tunnel, ripple based rollover, it would be good to add some figure like one that is used reference in FC 9008.

So here, we've tried to to follow something like that. With the aim to help clarify how this mold operates. So summarizing a beat, what we have is that for upward communication, the tunnel that needs to be used will start at the first 6LR say, note v. If the 601 is routing unaware or it will start at the sigilon itself it is routing aware, like notes U and S. Or, for the downward routing, the tunnel will end at the last 6lr, if, for example, note x, if the intended destination is routing, unaware 6 of land like q, or, will terminate at the fix the land, like, say note, are if it is routing aware. Next, please. Previous 113, slide 13, Yeah. Thank you. So, for PRO, we've also added the example with the figure So remember that in this case, What is done is that Each sheet conference packet is preceded by a pointer which will allow an intermediate node, like, say a signalr, to find in the she compressed header, which is the ipv6 destination address compression residue so that a node like a 6 alarm that has, no context doesn't store any rule. Still is able to determined reconstruct, which is the intended ipv6"

And the difference is that the 6 LDR only needs to store one role. Like, the 3 in this case, which is that rule that is used for communication with external nodes. So, 6 LBR, needs to store the rules only that are used for communication that involve external nodes. A command by Lohan? Yes. Some something I don't understand in this scheme because if you have a rule 1 and 2, Normally, you we must end at another position application in the network. And so with, because rule 1 is between a and b. That's what you you mean. Yeah. So a a m b extension. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Understand. Ah, okay. Thank you. Yes. Yes. So so rules 12 are used to compress packets, which are not external. So they are internals. So, yeah, in that case, Yeah. Okay. So the the signal VR only needs to store those rules involving communication with external nodes. Okay. So any other comments? Yeah. 1, Yes. A general command on on the on the screen.

Actually, we we started to add content in appendix b, which aims to clarify a bit like, to give a little bit of applicability statement or at least to to highlight which are the features of each one of these three modes. Actually, one question in the previous meeting was whether okay, we have 3 different route of approaches. Do we is it good to keep like like like like all three or what. So then, somehow the feedback was that as long as there's some clear applicability statement, then perhaps it's fine. So quickly summarizing My understanding is that the straightforward approach is suitable, perhaps, for very small networks, simple networks where, as you said, changing context in in the nodes doesn't create, like, a lot of trouble the the good side about that is that about straightforward is that it provides or it incurs the lowest overhead, header overhead. Then the tunnel based route over is perhaps most suitable when there's communication with external modes. If you are handling different possible prefixes as destination endpoints, and, the last one, the pointer based one, is perhaps the lightest one less overhead when there's communication between notes which are internal. And perhaps in special cases, external communication where maybe there's just one possible destination, but that would be like an exception. So, yeah, anyway, I I definitely agree and We need to add also content about, for example, management of the networks. Yeah."

Whether you are doing unicast or multicast. It's the same as. You do demo test only when you come up, in here. The first one you were saying multicast. The second one, MS is the unit cost.

If I may say as well, even the first, multicast errors in practice, is is not intended to be a broadcast. I mean, It's basically, a message which is which is sent to the or rather Month guest address, and the expectation is that That should be depending on your network. There should be something like Either the the first top node is already a router. Which case, it will intercept this packet had not multicasted Right? If you have, for instance, Wi Fi access point, If you send the errors to the Wi Fi's point, the Wi Fi's point being your router, We'll just reply and and note for Now if you have this structure that we have in this path for our network, It could be that the nodes know that to reach this is a this is aimed at all ratably. Maybe they know that the router is at the rooftop of the tree or something. So they they don't fully multicast or broadcast that I get at all. They just forward it other way to the root of this trip.

Thank you for the comment. Thank you. In the next size, please. And then number 5, I just showed you, I said that the educate more case other mapping. This is the address resolution procedure of mapping ipv6numbercastaddresssection 4, 6, the 1, and 6, 7, the 2 of the LFT 40 a, 6 to 1, and the 6th AVR must hit track of the multicast listeners at authorize link level, gravity, and the 6lms always has to send the Mercast pack is through the el the 6 LDR. There is the figure number 5 is the mapping the moment in the Nissan it's left, please. So, technically, it's not just that we have 2 One is, actually, there's hyphenated, the the figure number stick essentially and to it. Maybe I will do the best at 1. So maybe 6 and the direct connect the 6 LDR like that to be the authorization link. And maybe like this, some LED the source to here, and then we can use that. The mobile phone is to connect at that one, like this scenario, but the other one is maybe There are a lot of the mobile phone, they can with can communicate with each other with the the LED like that so we they can't make it"

I must admit I'm a bit confused. Last time I looked at 15.7, this was essentially unidirectional So when you build the subnet You have to build it out of You need rational links and then maybe throw in another technology actually do the other direction And are are you addressing that, or are you assuming it's always by direction. Not by today, actually. No. The the if it's not by the technical problem. Yes, please. Big problem. Okay. I mean, you Sir, I mean, that the yeah. Yeah. No. If if you can make the comments on the main floor, I I've done here. The same, that the Krishnan, said that if it's not bidirectional, then it will be a problem. How can they communicate? You mean that the the the first the scenario if I'm talking to you, yeah, I'm not listening to you. About using the the the services. Right. Sensor in in the in in in the in the mobile phone, do we have the the LED the defenser and that they can they have a TF and Alex maybe we can say, I can show that the the last two slides because they have a listener or they have the they could they be"

If it's bidirectional, You can work. then you can Yeah. No problem. Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Yeah. So as I am under my just for the just a suggestion. Ipv6our short range optical wireless communication. Right? Just just I want a suggestion if you change it with s r o w c. It's okay. Because we have also long range optical wireless communications. No? Carlos. This is like laser, I think, few kilometers. Yeah. We are also considering the short range. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. So perhaps one one point here is that the list politically, let's say, 15.7 is developed by IAAAa22.15. Which focuses on wireless personal area networks, which are assume in theory to be for short range. Although, yeah, perhaps reality is not always like what's theory would indicate. Okay? But at least from that point of view, There's some some some reason why we can call that short range."

With inverted commas optical wireless communication. And the other part of the It's a just editorial thing. Okay. And the other side, you're just using OWC instead of s r o w c. That's the point because okay. It was in inverted commas short range of people who are listening. I got it. That one. So this is Thank you. I think I'll give a comment. So on. Next slide. That's the last slide, surely. So this this individual interest wrapped, actually, the number one is for the IP server of the ROCE that, we reviewed the details of the IPPC over the the the technical issue that detail them. And, for the concentration for the next path, Actually, I I'm concerned that the SCHTC for auto receive will be available. So it's good one. One of the consortium. So the next version maybe I will because of their one, And then Actually, the based on the the current version, actually, pretty much stable as I've entered the the most stable for the the working blue options. So we are planning to ask for the organic off option to fix the working group, the next meeting, Yeah. Thank you. So please delete the draft and the product feed the Welcome. Thank you. This is a comment by Karsten."

And have students, work with this with the research operating systems like riot, And so on, that would be very interesting. Awesome. So if you can, some point us to with the list just as a starter kit for. Yeah. For people to play with this and to actually maybe implement you you're draft, I think we could go ahead and much much faster. Yeah. I think Yeah. Escodak. Just on the other comments, so you were talking about just now about Unity Direct versus bidirectional. I think if the standard is defined, with in mind, like the fear hyperpolice standard, and it's worth to say in the draft that, okay, we we assume that a device will have bi directional link So to just build on that, so you have to basically two links, then, between the points, think that would be a good start. Okay. Garston is now going to reboot the monitor. Okay. It needed some inputs, some human inputs. Right? Thanks. Yeah. Maybe the other, question was, well, when you presented about the fights, the different speeds, etcetera, frame lengths first thought I had, well, at least this 51 is extremely suitable for, yeah, 6 nope on type operation. It's exactly what 6 low is kind of meant to do while fight"

So that's maybe something to think about, But on the other hand, if you think about mesh network, topologies, they could also use these phi 2 or 3 or 51 And if you have a mesh, network topology, then I think it again makes a lot of sense to introduce the cell phone technology because otherwise you have to, yeah, use something else and, something proprietary or reinvent Fasing, So in that case, it's, yeah, still useful to define a six loop on type of technologies for those links, even if the compression doesn't maybe help a lot so that that sort of short thoughts, I don't know what the final answer is there, but, This is something to consider. So, for which links is 6 o'clock actually applicable and why So maybe that's something that could could be added there. So you, can argue why, it's still useful to do open for this device, you know, although we don't know if it will always be used on top of those files. K. That's it. Yeah. Thank you. So this is the last slide. Actually, we had I have 2 more the So slide, I'm sure I gave you the this on previous slides, but same, they show is that I have a test, like, that diabetes Automacy, DCs, the TX and the Alex, they also, they have that we 88 is that they communicate the bidirectional like that. The next one a fly show that It's like, yeah, it's a a kind of a the has the result of the a simple link, but weekend it. They contact each other by. And the next one, actually, I I gave this,"
