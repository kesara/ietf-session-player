We could do reviews collaboratively, just by looking at things and noting places where we are uncertain, or we think there might be something missing or perhaps even wrong. We occasionally get request for cross area review, please also provide that if you can't, if you have any expertise, or if you have no expertise and just simply willing to read it and say you don't understand that also is good review.

And that's why it's something like DTS over SDTP is being discussed or other similar solutions. We are focusing on the requirements from 3 GPP. We are not limiting us to these requirements. So we're possible. We we try to be generic, but the focus is what's needed by 3gpp. Next slide. So we structured these requirements a bit in generic requirements.

That's such that during that period, your communication is limited in that that is to be avoided. The other situation is, have send buffers and receive buffers and implementations. And the size of these buffers should not limit the maximum max message size. So message sizes are an issue. Right now, if you use DTLS over STTP, you are limited by about, I think, 16 k so in in this limit is already too small. So some of something about half of a megabyte is currently being in use, And so this message site should not limit future deployment of these solutions, so it should if possible, support unlimited message sizes if we have to put up a limit due to some limitations, the agreement was that one gigabyte is is enough. So if if we need some limit. Next slide. Functional requirements from STTP are the ones which are covered in the base specification, like audit reliable, reliable transmission of user messages. So, there is right now no explicit requirement for partial liability or unorder delivery, but, multiple streams with audit delivery, multi homing is required, but not the dynamic address reconfiguration.

We need multiple streams, but right now too is what is used. Next slide. Implementation considerations, user message sizes might not be limited by protocol implementation. This basically means that you in the API, you need to be able to receive message is larger than the receive buffer, which is required. By an SCTP implementation, which is called partial delivery, it's an optional feature to have the same on the standard side. And for for the aspect of kernel implementations. This feed this feature is supported by previously, but currently not supported by the Linux kernel implementation.

Need neutral neutral, authentication, privacy, and integrity integrity for user data as normally requires. For a long living sessions, we have some requirements, especially, period reauthentication, and in particular, certificate grades certificate updates have to be, allowed during that re authentication. And it must be possible to run Diffie Hellman once an hour or every 100 gigabytes. So, on a depending on your rate, it's a time limit or it's a volume limit. And the availability, so replay or injection must not affect the availability of an association, which means an on path attacker doing this. Can't affect the association in particular an an an attacker which who's able to perform an STP restart must not be able to affect the communication which means an attacker should not be able perform the restart, take over the SCTP association, and then fail the, to handshake.

And some participants, prefer to use unmodified D TLS implementations.

It doesn't replace slow start. For example, in Reno, it doesn't replace I start plus plus as a modification of cubic. So, is that it's it's a method that is additional to these methods And, what he wants to do is to start as fast as possible by reusing the previous parameters. So going, reusing the good fraction of the BDP that was already been used before in previous connections. So here, we are looking really up connection. That's a very large, BDP bandwidth. So all on the, order of a megabytes So, for example, one of our scenarios is the satellite link where you can have several megabytes. And if you start really from the initial window of 10 packets. It will be only 15 kilobytes. So it will take, a certain number of round trips before using the capacity effectively. So, instead that we, try to jump directly at the level where the the the the capacity can be used effectively. So I reuse the parameter for pest connection is not, a sender side only modification, in the sense that that may be the receiver involved And, one of the options in the draft is to store the parameters of the receiver"

Then we implemented also asked a response, a safe response that we call a safe retreat that try to, undo the the jump and try to have the least impact possible on the on on the transcript. So since the last update of the draft since the last version, we have, done this experiment and we have also received some feedback. And so these modifications are really a reflection of this So the, our first, modification is, concern the data limited connection So connection that don't have really much data sand, and this may happen, for example, at beginning of a connection, the, sender may have to exchange some data. They can always open that to it doesn't have the bulk of data immediately. So several round trip can pass, you know, this data limited connection And, it, it doesn't jump immediately. It waits until the sender us is ready to send the bulk of data.

There are different implementation of, transport rocket it's possible if it's the conjunction window, is decided to stay constant for example, maintaining, the initial window then, also this protocol doesn't affect the control window effectively. Or in my increase, And, in this case, the condition remains.

And, we wait for acknowledgements So, what we want really is that the entire train is acknowledged, not only the beginning and if we will limit this to one round trip, probably we will receive only very few acts because, receive one unacknowledgment after one round trip. If if the data will be sent in a block, than if it will be receiving effectively in one round trip, But because, we use spacing and we aim at using a good fraction of the, round trip time then also the technology are expected to be received with a delay. So we effectively introduce another phase, validating phase where we wait for all the acknowledgement and for to do this, so we need to take the markers of where the data is uh-uh started and 1 is uh-uh completed also, we clarify that that these are additional pocketed that are invalidated with respect to the one that we already sent.

So when we send significant data, but because the the the the the path has changed or there have been a friction or something that's changing the network. So we receive where the the things go wrong and that there are lots of pocket losses. So here, when we talk about, It may be significant pocket blocks. So, and we think many more pocket losses that it will be usually have in the internet. So, we would like to support the things like a 90%, a 95% of pocket loss. So in this case, we have only a few acts and we use the access to try to estimate how much is as passed. So we actually, they use also the acts that we receive to have some knowledge about what the capacity it was. And, so we use a we we estimate the one way is simply to count tax. For example, if I don't have any others, selective acknowledgement information and the only things that can do counting docs.

So that's, that means that this modification can be implemented. So next slide, So the after that, when we, use the pipe size is then reused to reset the congestion window, and we use half of the size. So we have done some experiment. We have implemented care for resume in TCP and in simulation in an s 3, we have done a modification for cubic. And, so we have a a little bit of experience with TCP with this, with this modification, And, really, the TCP is a little bit more tricky than quick. Because effectively TCP as the concept of pocket need to be recorded. So if if I have a massive amount of packet loss, after that today, wind of us increase them, significantly if the the partners change you have only few so what happened is that, yes, I can reset the conjunction window but then I still need to recover, many pockets. So, what we found really is that the, a recovery period that may, be prolonged, and this may have some implication because, for example, in Linux, TCP the contraction, you know, cannot grow during their recovery. There is effectively a phase in the, final state machine of the the the selective acknowledgement that"

So, that doesn't mean that cannot be applied to TCP, it means that, the performance cannot be in this particular case as good as what we could have in quick. So in quick, there isn't this problem because the the reason to effectively our recovery, it's the application that decide what to sand and the re the the act of reducing the congestion window is effectively single act. And then if they, quicker basically mimic, TCP for one round trip so the recovery can only last why I'm prepped and not several run trip as must be done into city. So what we are doing is just that at this point, we are continuing, implemented in quick. So we have received feedback from Kazu and, Neil, there are we we actually modify the draft, to respond to that we we still are in the process of responding to their, to their creduces But, we we are telling it your input now. If, you have question happy to respond about this this test that with none and, the update of this. Thank you for the talk. Questions, please. Michael Dixon, so you said at the beginning that you are storing, values like RTT and the bandwidth delay products. So for how long do you install this? But use this"

So at the moment that the rough dozen cities but we are thinking about, in the range of few minutes So that, is something that, offense, what what when the the the connection is restarted For example, for type of traffic that require, for example, disconnecting and reconnecting to the same server. So in a short period of time, we we think that the condition have not changed So these five means can be for example, seen in other in in other transport protocols. So it's something that we can refer to other protocols. But still, we are something that we we have to think about. And and we have to find the right argument for that. Are the comments on that topic? Are there people, people, I saw a Christian in line. Did you repeat it for yourself? Well, yes. And and then I remove myself. I I can't. Well, What what I wanted to say is that I I am, in implementation, big or quick, I have tried 2 different options. 1 is to take the full, BDP and go straight to the final value And I found that to be the dangerous because, I mean, you never know what could happen. And the other way when I'm still in slow start is just to stick increase the window to half the BDP which means that it will take one one trip to grow to the full BDP, but also it will be safer if the conditions have changed."

    "text": "That's what I'm doing. Yes. So that's, So the the the the the alpha of the BDP is, parameter that we have chosen because, Well, it's a safe, parameter in the sense that, we don't want to reuse the old capacity, then maybe other connection in progress. And, so I'll to avoid that disruption that will happen if you take all the capacity, but is the link is already congested. So we are a little bit more conservative than we use out of the band But we would basically, this uses 1 around 3 to grow back to the We have 2 more people in line, and we have about 2 more minutes So one minute takes place. Yes. I would like to repeat the observation. I made a couple of ITs go that this particular parameter is one that ideally you would actually learn from the network. From the history of how previous restarts went. Whether or not one half was needless lower whether or not one half was dangerously high It's I'm thinking some sort of ML model. For that specific parameter. Thanks much. So yeah. Okay. Right. So for what's last in our implementation, we do full bandwidth with facing rate of 1 x, and it did seem to work well, though I'll point out that in the kind of set of draft, we use serial and previous RTT for estimating the boundaries and that means that we can over estimate my 2x I'm cautionary that I tend to agree that within a draft, it makes sense to say that half the correct filing. Okay. Some feedback, some"

Please continue discussion on the and more people please help developed this spec. Thank you, Ruffalo. Net side deck will be multiclathdccp. With Martin. Marcus. Sorry. Martin's doctoral Sites. Marcus is doing the top. Go ahead, Marcus. Hi. Good evening. My name is Marcus Ahmed. I'm here on behalf of the orders of the multi pass DCCP draft to give you an update on the status. So before this meeting, we published version 11. And this time, we focused on language improvements, big thanks to Gorey, who provided a pull request which fixed a lot of language errors. Or as I said, improved the language throughout the whole document. And, we adopted a pull request which explains or gives some guidance when the sequence number space within the multi pass, sequence sub option is exhausted. That fixed 1 of the issues out of Ye raised in history. In his review, And we are now making progress to fix the last issues we have in the issue tracker. So our idea is to fix this until endoftheyearandpublish all the fixes in the new version 12th, so that the, hopefully, then are ready the working group last call if no new issues. Will appear on the issue tracker. So that is more or less the status, now Any questions?"

You you showed running cold in previous hacker forms for this spec. Is that called still relevant to the latest version of the spec? Still it is. We plan to modify a little bit the hand checking procedure as we discussed, in last IETF, So that requires some changes in in the in the code and the open source code. So we also follow this to keep this aligned. Excellent. Okay. Any questions from anybody? If there's a lack of questions and you're curing issues, then I suspect you will be proceeding to a working group call in the start of the year by the looks of it. Excellent. Which brings us to the end of our agenda Excellent. So we have reached the end of our agenda. We would love you to come back for 2nd helping we will do all the other stuff in the meeting on Thursday. If you have any questions, please come and talk to us please comment on the list. Have a good evening. You for being here. And I want Okay. Thank you,"
