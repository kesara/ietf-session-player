We will go ahead and get started. We wanna welcome you all. We have a couple of talks folks that have traveled all this way to to present today. And then a few drafts at the ends, we'll have a bit of time for a discussion about this research groups, very minor re charter. And an update on that. And I'll come back to the agent agenda in a second we can we can does it review it? K. But before we get started, please remember you need to wear mask unless you're drinking or eating?

I should mention this is on ice cast, streaming live as well. And then we have a privacy and code of contact that are pretty important. But you can read all the details your leisure It will dwell on the code of conduct as usual, that's really important. It's changed in the last few years to include more rigorous definitions of... Like, the anti here harassment procedures and things like that. Right. So the I f has some explicit goals that are separate. From the I etf. We're looking at the longer term issues for related to the Internet. The It is is focused on the the engineering. Standards making that are more short term. Hsbc has been around for several years now or coming up on a I think end decade soon. Not long. We are we are conducting research. We're not developing standards. We tend to publish drafts and documents Some of them are drafts. Some of them are not drafts that are informational experimental. I don't think we've done anything experimental. Just informational. Yeah, giving giving people ideas. I can tell audience. And yeah, if you wanna know more about the Ir there's lots and lots of research groups that have met here this week and it's all documented, and you can read more about it.

Between human rights as a, its own kind of standard framework. Yeah. And the Internet protocols development process. In the protocols themselves. We especially focus in the human rights framework on Freaks Russian for assembly, but we've also talked about privacy, although that's very direct overlap with the privacy research group. And other.

And so in this talk I'm gonna give an overview of the main skills that people need to analyze hacked leak datasets sets, and I'm gonna use a lot of examples from real datasets. So everyone deserves to have the skills to analyze how leaked data that's regardless of their income or what country they're from.

I come across data so frequently that it feels like I'm drowning in data, and there's no way that I'll have time to analyze them all or even most of them for news worthy parts? So here's just the few data sets that have been published by distributed denial of secrets, which is a nonprofit leak archive that I work with? That they made available since the beginning of twenty twenty three? So in January, software and documentation for two different phone forensics companies, celebrate and M were dumped online. And either tools that are the police use to extract data like text messages and emails and photos from phones and they're frequently used against activists and journalists.

Okay. So that's just an example of just how much data there is. There's very few people looking at all of this data that have the skills to do it. So Before you start working on hacked in leaked data this. It's important to start with some baseline digital security skills. And so that's how I am starting the book. So the first part of the book is the least technical, but it's still very important. And so some of the homework assignments includes starting to use as a password manager for yourself, making sure your hard drive is encrypted. You encrypt Usb hard drive, which you'll then used to download data throughout throughout the buck. And then there's also, you know, they're very important part of verifying the data as authentic, you can't believe stuff that you read on the Internet, including big datasets sets that are leaked. And so there's a lot about how to verify authenticity. And then it goes into a lot about how to go about acquiring data sets. Either, like directly from sources and how to securely do it. Or how to download public data that's online. And part of the homework for this is everyone downloads a copy of Blue leaks. Blue leaks was it's a two hundred seventy gigabyte data from twenty twenty, and it contains data from hundreds of long for fusion center websites around the United States. In the middle of the black lives matter protest in twenty twenty, somebody hacked the company that ran this software, that that ran all of these police websites."

So after that stuff general Search should start need to start learning more technical skills. And so it starts the technical parts start with basically the command line interface. So there's a pre prerequisite for most of the tools and technologies that are used that you're gonna need you know, going forward. People who never use the terminal are often kind of a rate of it, but it's it's not that hard to learn the basics. Since so this So I gave a crash course on things like how to use the terminal tab completion, relative and absolute paths, how to use package managers and text editors, simple shell, When you download Blue leaks, it's basically like a few hundreds of files. And so one of the homework assignments is you use a bash for loop to unzip them all on a single command. And so there's, like, a lot of, like, automation that you can do. And also I know that a lot of people use windows and I didn't want to leave them out. So Windows is fully supported mostly using the windows subsystem system for Linux. And, you know, when that's not available. There's other instructions to make sure the Windows users can completely follow along and do all of this as well. So for example, here's a little excerpt from the buck. So this teachers people how to use gru to search through file. And so in this case, the reader had created a file called Blue leak file names dot text. By using find and then piping the output or then red redirecting the output. Into a file"

This is only actually searching the file name themselves, not the content of the files. So gap is great for searching, file names, and it's also great for searching the contents plain text files. So, like, specific types of files like Csv, or Json Files but it doesn't work for most other types of files that you end up seeing like Pdfs or office documents or even emails, emails or plain files, but they're they very frequently use My coding, which means there's a lot of basic before and so you can't So you can't grab base sixty four. Encoded data. So if you wanna search the contents of all of these different files, You can use software called l. Alice is open source investigative software that is developed by Oc, It's the organized crime encryption reporting project. They run their own server that's public at data dot oc c c r p dot org, They have a bunch of public data sets on there and also for journalists they give out accounts and gives you access to even more private data sets.

And using their phones, they all took photos and videos, and a lot of times, they these videos included Gps coordinates nets. In the metadata, and they posted them online in real time. Many of them posted videos to Par, which is Right, social network. So after the January six attack, Parlor refused to moderate content that incite violence. And so bowl and Google band to their apps from the App store, and then Aws announced that they would take they give parlor a few days before they kicked them off the service because they wouldn't remove but think content than violence.

That's like sixty four times the amount of states on the laptop that I'm using. And then she worked with Tickets to make them all available to the public.

So if people see journalism and reporting come from them. Thanks. Lars Yes. Good morning. Lars I. Have a question that's a maybe a bit more technical, but all of your analysis seems to be based basically on leaks of stored data. Dumps. Right? And and in the idea is mostly about the network. I'm wondering if if you have any example of something where somebody took a network trace and analyzed it or or not threat, which would mean that encryption maybe works very well. I'm I wonder of you can sort of talk a little bit of that space. I don't have examples of that, but I do think that, you know, if"

But but, yeah, I think that a lot of the more active stuff. Gets into much more legal gray areas. And so so that's just the depending on what project you're doing, you probably wanna consult lawyers.

I think there's a lot of stuff that happens with geo geolocation data usually, governments are use it against people wonder if there's stuff like that.

I was wondering if you it all about s demographic techniques because even if you red name. And you're like, okay. This is safe. To put out this original document. I learned out the names. Stone graphic techniques could be used against the leak or whistleblower. Do you Yeah. Yeah. So So basically the when you're receive documents, the choices that you make about publishing them are like, from the safest in terms of protecting your source is publish the documents at all. Don't publish images of them or don't quote them. Instead just describe what is in it because that way,"

If you don't wanna publish documents, you can recreate the documents. So instead of if it's audio, you can record audio yourself reading, you know, what what somebody else had said so you don't release their voice. If it's like, text documents, you retake the documents in your own thing. So if there is any sort of hidden watermark or you know, any other hidden information, that won't be included if you reproduce the documents. So... Yeah, there's, like, a whole range of things. Like where the most transparent, but kind of least secure in terms of protecting your source. Is just publishing their own documents. And then the most transparent or the least transparent, but most secure in terms of protecting your source is just not publishing anything. Just describing what they contain. Right. Okay. Thanks.

This is joint work with Sunny. Wanna start with a quote, that crypto rearrange power. And This is true depending on the circumstance, but I think a more accurate freezing of this is that crypto, the Internet other technologies we develop, has the potential to rearrange power. And the sub there is that oftentimes these technology serve to maintain systems of power that already operate and exist. And so this leads to the question, power for whom and to what ends. So this talk invites you to consider the following questions. How do we as people who create and maintain powerful technologies understands the sums of power. How does this understanding inform our priorities threat modeling and design choices. And finally, how might we work toward building power for communities? So in starting to answer some of these questions for ourselves, we came up with a kind of protocol design paradigm shift. The first property of which is a design justice property that one size fits one. So we really have to start our design process. With the actual needs of the population we are trying to serve with our designs. Second, that trust is fundamentally a human property. That digital trust is just an extension of highly complex human trust relationships. And that we wanna to work towards a more holistic notion of threat modeling in our designs that covers"

So this is the overall organization of the talk. We've already looked at the introduction and the paradigm shift. And I wanna give some definitions and historical context next. We define grassroots organizing, as a process by which people work from within marginalized communities, to affect social political, economic and environmental change. And I wanna start the historical examples with an alternate rei imagining of the Internet that took place in Chile. In the nineteen seventies. And the goal of this project was to create a centralized worker owned platform where these networks of tele machines and factories would allow workers communicate things like working conditions and material needs directly to the government. This plan was to be expanded to people's homes as well they would give every planning to give every home a machine. So this didn't... We didn't really see how... Get to see how this would pan out because this was destroyed in the military queue. But it is a a nice example of what the Internet design process might have looked like with a grassroots first, like, bottom up design rather than top down. The second historical example I wanna give is the first known instance of crypto for grassroots or nice. And this is operation, which took place in South Africa. Where activists in the African National Congress created a crypto system to fight against a apartheid. Sonny Cam kumar has a very detailed description of this ing ingenious crypto some in his twenty twenty crypto for the people talk, so I won't go into the details. But I do wanna highlight an activist take on this on crypto here so they said, I went to find out about secure encryption algorithms"

However, I learned a few tricks and use these to develop a them to meet our security needs. So I think this is a really important opinion to highlight that it's not important only to develop protocols. It's also important to communicate and make that knowledge and the design process accessible to the people we're trying to reach with our designs. Next, Call Intel Pro, which was an intelligence gathering in the United States illustrated the extent to which state powers are able to illegally and extensively sur activists. And this also showed the blurring of boundaries between information gathering and physical violence. So the information gathered as part of, led to a assassination for instance of fred Hampton, the incarceration of many other activists. And we learned about the techniques in this operation through the Church Committee report which was leaked and no meaningful oversight and accountability we're you know, this report also detailed no meaningful oversight. And we know that there's digital equivalents have been brought into the the current year via the snow disclosures. Finally, I wanna talk about the Arab spring, which was important for many reasons that as I happened between twenty ten and twenty twelve. And this was really the first time that's social media was used extensively to organize. So this increased speed at which people were able to organize the amount of information they were able to dis and also the number of people they were able to reach about information. And people who study the role of social media in the arab Spring are also quick to label social media facilitator rather than a direct or independent cause of change. And so this inspired countless other movements. And will bring us kind of into the present day, so we'll look at some lessons"

Are facilitated by information technology. And cons and Covert surveillance speaks to the importance of having confidentiality the protection of the information that's being transmitted over the network, and anonymity, the protection of people's identities. Deception and mass media influence speak to the need for integrity of information and also trust. In information that you are seeing online. So the last two sets of properties here are often at odds with each other, and we'll look a little bit at how activists manage this function in the next slide. Censorship is also important mode of suppression as well and speaks the need to have more decentralized networks and also to make access to these technologies more accessible to people. So this first study looks at how anti corruption foundation activists. Manage the trade off between being safe and being visible while organizing. The first observation is that they're using cons security So they're not only using services like tour, encryption and Vpn. They're also teaching people how to use these services openly. They're also using strategic visibility to be transparent in their actions and to create a sense of community. This is echoed in Hong Kong protest where there are bigger public groups and smaller encrypted groups and to join those smaller encrypted groups, there is a rigorous onboarding process with who gets invited into those groups. Next is an observation I made after having fifty conversations with Barclays lives matter activists in twenty twenty. And that observation is that digital trust really reduces to physical trust.

So people were reading things, they weren't sure if the the groups were legitimate, the organizers legitimate they would show up and it would be a space that was a full crowd boys, for example. And so the way that they were combating this is really falling back on their community networks. Word mouth, checking with people, hey, do you know who's organizing this event? And then going in strength the numbers. This was also echoed in Hong Kong. Excuse me. Where face to face proceeded phone to phone because to quote one of this standing on the front line together is very important for trust. Similarly, this a study of activists in Ukraine and during the ur maid uprising, found that they were using physical spaces to aid with technological education and accessibility. So they had physical It tents where they would provide free internet access and also equipment to people. And this was all crowds source. So add hoc groups of people with resources. Not just for technology, but also meals, medical aid, legal aid and all kinds of other protests support. These spaces led to collaboration between technologists and They would gather together, and then eventually, they did develop new needed tech. Out of necessity in these pieces. There are plenty of other censorship circumvent techniques that I'll just briefly look at. For example, when there are network outages, as they were in Egypt. They relied on satellite phones and dial up connections. There was also history of using audio transmission and falling back as well on word of mouths. When things are removed from social media. Physical prep planning is another technique. So the It tense are an example of that and Facebook at Standing rock is an area of worst standing rock in North Dakota like has body cell coverage.

So this increased the effort required to obtain the data as well as providing access to people. So these local the idea of a local physical network not only provides access but also increases the effort needed to out these networks. The final property that I wanna talk about is the importance of device compromised deletion. And this comes from a study of anti extradition law in the mid protests in Hong Kong. The first prop... So that this idea of security is as far and beyond what we normally talk about as compromise security a post compromise security or ford secrecy and crypto. This is really a full spectrum compromise security. So they don't... Didn't only need to manage a key being lost, They also needed to detect whether a compromise had occurred. And they were using software that we might consider Stock aware, for example, life three sixty. To track other activists and figure out whether they have you know, gone outside the normal patterns of their operation and had been arrested. And in that case they were using remote deletion. And they chose telegram in large part because they had these strong deletion properties, even though in other ways, it was not a secure as other encrypted messengers. And this gets at the idea of a collective security culture. So oftentimes we have a tendency to think about security on kind of an individual level. There isn't a collective procedure that we can all engage in and that activists engage to agree as community here the procedures we're going to follow.

And the goal of this project is to use crypto tools to adapt existing trust and communication protocols of grassroots organizers, from physical and to digital spaces. And the goal to do this without increasing the risk of surveillance disinformation and infiltration of grassroots movements. This is not a standalone platform. It's a library of primitives. And it The goal of it is to apply private trust network information to any digital and we'll look out a little bit about how that works. It uses an on the ground key agreement over Qr codes and bluetooth. To root the digital trust in the system in an interpersonal interaction. Contacts hold minimal information about one another and anybody with the shared key can delete And finally, we think about what can be executed on device versus what can be offload uploaded to a server where the datasets sets are relatively small. So the goal is really to establish a security notion that's rooted trust so we're establishing human trust as a core digital security concept. And the way we're doing this is first to recognize that people build trust in all kinds of ways. There is no one size fits all trust on any type of network. So we wanna leave the ability to the organizers to be able to establish trust However, they are used to establishing it. We do this by creating the idea of grounded crypto protocols. So this roots the overall trust in the system to grounded pairs, so it's a pair wise human interaction. And then it allows these grounded pairs to share qualitative trust measurements."

So there no public key infrastructure here. There's no link persistent identifier in the system to link the activist activity over time. And then we're gonna build out of this key exchange with called a grounded annotation system this would let People pairs, share digital and its patients of arbitrary people places and things and especially post events comments that they see in digital spaces, they would be able to apply their trust to this as well. And we're not gonna talk about this today, but we're working towards also grounded trust metrics that are computed privately over your social network graph. Very briefly, the key exchange looks something like this. So these are two activists, code, alice and Bob. They're standing in physical proximity to each other. We model this using what's called an ideal functionality, which is just an ideal way that this key exchange would go. Is if there's not this magical entity that takes the ids in locations and checks whether Alice and Bob in the same location. And if they're in the same location, then this ideal functionality passes them back a key. And they store the key. In reality, this can be done using a Qr code exchange where the crypto information is embedded in a physical qr code that is then scanned. So you know Alice is the only person scanning it, the only person's getting it. And then they can do all of their further communication over an authenticated Bluetooth channel. This allows Alice Bob to have a shared key rooted in their physical direction. What can we do with this key? We're gonna set up a shared encrypted mailbox. Again, no time to go into the details but the shared encrypted mailbox is authenticated based on the key k. And so only Alice and Bob have access to it.

Or they say maybe this person was it what was supposed to be a peaceful event. So maybe, you know, don't trust them immediately to keep your safety interests. In mind. So then they send this annotation to the mailbox and let's say, Bob meets Charlie at an event. And wants to check and see if they have any mutual contacts, So they contact the mailbox, get the mail and receive the annotation. This works also with events. So let's say Alice sees a protest and the organizer is eve, and maybe Alice knows eve and Alice says, Okay. So Alice gives this an identifier for instance, by hash it, and says this event is being organized by friends, hope to see there. Or maybe Alice doesn't know Eve and says nobody can confirm Eve identity, proceed with caution. And so they send this annotation to the system now Bob, if Bob sees the same event, can go and check and see if any of Bob's organizing contacts have evaluated this event for trustworthiness. So they can see whether Alice knows eve does not know. So this allows Alison Bob to digitally and inc out confidential share trust assessments of any person place or. In conclusion, I wanna highlight a quote from the Hr c draft that says that it is we are impacting people with our designs. So every decision we make in this space holds power and it does impact people's ability to exercise their freedom of assembly and association. And so we we wanna mitigate the danger, but we also wanna clearly communicate to people what's going on. And so how do we go about doing this? Like, this is not a trivial task?

But anyway, maybe you can just talk about the annotation a little bit more in your scheme. So I'm wondering if those annotations are actually passed to other users like Ken bob, annotations, or is it just a hash on the phone? Because I think one thing you've pointed out and thought about quite a lot, obviously, our in person's, which back when, you know, actual civic space was robust and filled with protesters at the moment, it's rather chilled around the world for a variety of reasons. You know, folks work in concerts on that you might have one person who's a little un, but then there could be others too. And if those annotations are public, and I imagine that's like another way to check, oh, like, did I make... You know, Am I listed in any annotations that say I'm on trustworthy? Fellow disrupt her. Right. So... Yeah. Just curious about that. Yeah, Great question. So that they're not public. They go only to who you indicate them going to. And so Alice is not posting that annotation of bob publicly online. They're sending it through the encrypted mailbox. And so only people that Alice chooses to see that annotation can choose it. They could make the annotation public. If they wanted to, but this this system is is kind of like internal network annotation system, that will help people communicate with physically trusted folks. And so the question of physical in infiltrated, we we don't talk and that's why the the framing of this is how do we not increase the risk in digital space. So we...

My question comes from my sort of initial problems in the nineties with Pg that the sort of web trust concept it has sort of natural scaling boundaries where it just comes difficult to manage it individually at some point, and I wonder if you had sort of thought about that. Where you what what do you will this scale to the planet to a country? Two hundred people. But what's your feeling Or do you have any any data have you thought about this? Guess you have. Yeah.

And so we're operating on the humans scale. So we don't need this to scale to the planet. Like, I I mean, Anyone over the planet it could be making their own personal networks. But as humans, we only have a certain amount of other humans we can reasonably connect within physical space. And so I think that this the scale is a bit different.

And, like, an event on social media, and then I would imagine, so we're playing with this a little bit, but the current plan is to have anything you can hash.

There's this object and so it... That counts for that object you're seeing, It accounts for anybody sharing that object.

So like, a sting ray, for example, would would collect all that or really just even monitoring the communications on the network, like nothing traffic. Would reveal the communication, but in this case, because it's an encrypt, like an authenticated channel, that they they've shared a key and via the Qr code, they can generate an an authenticated Bluetooth channel that would allow you to your your devices to communicate in close proximity to people. So you could have a bunch of people if they have shared keys. To communicate on the ground without having a network connection, but that's something I think that we would have to think about further in terms of the trust component and and doing something with that, but I am... I think it's a great question. Interested in developing something like that in the future."

There's a lot of research on these add hoc spontaneous communication for all kinds of scenarios like, Zebra tracking in Africa out down to, like, like, fire came out that some point. So there's a lot of thing here I think there's a lot of all overlap. That would be interesting to explore. Sorry for something. Great. Thank you. I sorry. I didn't press the clicker because my phone's crushed. My name's Kenneth Work at h k u s t. Fantastic talk is really interesting. I was curious One of the challenges with these human based trust networks is that you tend to create kind of central points of failure. Because naturally, some people are more popular and more mobile than other ones. On those central points then could be on targets for oppressive regimes to try to get them. To do things up perhaps we wouldn't want to do. You thought about any mechanisms that could try to protect against that? Yes. So I it... The encryption is such that the leaders via the number of people communicating with one person, like, the the actual identities of the center points are not revealed to the system. So the... That data is not reveal to the server. However, kind of in a human human way. Like, if there are other side channel ways of people figuring out who the leaders are. We don't protect against that's again a human issue. So if somebody's is physically on the ground and there seeing people and seeing who the leader is. Then we can't use crypto in that case, but we are aiming to create a digital system such that these central points and the people who are really organizing are not revealed in in digital space. Was wondering, could you have some sort of a station model where you have people repeatedly verifying the reputation of others. And then for example, might have just me. Just with another person. Just another person, he then kind of comes all the way back to me."

So talking about kind of hops in the trust network, like if I trust you and you trust someone else then is there a measurement for me trusting that third person through you. We are thinking about that. That's that's very complicated. So something I didn't talk about in the talk, but really important is that we need a lot of user studies for this. That's like a huge part of this project. So if you're someone who does user studies easy, like, definitely talk to me, please. Yeah. So so that... That's a really nice thought, and I'm not sure how it would pan out in practice. So we are thinking about that and also with the mutations over the network graph that's kind of in preliminary stages at this time. But Likely there is some trust. It's just not the same amount of trust. So there... It becomes very complicated. Like, your trust relationship with one other person has already kind of complicated. And so then it's like, well, do I trust them enough that anybody they trust? I also trust. And so it's it's a more complicated trust analysis. But, yeah. Cool. A general point, there was a bunch of peer peer mechanism not tried to do this to sort of establish this just between unknown peers. So there are some protocols that could help do this in a scalable way. Interesting. Wish. Yeah. Cool. Thank you great. Thank you so much. So thank you very much. Thank you closed ma'am.

My sense from the list was that the authors explained where they didn't want to incorporates certain changes and explain the reasons why and there's been silence from there. I think my reading was the office asserted that they had chief consensus. And they didn't see a follow up. From the from the people commenting. And I they don't believe that it is sufficient to just assert that the comments been addressed until you see a response from the person making comments to say either they agree that they have been addressed. Or they disagree, or they agreed to disagree. You cannot simply assert that comments have been addressed without following up with the the person making the comment. This is Ten neil not me can't.

I do not think that is sufficient to declare consensus until we have seen a response from the person making the comments to which they were responding Okay.

Group In this case, my understanding however is that the research group has chosen that this is a consensus drift. Therefore it needs the group research groups consensus to proceed. The group could decide to publish this as a non consensus draft which would change the boiler plate that went on the the beginning of the draft. But would then need to document why it's being published as a non sensor draft. And he whose views it his representing.

It's not just about intimate partner violence, but it also could be child abuse or other kinds of things is that it's actually about the harm and not images of the harm. So Cs is about getting images of abuse off of the internet, which is a bit of an abstraction. Right? And so this draft has It's not it's overlapping.

It doesn't matter which app store. And how good they are at sort of policing this kind of app and find in search for spouse, which is a gross term. But you can imagine what it means and find dozens. Of apps. And my our my sense is that they all kind of work with the same core elements of of basically abusing network network effects to stock and all those things, but actually looking at the ways the technologies design might also uncover some interesting stuff for us. So Yeah. That's where we started. Calling perkins. So... Yeah. I mean, this is clearly an important topic and it it's a quick a good draft for this group to be working on I think. So so it would certainly support working on this topic. Following on from the the comments that And and Mallory just made up. I I would be a little cautious about trying to broaden it too much right? Focus drifts that talk about particular topic tends to be easier to complete and tend to be I think higher impact because the they that they can really address that one topic. So having a bunch of focused drafts then after you've done a few of these, perhaps trying the step back and draw some broader conclusions."

Often than generalized too early. Yes. I agree. Also, right now there's this assumption that maybe could be applied to these general cases, but we still need to do the actual research to see if indeed it could be generalized at the moment is contextualize for one. I think it's fair to have it away. We can start orders to looking at all the situation, and then maybe kind of For us after learning about it, actually see which kind of those can be generalized situations. Right. Thanks, Sofia. I think we just have like, two seconds for our other our last our less agenda item, which is on the charter and, you know, actually really failed here it's to... I was I was meant to bring up a really obvious sort of what do you call it change control slides on what we've we've modified and I didn't do that. So in fact, we don't actually have any But to catch everyone up, we can maybe have a quick conversation, and I'll give you an update on where it's at. We made pretty changes other than the obvious one, we're gonna change the p in our acronym from or well, we're proposing to change the P acronym from protocol protocols to policy, so that we can just... I think arguably folks have... Well folks have made the argument that we're not actually going to be changing what we're doing. We're just putting it in the charter a little bit more explicitly that sometimes work on human rights also. Can be relevant to policy discussions as well. Though that"

    "text": "there are changes in then the charter texts that reflect that slight shift. We also took the opportunity to remove certain kinds of work items that were not actually working on anymore and other sort of tidy ups. Right now, the state of it is Colin and I have had a discussion about some remaining questions around the question of guidance specifically. So we do in our current charter have a line about guidelines to the I etf and my sort of proposed charter text made that to ambiguous, and it's and importance thing to get right because in the past the the the research group has needed to tread carefully around that because the I f cannot. Really tell the Ie what to do that I think... So I wanna wanna make sure that the next revision of it hone in on that particular line and gets it better. So I haven't had a chance to sit down you that yet, because Cohen and I just discussed it. Last night. So you're all waiting for me, and I'm afraid I'll have to take it onto the list again. I don't think we can get a home or anything around finalized charter text this morning. We also don't have time for that. But we do have time anyone if you want to get in queue, especially colin if you wanted to jump in since I just name checked you. Oh, and, John, thank you for coming up, because you've also commented on the list. Appreciate that. Yeah. I don't how much to add other than what you thought what you said earlier. You know, as if you said met myself in in yourself and and Maria had a a comment left had had a discussion last night place on some comments maria made on the draft charter. I think it's close that there's clearly some some disagreement that that were in the process are resolving, but I think it's close. I think we agree. I think we just don't have a text that Yeah. And thanks for that. Very much colin. yeah. Because I haven't really. Phrase it just quite right."

And what I mean by that is I think you're doing a great job and handling the drafts on the working group material. Addressed has a very... Very traditionally meant to understanding it men. The authors or the working group have considered the comments may not have been accepted may not have been resolved, but they've been. To the extent that a document has had all the issues considered then they are addressed and it's valid to move ahead with a document and call for consensus from group. It's not required to have a positive lock on each and every comment to make sure the author agrees with the consideration. If we're gonna change the rules, let's all have a discussion of that, but I think you've doing a great job with your interpretation of it. Thank you, John. And for someone making a comment addressing from you that is highly regarded. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi Mark. I'm with the Uk's department for science innovation in Tech. I really like the re charter. I think it's a positive direction. How you say. I'm making it clear the work that the group has already been doing and I think that that helps kind of Yeah, really kinda make the work stronger. On the charter text. Specifically, I really think that kind of recognizing the kind of foundational view that. Technical decisions do have these kind of wider implications and kind of cause these ripple effects is important. And I also thought that kind of drawing out the kind of idea that it's important to understand the kind of pull your wider implications of technical decisions, but also kind of the other way and kind of the kind of technical implications of policy decisions having that kind of two way bridge is really good. Thanks, Merrick. And if you're really jazz about the whole tech is"

You might you might just read it and and see what you think. But else. Hi, Aubrey. Well aubrey former c chair actually founding c chair of this group. Welcome to the Mic. And very slow sometimes. I just wanted to ask him the charter change. I just wanted to ask in the charter change. One of the things that it always interested me and I felt frustrated by was that we couldn't go into how these things were implemented how these things have deployed. Does this open up those as being in scope. And perhaps it does and it says it I haven't quite understood it yet so. Treat me is slow. I'm super intrigued now. I didn't know that that was part of a his Historical conversation and the way the chart was from their first time. I particularly would find not interesting. Right. Now we had... In fact, while I was still playing chair, we we had a couple times where we had people come in with contributions that weren't about the protocol itself but it was how they were being implemented implemented. It was how they were being deployed mh. And we deemed it to be sort of out of scope. I'm wondering if by changing the p from protocol to policy, we've opened that up to being in scope. Right. And I do... I mean, just for folks, if this is to inside baseball, I mean, there is a known gap between the standard and the implementation that the I etf in general does not touch does not work on nobody's the protocol police, etcetera etcetera. But from a from a real world impact perspective, that sort of matters quite a lot. So I don't know if we wanna include that in the try maybe take a look at the new charter text, which I'm gonna be sending to the list imminent and see if there's a place where we can sneak it in and then see if it costs anybody to freak out. Okay. So at the moment,"

    "text": "policy does not include it in your understanding. Okay. That was really my question. Thanks. Well, it it could be... And we could probably do a lot implicitly with that very word policy. I don't know that we want to try to be and get away with it. I think it'd be rather better if it were in the so that nobody could then come the big frustration that made me walk away. Well. We should fix that. I. Lars I got a data tracker locked me out and doesn't let me back in, so I can't get in queue. I was gonna say so unlike for working groups over the Ihs side the the reason motivation for research charter slightly weighted. It's not there to, like, clearly define what's in announced that it's much more sort of description. For outside. To to know whether somebody could be interested to participate or not. Right? So I don't think you needed to, like, worry about every word or every character here. It's it's much more, you know, how this group advertise itself to others that that look like find this and wonder whether is something for demo or not. Right? So, you know, whether it's deployment or implementation, I can't recall that we rule that out. I I don't think there was you were the tutoring I know. It's there's not. I remember, but there there's... I don't think there's a reason to turn on interesting work just because, you know, it's maybe a little bit outside of chart. This is a research group. Right? So This is how we learn stuff. K. Yeah. Aubrey please if you could suggest something I I would be. Welcome. Welcoming to it. I think that's it. We've gone over time. I appreciate your seven minutes that you gave us an additional the two hours. Again, wanna I thank our speakers Thank you all for coming, and we will see you in San Francisco."
