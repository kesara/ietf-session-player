    "text": "Neeraj from cisco these are the co-authors I\u0027m gonna be talking about extended evpn mobility procedures for EVP and IRB use cases as the title suggests the main objective of the draft is to define mobility procedures for Mac and IP for all evpn IRB use cases and the work here is based on top of Mac mobility procedures defined in 7432 so essentially we classify all the mobility use cases for EVP and IRB into three main categories scenario a where the Mac IP bindings are always fixed across a VM move scenario B where a host IP could move to a different IP binding and scenario C where a host Mac could move to a different IP binding so for the scenario a it\u0027s pretty much the existing Mac mobility procedures can be leveraged and applied to scenario a it\u0027s the scenario B and C with changing Mac IP bindings that are complicated by the fact that in evpn i rvv advertised both Mac and IP beach ability by a single Mac IP route type two with a single sequence number attribute attached to that route that signals the route version for both Mac and IP components of that of that route so essentially if I have an IP that moves to a different Mac binding now how do I assign sequence number to the new Mac I feed out if I treat it like a fresh route and assign a new sequence number then the mobility for the IP component would not take effect because it\u0027s already advertised with a higher sequence number similarly if the Mac moves to a different IP binding if I treat it like a fresh route assign it a new sequence number the mobility for the Mac component of the route would not take effect because the Mac is already advertised with a higher sequence number so okay okay just few minutes two minutes okay sure so basically the solution that is defined the key part of the solution is that we associate the sequence number attribute only with the local Mac component of the route so only with the local Mac route and the Mac IP essentially inherits the sequence number from the parent Mac and we define two key rules that must be followed when assigning sequence number to the Mac the rule 1 is essentially same as the existing Mac mobility rule and the rule 2 is essentially that when I learn a local Mac IP route the sequence number assigned to the Mac component must also be higher than any older Mac Association for that IP so essentially with these rules in place I\u0027ll skip the the baseline scenario but essentially when the IP moves to a new Mac binding rule 2 comes into play and the new Mac binding gets assigned a sequence number that is "
