For It f one sixteen. I I I am here in person, Rick Taylor, our c chair has joined us remotely But let's continue. For those who... For whom this is your first It f meeting, Please note well, some of the things that are pointed out here. Let me call out one or two in particular. You agree to follow our It processes and policies while you are here. Anything that you may talk about that is covered by patents or patent applications must be disclosed.

We're gonna spend just a few more minutes going over some of the admin topics and we're gonna dive right into our presentation We have several of them, we're going to try and get through all of them and we will be moderating our time to make sure that we stay on time and we do have roughly ten minutes of of open mic time at the end. Before we begin, are there any concerns or request relating to the schedule at this time. Nope. Okay. Moving on. Lastly, we do need minute taken, and there is a shared notepad. Please join with Adam to make sure that we have the best notes that we can. And Adam, would you serve as the jab? Thank you very much. Alright. With that, Rick, is there anything else you'd like to add? Nope. All good for my end. Thank you very much. So the the very the very first agenda topic is just some awareness around two different working group documents that we are finalizing now. And I just wanna make sure that the working group has some we have some attention brought to it. The first one that has just been adopted are the C security context for Bp sack. For those of you that are aware Bp sack is the bundle protocol security, set of standards, Rc c ninety one seventy two, and that requires the use of security contacts for for exchanging and interpreting the crypto material that's carried by Bp sack."

The second doc method that we were looking at now are an update to administrative record types or created administrative record types registry for Bp v seven. This is a a somewhat small document that clarifies that Bp seven agent is intended to use a particular sub registry for its administrative record types and that it makes a code point reservation for private or experimental use. A request has been made for working group last call on this. For those that have either read it and do not believe we to a working group last call on this, or those that have a concern about doing a working group last call on this Are there are there any concerns about taking this to working group last call at this time? If so, please let us know now. And my mark is going to join the queue. Mark, I'm sorry. I didn't started the meeting I was not able to.

I know that Brian Is person asking for a call on this, and he is unable to make it to this meeting, what I would ask is that could you take that and post it to the mailing list just to make sure that he would have a chance to respond. Yeah. It's fine. I'm just saying That should be our last one. Fair, it has been claimed that this document is holding up something in another working group we've been asked to prioritize. Rick, Very quickly. Replying to Mark, yes, I completely agree. The reality is this is the last of the documents to catch up with the emissions that were made in previous documents to to get the right. It's something personally, I'm very keen or making sure we get those in the documents. But I only do require a document to cover it, which is why we have to have this, but I couldn't agree. All alright. Thank you very much. So please, Again, if you have opinions on those two documents, make sure that they are represented in the mailing list. Otherwise, let's get on to our first major topic for the day, which is the Ip Url sc update Rick take it away. Thank you very much.

This is why we are bringing this document. This is why we are proposing this change text. Now the the working group is familiar with it, and it is a working group document. We have removed a lot of that rush mail text and replace it with what we call specification text. So the document now reads as a spec. Which is what woman would expect in a standard. So that is the... If you do a diff between this version and the previous version, you'll see a lot of the text has changed. But the vast majority of that is about the tone of the document the other major thing we have done is to split the documented to two clear parts, not sections isn't quite the right word because there's, like, eight sections. But The first part of the document deals with the Ip Uri scheme. So as this should be familiar to people. Dp addresses things in terms of You eyes? And we are specifically in this document talking about an update to the Ip. Scheme. So the first half of this document almost is just focused on that Uri scheme. Meaning the second half talks about how one encodes these updated Scheme url eyes. For Bp seven to be used as end endpoint identifies. And having done that work I I don't know about ed, but I personally feel it really clarifies the document two parts. So you can understand what would talking about with Ip uri eyes, and then some of the issues we're addressing in terms of encoding that.

Authority number dot note number dot service number. Where the authority number is a numerical identifier of thirty two bits length of the authority that allocated the subsequent note number The subsequent note number is a common number thirty two bits a length allocated to Ip Uri resources, c located on the same node. Now these are logical constructs. Remember you uri eyes talk about resource identifier? It's all about resources. And this is the first time we'll introduce the work node, and I'll come back to it throughout the the rest of the presentation. And it's it's been the hardest part of getting this document right is is dancing around this word node. And in this case, when we're talking about your ice schemes, we're talking about a logical construct. Nothing physical and we're really trying to dodge any bundle post called d connotation. We're just saying, everything every resource that is named with Ip that is c located on some logical construct called the node shares a note number. The third part as before service number. So this some way of discriminating between well known or private use types of service. And it's important to consider those as types because different nodes can all have a dot two service. It is of type whatever dot two is. I don't believe it's actually registered it or in use anywhere, but if someone's using a dot two or a dot."

So everyone is gonna say, oh, but you've added these authority numbers. What was wrong with what we were doing before? Well, Nothing. Really? The purpose of the numbering authorities is to give a to allow a better allocation of those note numbers. But the existing I on a registry this has existed up until this point and will continue to be used is given the name the default numbering that authority and is given the value zero. And when composing Ip you eyes, that use the default numbering authority, I e zero as the first component zero is omitted. So if you have an Ip, which is in effect, no x dot y, it is written synthetic in the text format as x y. So all existing implementations that expect extra y can continue to work on Extra y. And the numbering authority is automatically assumed as zero. And therefore, the default number authority is allocated that number. When we say the default numbering authority, we mean there is the number has been the x, the note number has been taken from the existing Ion registry. So we are forward porting the existing Ion registry that's that was used for Cb, bundle protocol versions. Six encoding and so it's inherited through and brought forwards an updated and renamed to make sure it is absolutely explicit that this is the set of allocations that have been handed out under the au of Ion for"

So node number zero is the null endpoint. If you're unsure what that is go and check the references in this document, which point our ninety one seventy one, B three seven. The null end point is basically nowhere. So Node number zero is nowhere. Has uses within bundle Particle version seven. Node number one, we have introduced in this document to mean local node. You could think of equivalent of local host, but we decided to avoid overloading that word. So a one dot address means it's on the same node, So service two if we want to talk to service one and didn't need to look up its own address all the time. Could say, from one dot two. Two one dot one. And it would just get routed by the the bundle processing within the note itself. Would never leave the box. That means fundamentally the note number one local node identifier are non So there is a strict rules in the document to say, if you have a one dot address, you must not let it leave your box because it's it is a relative local address only. Other clarification which came out of the previous conversations and on the meeting list was the range two to two to the fourteen. Are declared as private use. So that means anyone can use them.

Be beyond two to the fourteen. All of the extra allocation comes out to the exist registry. So if you have an allocation in the Cb g registry, that will continue. You won't lose your registry. And... Yep. That somebody pointed out in the latest review comments when I the snapshot out to the eye on a registry, took it about three, four months ago, and I think some more registrations have been made so it needs to be aligned.

What is new in this revision to the document. Is we have a allowed numbering of we've allowed organizations to ask for a range of authority numbers. So I was originally quite keen on having numbering of authorities and sub numbering authorities and having some sort of complex almost endless series of dots that you could have because Mathematics it was interesting. A lot of people turned around at that point to went at utter madness when it comes to processing and pausing and having limitless strings, it's not a great idea. So we went background to the other end of the spectrum and said, okay. They were are there was only one number which identifies your number of your authority. But it was felt that it had... That we had lost some ability to to have range allocated to the super organization wherein they could sub divide those locations within their own hierarchy And so an external observer could say, oh, anything in that range, any note number allocated by an numbering authority in this range, I can treat according to some similarity rule. So using a bundle protocol example, ccs. Could ask for a range and could then hand out one of the numbering authority numbers of that range to each of the member states that takes part in Ccs or member sub organizations. So an external observer who would receive a a a Dp seven bundle good look at the source or the destination. Any of the E ids and say, oh, I see. That has come from the Ccs Ds super organization."

But to use your Ccs, Sds example. They get allocated range in an in the registry, it says this range is allocated to Cs Would there be a mechanism that c could go back and say, hey, we took this one number and gave it to a sub authority and we'd like to put it here to say that's where it went. Is that a mechanism we want to use or have? Or do we wanna ignore that? So I think you've asked two questions there. If I understand it. I think you've asked can I retrospectively extend my range can I retrospectively hand off the allocation I have to somebody else? Is that what you'll saying kind of, but it's more just a metadata saying that Ccs goes back and says I wanna just mark somewhere publicly that this is the sub... Okay. I understand.

With the initial values does not contain like a range column. I think they're gonna be allocated in ranges, It should have a range and he might also include, like range in a a slider format. That works. And then last week Sorry. Quick point on that we were quite wary about doing that slash notation. Because I think it had such echoes of... This is an ip address. And and we're not talking about it's not if it was part of the number, I could see that argument being valid, but we're really say these are such high high that introducing.

But if you say, I am type two, then there is a specific encoding for Ip uri eyes. What we are doing is maintaining the existing coding and adding a second encoding. So the first encoding is the two elements scheme. That is exactly the same as written in bundle protocol in ninety one seventy one. But what we have done is we have re expressed it to map the semantics back to our our initial formulation of an Ip Uri. So in terms of authority number, note number and service number. So really, it's a bit of words with. The identical on the wire representation. Really makes no difference. But it's just to make sure we've consistency, it mapped through correctly. Elements scheme stored a see array of two elements. I'll come into that a bit more. Three elements scheme, you saw a sea array of three elements. The reason for this is that if you have a numb zero authority number you will get a better. A more concise coding. If you have a zero authority number, you don't need the three elements scheme you can continue to use the two elements scheme. It is more concise. Okay. And because the length of the array when encoded in Sea is the first architect paused as you walk down the stream. The encoding team schemes are be blatantly different when you are writing your parser. And if you are a preexisting pause, you will spot a three elements scheme and say, I don't understand this and react appropriately.

Because in Ninety one seventy one the note number and the service number are both considered sixty four bit unsigned integers. If you remember back to the start of this reading the latest version of the draft, we have said an authority numbers that two bit and a note number is thirty two bit so that we can do a bit shift. Can the two together. Put the authority number in the height thirty two bits. The number on the low thirty two bits. And this is compatible with the existing allocations from the Cb registry. We haven't allocated more than thirty two bit numbers. And this also allows you to encode your authority numbers. Not quite as bit efficiently as the as the three element coding. But it works. They're dis distinguish. They are unique and existing implementations. Having talked to various people with existing implementations. We'll handle this without a code change. Which is quite important for things which are just about to deploy. Okay. Second element remains the service number. If you're using the default number authority, it's zero You don't need three elements encoding, you can continue use the two element encoding you get a nice short concise category.

Should we have first come first served sort of two to the sixteen due to the thirty two, remembering that there is a step function with see encoding. Beyond two to the sixteen euro of four byte encoding, there's no three and a half byte or anything like that. There's a debate there or should somebody said it should just be excellent review for the whole thing.

You know, example dot com equivalent. Service number allocation policy. We have currently specified that specification is required for anything lower than thousand and ninety six. This was literally me looking at port allocations with Tcp and Udp and saying, we've survived quite long with that, let's keep going. But of course, we've got do to the sixty four address space perhaps, we could be greedy here and say Do you know what the good numbers down at the bottom end?

Could we do something where the one boat coatings are fifty percent sent specification of fifty percent free for all two bytes like likewise.

The contrary, Ip four Ip six As numbers, are actually only allocated to R therefore, then they do downstream medications. Right?

Next slide, please. So to start in on that overview. The D is a management approach for a challenge networking environments. And I've laid out some of the key features that get us to that point. So starting with open loop controls, since we are in a challenge networking environment, we can't rely on timely round trip communication. And we can't support a request response architecture. Instead we're using open loop control. Second, we're using autonomy to acknowledge the fact that the managed and managing device are often not able to communicate. So we need that managed device itself. To be able to self manage In this case, apply policy and use an autonomy engine to provide deter behavior across devices. And third, we need a compress model. We need compact and encoding so that we can implement the D not only on resource constrained devices. But also create the small message sizes that we need when we're operating over intermittent or low rate lengths. Next slide, please. So digging further into those decisions made to"

So in the brief moments of connectivity that we do have between the managed and managing device. We take advantage of that to pre share data definitions. So data and models are shared so that the manager an agent, also the managed and managing device. Are able to agree on what information needs to be modeled, what actions can be taken when certain state information is observed. And then second getting back into the idea of autonomy the agents themselves need to be able to manage themselves since a manager can't be expected to always be in the loop. We use a local autonomy engine to do that. So policy statements are provided by a manager that give the cues for it the agent to then take and apply different actions one different state information is observed. And then finally, we're taking the route of command based management. So because we're are in this challenged environment, we aren't using bulk updates and large data stores. Instead we provide the managing device with a command and control interface. Which allows the exchange of information like policy to configure that autonomy engine. Slide, please. So getting into that actual autonomy model you can see at the top of this figure the flow of information of the D manager, providing policy statements"

That policy is being translated into roles that identify state information of interest and the action or actions that the agent should take if that state information is observed. And the agent can take several different actions, it might be updating that local rule database. It's run runtime data storm. It might be instructing a managed application to execute a control, which would influence its behavior. Or it might generate a report to inform the manager of the event that's occurred. Next slide. So I'm going to try to be careful with time, but run through some of the desirable design properties that we've incorporated in the d just in acknowledgment of this challenged environment and the fact that this management approach needs to be able to handle these challenges as they scale within the network. So next slide. So first property is dynamic architectures. We acknowledge that there is going to be a dynamic network top So we need a dynamic architecture to take advantage of that rather than be hindered by it. And I put on the slide here for emphasis that The D is designed to run in every environment the bundle protocol can be used but there isn't an underlying transport protocol requirement. So we're avoiding limiting assumptions like a static network or prescribing a specific protocol stack for this solution. Like. Second is hierarchical modeling"

We want to be able to hierarchical relate them so that we are avoiding repetition and then being able to reuse those data models as is appropriate. And these models are also cohesive, so they are to manage ace single application or protocol. And that gives us the compress that we need concise. Encoding as well as pattern matching and in support of autonomy. Next slide. We also need to support push mechanisms rather than pull mechanisms for the x exchange of information, and we use local autonomy to determine what information and when it should be pushed from an agent to a manager. Next slide. As I touched on earlier, we need efficient data and coatings part of that is provided by the data model design. And that allows us to minimize message size. Next slide. We also need universal absolute data identification so that we can manipulate individual data elements. So I've added an extract from the Ep v seven P as an example of the way that we're structuring this information so that the agent and manager can perform that information exchange. Agree on data definitions and then follow the same absolute data identification so that the agreed upon information is being monitored or manipulated."

We can't handle in challenged networking environment or might cause undefined behavior. So the examples that I've put up here are associate or synchronizing on state information. Both familiar approaches but approaches that aren't effective in a challenged networking environment. Particularly because of the delays and disruptions that we might encounter. Next slide. We also support runtime data definitions, so this is creating essentially a new piece of data from at existing data, so that's support for items like data fusion and sampling. Next slide. And then finally, we've touched on autonomy a couple times that just to drive that point home. The standalone operation and management of the agent is important due to those times of disconnection, between the manager and the agent. And this provides the deter predictable behavior of that agent. Even when those devices are disconnected that we need. Next slide. And I believe that this is my final one. So just an acknowledgment of the updates that we've made to the use cases just as a way of showing how the D can be applied to different challenge network scenarios giving a more concrete idea of how this might be used. So with that, if there are questions. You. Oh, go ahead. I believe We have Sally in the queue."

And you have no certainty about their availability. So that might this but I like very much what I see is that you you have shared models that all the entities are talking about the same things. But approaching those models to be changing state through through conference controls. You you might end up with extremely difficult scaling problem. So that and especially the validate data about control instruction have been implemented correctly. So what might be interesting to a little bit low at is that can you more come get watch. Not trying to give a action where to go. But set the end state reference and instead for for the ended day. So Just the comment about that we might discuss later about. Definitely, It would be great to take this to the mailing list as well, and we can discuss... I can make it much clearer to data model and the way that we're supporting controls and limiting I'll say limiting the the actions that we're taking in response to state information. I would just jump in. I know we have two more people in you if if we could make the points very quickly, and then we can take further discussion to the mailing list, but stuart, your next Thanks, Sarah. Question about your statement that the autonomy must be deter. Do you mean fully deter or do you mean bounded as in, like, the As standard thirty two sixty nine standard practice for message to safely bond behavior aircraft systems containing complex functions using runtime insurance. And and we have all memorized that story. Yeah. Yeah of course. So the the point that I"

    "text": "meant to emphasize in saying deter behavior as well as predictable behavior is that the goal of this autonomy engine. Is to ensure that when the manager and agent are not able to be communicating. We can still know what state to expect from the applications that are being managed by that agent by specified of buying and being careful about the actions that can be taken as a result of the change in state information. We know where the applications are ending up. We know the state. That's understood. So I guess it's a question as far as the resolution of knowing the state. You need to know the state down to the individual bit you need to know that the state lies within some bounded space. So so I will say that that is a good mailing discussion. And and one more mark thank. Bless maybe it's not appropriate for your presentation, but you mentioned yang models do you Are you having game models? Or good. Yeah. So I... That's something that I... You know, I just passed right over because in the interest of time. But the the point that I wanted to make on that slide is that, you know, we're emphasizing that this combination of new features is what's motivating in this management approach. But we don't have to and we are intentionally avoiding reinventing anything that's already providing those features. So, yes, we have the idiom to provide that data model, but Yang is a viable data modeling language to be using in this and and also just to jump in the the architecture document"

And we'll be going over the asynchronous resource updates. identifier Sorry. Can't get rid of me. So I am presenting on behalf of Brian S. So going over the updates that he's made to the draft. So to introduce this, be Ari is a part of the D management texture ecosystem. And it's the mechanism that we use to identify and invoke objects within the b application data model. And the air eye draft has been out for a couple years that's resulted in several implementations. And in implementing that draft, there's been identification of capabilities as well as inefficiencies in that syntax that Ryan's updates are focused on fixing. So to the second to last point on this slide. These are changes that are in work and definitely looking for feedback in terms of what's been changed here and the lengthy list of to dos at the end for next steps. And then just a point that the changes that have been made to this document impact the Ari and coatings. But they're not changing the concepts behind the asynchronous management model objects, or the eight am itself. Next slide."

So in other words, we're trying to make this ari syntax. As simple as we can, simple usable, easy to encode. But at the same time, the Ari ai is a powerful tool within this because system. So we can't over simplify to get rid of important capabilities like premium or object testing. That we need for management within a challenged environment. Next slide. So there are a few issues that are addressed by the updates to this document. First being that the binary encoding of an air ai work close but not quite sea. So that led to some complexities that cause people to have to implement custom handling for special cases and different corner cases that we are looking to eliminate There were red in both the binary and text and coatings of the Ari. So for example, the object type was present twice in some of the object reference. The texting coding also had some amp specifically, the Path components were not well specified. And then there were are also some ari types that could either be eliminated because they're not being sent over the wire. And we don't need the ability to encode them. Or they could be replaced by another object type without the loss of any capability, there's an example in here. Next slide. So moving towards simplification."

    "text": "The changes that were made to the air ai structure itself. Was first the explicit categorization of Ara So an Ari is either a literal or object friends. There's no overlap in those stats. Second, an Ari in its binary encoding is now a sea item. So we're able to use Cd to define that sc. And we can also use c validation tools to book validate and generate that sea bar. The text encoding is a context free grammar. It's no longer dependent on the Ad atm itself. But is modeled after the Atm structure. So the example in the middle here shows that an Ari is composed of the name of the am that defines it, and then the object type and name as well. And then there are several points on here for the restriction and simplification of naming. So the names based items have been reduced were restricting names further to use the segment and z ab b and f pattern. And we've also removed the scheme prefix from nested Eyes. Next slide. So There are some really bunched up examples on this slide. I apologize for that formatting. But the the emphasis here is that this update allows us to represent new and encoded forms, so you'd see that in the byte string that's shown there. And then the the example at the bottom is to just show now using this context free grammar We don't need to consult the to determine the parameter type. Next slide."

    "text": "So there was also a goal to simplify typing overall. So this started with the separation of literal types from object reference types, which we discussed. But then moved further to separate be amp specific literal types from the encoded types which brings us closer to mirroring Sea. And then there were some object types that could be removed because they're never present in an ari, they may be referenced by an Ari, but they're not present with the actual Ari, so they don't need to be encoded and these sent over the wire. Next slide. And this is to drive that point home showing the the object types and the permanent primitive types and the updates to those points. And the removal of compound types, which are the objects that we don't have to support and send the wire. Next slide. On here you'll see that the binary Ari in coding is now real sea warm. So again, this allows us to use already existing tools for validation, which makes that implementation much easier year. And it also gives us smaller coatings in several cases. When we compare to the original draft. And I believe that there's an example of that on the next slide. So un typed literal and object references are now always giving us shorter encoding with this update tight literal can result in a longer encoding there is an example. Which is again"

So in summary, the changes that have been made here are the separation of the literal and object type We've simplified the text encoding using that context free moving away from that dependency on the. The binary encoding is now pure sea and we have a Cd l scheme mount we can use with that. And the restrictions that we've added on naming have the texting encoding easier to use. As well. Next slide. So the last three slides are laying out related issues as well as next steps in the direction that we want to take this work in. So I would encourage people who are interested in this to take a closer look and allow some of the open issues that you'd like to discuss and bring that to the mailing list. Just trying to be conscious of time here. So with that, I'll wrap up and take any questions that you have as well as encourage you to speak with ryan on this. Right. Excellent.

And bodies. Obviously, this is a space know, kind of examples, but applies to. Assumption is that there an Ip network on planetary bodies, and that's the current plan of part the space agency's architecture document. So instead of inventing a new email product called native to Vp, then just reuse Internet email. But encapsulate in two bp.

I suppose my my I've got two comments that My first comment think applies to both this in the Sm. Which is I think there's more power to be achieved here rather than just taking the the Http protocol units or the Sm protocol units and sticking them in a bundle because the delay doesn't matter because of the way those protocols are built. And d structuring the logical parts that make up those protocols I'm using the the multi blocked metadata block capabilities that we have in bundle protocol in order to store those logical components. So you could imagine having for an Http request you could have a bundle which has a standard primary block would have an extension block which would be the H headers and the payload you could then include directly into the payload block. Following on from that. Chunking encoding in Http p one point one."

Yeah. But I suppose it goes back to don't just take the blob that would be sent over h and put it in a bundle. It's just like your t shirt says. I I agree. Bp does not equal Ip. You can't just take an Ip packet and store and forward it. It doesn't work. I think the same logic applies here of take a, you know, get wireshark out, grab an Http request. And stuff it in a bundle. I'm not sure is the smart thing to do. I just I think there's more we can do here than just encapsulate and shove it down up b. So so that is just to jump in that that certainly sounds like a much long discuss maybe point. Yes. Can we go on to the next steward? For rick care comment? Let's I disagree. start on the mailing list. Yes. I still here. So Mark, first off, thank you. I'm I'm thrilled that you're doing both of these things. Even if they are going to have in some cases, unpleasant consequences that we're gonna have to deal with. I guess I'd just like to call the attention of the youngsters in the room to the fact that back in the day, we used to have dial on demand routers. Right? And Mh. Branch offices that had a land and didn't have internet connectivity would Once a day, dial into the corporate headquarters and make u uc connection... Yeah... Yeah. I was waiting you see?

And so to to to Rick's point, I agree that we need to think about granularity and layers of abstraction, you know, we may wanna move something that is more abstract than a conceptually a higher layer than an individual h request in some cases. And so that finally takes me back to your first consideration, which is don't do this with Fancy web pages. Actually, you can do this with fancy web pages, but you don't let the the endpoint parse the h Html l and then make a boat load request. What you do instead is you put a proxy on each end, that proxy parse the Html gets all those pieces satisfied builds a big honking bundle and sends that and I did it in nineteen ninety three and worked just fine. So you can do it. Whether it is smart to do it is an entirely different question. Good points stuart in some ways, what you're describing can be done with what I'm describing. Right? It's just, you know, kinda pre caching kind of optimization and you know, put everything and in multiple bundles. So it it it's doable the way you describe it's just a kind of a Sure. I could probably add a paragraph for two about those kinds of use cases. Okay. Stephen? High Pearl. So at this I think this one is less crazy than the previous one. However, I think in your picture, you had a http be client. I mean, that has to be a modified Http decline or time out probably right. And secondly I think the the the challenge with this one is that, yeah, we don't really use http anymore. We use Https. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think unless you've got a good"

For developing you know, application that may go on long delay networks. Is the only caveat that you know, be careful because the response may take more time than usual.

I'm not sure I necessarily see the benefit of trying to standardize this specific concept because again, it kinda comes back to the what benefit do you get over just simply doing a giant ip wrapper and instead of going all the way down to the Http. But It sounds like we've really made a set list of application protocol convergence layers, more or less is what we really are trying to poke at. But I feel like we as Rick kinda mentioned, there are more things that we can take advantage of than just simply taking the protocol and slapping it into a bundle and running with it. That there's a bunch of other things that really need to be done and probably standardize to really make the usability of these different application protocols Correct. Okay. Just to jump in, I I we will interpret that as a plus one to open that discussion on the mailing list. Yeah. Provide text. Ahead? Ahead first without any had on.

When you're talking about application on all these things, I mean, we have this bundle security and all these things, but also, like, upon application perspective, we need to think about this.

So just a little background. Right? We all know what the E are there's there's two today, the d, the it pms. The idea here is that there's no standardized way to actually address them as a pattern referenced them via a pattern. There are definitely implementations out there, but because there's no standard that means there's not necessarily census against that patterning approach. There's definitely ways we can kind of prem this together, but that prioritization allows us to effectively move force and have a have have a consensus to to make this work So I'm gonna talk a little bit about both N and Ip here. Just a quick note on this slide, the Ip portion is in reference to the Ip update draft y'all heard. Earlier. So moved do the next slide. So here are four use cases and there's probably more that sort of motivate why this pattern should be or could be useful. Number one, security identities, you know, if we don't have a way to reference a group of E ids especially when you're looking at things like signing a certificate, something like that. And if it's not of standardized across the community then that means there could be faults that's that's very bad with regards to secure pretty signing of components. Another piece here is just like insider notation routing blocks. So how do you reference a group of nodes in a network or an entire administrative domain in the network. Definitely need to pattern E ids for that."

So if you need this specified, maybe who can operate on this note or who has authority to do something like in vpc ec, maybe sign or validate some component. You need be able to figure those and and then lastly, just in general in talking in language if someone refers to one of these E. It be nice to make sure we all agree to what what were each saying? So next lot. So this is the link to the to the latest Rc draft that is out of there It describes... Like I said, both two parts, D scheme and the Scheme. So for the d scheme, The first thing to acknowledge is the they need to separate those E ids into both a node name. In a service path segment. And then we can pattern based on either a literal match of those. A match of one part via while card, a match of any parts So I the the node name or the service path. Via wild court or even Reg expressions or encoded means to look for patterns within each of those segments. For the Ip part, we're separating it into you heard earlier the three types the authority numbers a node number and the service number and then separating those into integer or single integer parts. So similar to D n, now you can match on the exact value. Match on a single wildcard card multi card or a range of discrete values using those integers. One of the nice things here, this adds way to compressed sea encoding for those integers as as well as allows is kind of some more complex pattern matching. So move to the next slide and we'll get some examples here. So here on the left, you'll see examples for D on the right you'll see examples for Ip."

    "startTime": "01:42:01",
    "text": "The very first one, it looks fairly boring, but it's worth calling out that this pattern matching scheme actually allows you to match a singleton So here, even though this looks exactly like a D or Ip scheme address, this could equally be a pattern. So it's it's able to go either way. For some of these others, right, for the for the second one, pattern a all nodes on a service you see how we've broken apart that first part the D node name, but then the double asterisk or the wild card for anything beyond that allows you to reference any of services or any of that service path that's beyond that first portion. Same thing for the Ip scheme. A single wild card allows you to reference any service at the end. Third one here, you see how there's two asterisk at the start. So effectively, we were saying here is the service path but anything that falls before that can be a pattern. Similar for Ip, anything of a false before that service of dot five, whether is a an authority part or an authority plus node park. Fall before. Some of the complex well while cards, you can see there's actually now a combination. So maybe you know that there's a prefix in the middle of that d name. But you are unsure of the note name you're unsure of the service, but you're looking for that component. Same thing applied to two different portions of Ip. The last two examples are are definitely a little bit more complex. But shows you the ability to both pattern on a particular expression or range in in the Ip inn right, you can create a sort of set of integer numbers, range of energy numbers. And allows you to filter on that address. The same thing for the mix patterns. Right? It's now like combo of both wild cords and range or reg and wild cards. So just sort of a set of examples here."

And and there's a lot of good precedent for this. In Dns names. And in fact, the our R draft that's written goes into more detail about some of the security implications. For this, but a pattern is not an E. You would need something to reference and and recognize that this is a pattern and use it to look up which E might fall into that. It would never be used as an addressing scheme. E pattern is a super set of E ids. So back to the point that the the single singleton matching pattern is itself. So this is nice and compliant. In that regard. Let's see. So so I think the the to the the last few things at the bottom right. Just trying to call out what is the the scope of some of these patterns specific to Ip. So Ip three dot start star is actually the same as three dot star star. Being that it includes a... Excuse me, node number three. Going again... Going against this new draft of the Ip and scheme this third example here, note that there is no star star at the beginning, therefore, they're is no authority. So kinda go back to the conversation earlier of a, you know, three, I guess, digit a three three component piece of the Ip scheme with this one does not call that out. So it allows you to reference different either the the the authority type of the node type. Numbers here."

Brian is easily accessible over the mailing list. I would say what is the thought? Is there is there a need for this type of patterning should we standardize it in this form or in some other form?
