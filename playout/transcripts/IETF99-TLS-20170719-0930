    "text": "with this problem and the problem was basically how do we get enterprises who control an endpoint to be able to access traffic on this endpoint and the interesting thing about this problem is this is not technically a problem if you control an endpoint in the tls system you control access to secrets the engineering problem now is how do you get access to those secrets and how do you perform decryption and how do you do it in a way that doesn\u0027t actually harm the TLS protocol or prevent adoption and so the idea was to try to find a solution that did not require significant changes did not require the inclusion of kind of unpleasant things it\u0027s a protocol and would actually allow enterprises to do real-time decryption of traffic inside of their own data centers okay so it so there are a handful of possible solutions to this problem many of which already exist the first solution is basically to have end points meaning servers deliver session keys or deliver master secrets that they\u0027ve derived through some kind of out-of-band channel on this is actually pretty workable in fact browsers can already do this servers can certainly do it without too many changes the problem is the number of keys here can be very large so in order to do this and remember the the requirement is real-time decryption by some kind of middle box you have to handle two problems first you have to deliver keys in a very timely manner because these devices that are actually doing monitoring can\u0027t cash very much traffic so if you get D synchronized if you can\u0027t get keys to the right place in the right time you can lose large amounts of traffic so this may not work at scale the second solution is to do something that actually encodes secrets or session keys in banned in the TLS protocol there are a handful of different versions of that one which I actually like a lot and might be a workable solution is to use a full extension where the client says I want to participate in this protocol and the server agrees and then you do an invent inclusion and that may be fine unfortunately some clients which are already present in the data center are legacy systems and they don\u0027t include the logic to do that so it may not work in every case but I do like it as an alternative approach what I don\u0027t like about this solution is that there are a lot of different variants of this idea some of which are very hard to detect I included a kind of a joking suggestion which was by homage chakram let\u0027s use dual EC drbg which is you know hilarious right this is a perfect way to do this we hack our random number generator so that our secrets are generated using something that\u0027s predictable we include something into the protocol where everybody can monitor this and we can laugh about this but the truth is this is a perfectly workable solution or some variant of this is a workable solution it\u0027s very easy for somebody to do without actually harming the TLS protocol and if this group says that that\u0027s the way things should go I really suspect that that somebody is going to implement something like this I don\u0027t like that because it\u0027s completely undetectable if you do it this way and it\u0027s kind of ugly and unpleasant a third approach which actually is detectable is "
