Hopefully, you may have seen this before, but if or an IITF new comer. This is basically kind of a reminder if you're participating, you have to follow the rules and sees of the IETF. And there's a whole lot of them. There are a lot of them are listed there on the BCP. kind of explains the standardization process, you know, how the working group things. There's some other things about any harassment and code of conduct. coprate patents and disclosures. And that's one thing, I guess, I can kinda raise here is that if you if you're gonna participate, IETalk, be here, do anything, and you know about IPR that likes this, need to disclose it. some other minor housekeeping bits. This is kind of how you run the meeting and meet echo. There's one there's an in person against to make sure you log in to the session, scan the QR code, again, it makes sure that we get the rights at appropriately sized room if we're gonna meet again. You're also gonna use this to join the line, the the mic line. the queue so it's that we can better work with remote participants, and I know that we have I I number actually. And you're local, you don't need to turn your audio on. or your video on, please. For remote participants, you should make sure you your audio and video turned off unless you're actually talking or presenting. and we really like you to use a headset. It cuts down a lot of the reverb There's some buttons to press if you're in the if you're in the the IETF agenda you can find the buttons click them, click them, click them, isn't isn't isn't is isn't isn't isn't trade, trade,"

And then Our basic agenda is the chair is doing a little bit of talking, and then we're gonna have Erica also can do a problem statement. We're gonna have we're gonna have a bunch of people talk about how the deploy systems work. and use cases from a number of different vendors, and then we're gonna have a quick talk about the threat model. scope of the charter proposal. And then most of the discussion we wanna spend talking about charter discussion, and then at the end, Alyssa will close-up with the the the actual bot questions, and we'll be running using the show of hand tool.

We're we're very aware that the current solutions out there for detecting unwanted tracking. are stove pipe at best, provide some solutions to some people running some devices, but there's no universal solution. that is cross platform, cross accessory that allows for true interoperability. to help protect as many people as possible.

But this actually starts a little bit sooner. at the beginning of of sorry. Pairing an accessory for the first time, there's an opportunity to deter someone against misuse to this product, educate them that maybe this is illegal activity in some places. and and maybe even collect the pairing registry to help with attribution at a later time. then getting into the next phase, which we'll talk a lot more about. background scanning to show proactive alerts if something unknown to you is traveling with you. doing that in a cross platform, cross accessory interoperable way is will be fantastic. Showing on that alert, meaningful information like, the image of what's tracking you, you may not know familiar with the product, the make and model of it, maybe also instructions or video on how to disable it if you need to disable it. Another aspect to this is just physically finding it. before you can disable it, you need to physically find it."

So now we're gonna talk a little about the system architecture for existing systems both from the location and crowd sourcing aspect and also for unwanted tracking detection systems. This has been abstracted a little bit and generalized So because there's multiple systems out there, but, hopefully, it's educational and helpful enough so you understand how these systems work. Next slide, please. So we're gonna start slow and build in. Some of these concept might might be new to some of you. So the first concept I wanna educate you on is what called near owner mode. There's 2 modes, primarily that tags operate in. ear near owner mode is the mode that's in after you've completed Bluetooth pairing. between an owner phone and the owner's tag. It's near owner here in the sense that it's physically close to the that the phone and the tag are physically close together. Physically close here is defined as within Bluetooth operating range. reason this mode is relevant will become make more sense in the next slide when we contrast it with separated mode Next slide, please. So in separated mode, the tag is physically far away from the owner's phone or owner's devices. Of course, the and physical far here is defined as within outside of Bluetooth operating range."

    "startTime": "00:16:00",
    "text": "Of course, this also, the tag could be in this mode if the phone is powered off or it's battery died, but the nominal case is it's physically far away. In this case, because it's far away, you wanna enable crowd sourcing. it's relevant to understand the location of accessory when it's far away. it's close to a nearby near owner mode, crowd sourcing doesn't matter because it's physically close to you. So let's go to the Oh, yeah. Let's go to the next slide. Great. So building on a pa building on top of separated mode is the crowd an example of how the crowdsourcing network works. So, again, the tag and the phone are physically far apart. in this example. There are 3 finders, phones, laptops, watches, whatever that are operating in the same crowdsourcing network, The way this works is they typically works is they observe the Bluetooth advertisement from the tag That advertisement is formatted away or has information that says, I want to be crowdsourced. Furthermore, there there has to be ideally some sort of key ideally a rotating diversified public key or something like that. that as it rotates over time and each finder gets a new key, it's gonna take that key along with the finder's location, the phone's location. So the 3 separate devices here. encrypt that location with that key, and then publish both the key and that location to the server. then when the owner's phone wants to know, hey, where's my tag right now? We'll create a server for the the the set of keys that are valid at that time and maybe in the recent past, pulled on all the records from this server, associated with those keys, decrypt the locations because there's a maybe a private diverse provide set of keys that the owner's device has to. and then compute the best possible location from the set of locations that have been retrieved. Next, I'm gonna hand over to Tajinder who's online. Can you hear"

    "text": "Yep. But yeah. So one of the most important aspects about tags and their usage is also to prevent the unwanted tracking. And in this slide, we'll cover an overview architecture on how don't want to track us, and notify the users of potential tracking. As the nonowner, travels with the tag, their phone is running the background Bluetooth scans, to identify any unknown accessories. The non owner's phone keeps tracks of the addresses of the trackers that have been seen in a separated state. And if a tracker is in a separated state, seen continuously seen over the multiple multiple Bluetooth cans over the period of time and distance the non owner will receive the alert Now one of the key aspects to note here is we only send the alerts for the tags which are in a separated state. This is to minimize the false positives and all so, like, as Brent mentioned, like, there is notion that when the device when the tag is actually connected to the user's device, the rotation of the address is quite frequent. And while they are in a separated state, the tag is rotated. less frequently to assist for the unknown tracking. So once a tag is deemed or detected as an unknown tag, the non owner is alerted by a notification. The alert provides the details about the tags such as the image serial number, etcetera. It also provides a mechanism to ring the tag in order to locate it and further instructions on how to disable the tag, remove back rates, etcetera. With this, I'll hand it over back to Brent to fund the continuum. Thank you. Cool. Thanks to Cinder. we go to the next slide, please? Yes. Great.

I think this highlights a number of the interfaces and protocols that are relevant. and should be in scope within the the the charter and some that should not be. So just wanna name those particular interfaces and protocols right now because we're gonna revisit them later. In no particular order, item a is the Bluetooth advertisement that comes from the accessory. Item b is the the publishing of the encrypted locations to a server, Item c is the pulling down those encrypted locations from the owner device from the server to the owner device. Item d in the upper right is the the protocol for over Bluetooth to query information about the accessory, the make and model, etcetera. It capabilities? Does it support play sound or you would be finding or some other finding capability and also issue commands to the accessory to say start play playing sound. And finally, interface or protocol e is querying a server for ancillary information, things like the image, for the accessory text description on how to disable it, maybe a video on how to disable it. are things that are too big to normally store on the accessory itself and in able to build into all the the operating systems or apps. Furthermore, there's potentially a separate protocol for our serial number lookup. that happens over the Internet too. Alright. Cool. So we're gonna break now and go back to Erica. Okay. Yeah.

I'm the senior director of the safety net project at the National Network had domestic violence, And I'm gonna be talking just a moment about the the problem statement, the the problem issue that we're seeing. that we're hoping can be addressed. Bluetooth tracking trackers are being misused. As I know, you all know. There are being misused as a tactic of abuse to perpetrate harassment, stalking theft, domestic violence and and sexual assault. and we see our concern is about ability to be in control of our location privacy and our location information by the time someone finds that they have a tag or a that I I I sorry. I'm a little flusser trying to get it in trying to get in and give my mind back to this. by the time that somebody finds that there is a device that has been tracking them, with the current design and the current standard, it there's already exists a critical safety issue for many, many people. and this lack of standardized design right now and implementation of the of the devices. really allows for and facilitates this wide misuse. and creates significant safety concerns, especially grounds and sexual assault. move to the next slide, please."

So location tracking in the context of domestic violence, sexual assault, and location tracking is a incredibly common form of abuse and tactic of abuse that is not at all specific to Bluetooth trackers that has been a tactic of abuse for a very long time. Anyone who's been doing this work addressing domestic violence such as all talking and working with victims of crime knows that. I remember when odometers were it was something that of users would keep track of and just kind of watch the mileage of a car to see if somebody had viewered off and gone somewhere else during their day than their normal route. So the the concept of location tracking is one that any service provider working with victims of crime is very well. attuned to. The difference that exists now is the the accuracy, the real time ability for to be able to identify someone else's location. and to find them often without any notification or in information to the victim that this might be happening until, obviously, until it could be too late. Their location has been compromised, which in many situations for survivors, can be someplace they -- to, including a confidential domestic violence shelter. Location and safety are critically linked for survivors. And so from the perspective of advocates who are doing this work, know really well what the research says. And for decades, the research has said very clearly that at the point that somebody tries to start planning to leave and leaves. an abusive person. The that piece right there of planning to leave and actually leaving is the height of the of the most the most dangerous potentially time. It is the time when the most murders happen"

And so this is not a brand new topic, I'm sure, as it relates to Bluetooth technology. but these pieces, I put in here, like, question mark if it's helpful. The the issue is that without a better standardized universal response to detection, to alerts, to let people and survivors know of tracking before they already realize they're being tracked. Somebody knows too much. They found them. without something like that. All of this media and coverage tends to be a little bit more informative to abusive individuals than actually to survivors. It's very helpful that there are some safeguards, and we applauded apples, the the design to automatically from launch includes some safeguards into the into air tags.

This is not just a a question of a concern for safety. This is happening. We have been seeing it for a long time. trackers have been found in the lining of purses and bags and and jackets, And we've found in programs, I should say, local domestic violence advocates have found trackers, even inside toys. There was one shelter that found a tracker sewn inside the teddy bear. of a little kid whose parent flu fled. to to a shelter. heard probably of the of the the cases. We've all the lawsuits that have made the news. But on a day to day basis, this is something advocates and service providers are seen, and they're trying to work around with survivors, and they're really struggling with that. Next slide. Thank you. So the challenge for survivor with this is that, you know, there are a lot of ways that that location can be tracked In today's age, there's a a significantly a growing list of ways that abusers can track down and identify somebody's location and find somebody. And so the it becomes incredibly overwhelming, especially at a very critical time when somebody is experiencing a lot of trauma and a lot of across, it's very hard to think straight. And the current the current design that people will download different apps to try to find and detect different types of trackers. is incredibly burdensome and problematic and just not a reasonable expectation for people who are not in a stressful situation.

Even though I was sitting, I did this scan many, many times and never detected the unwanted tracker that was with me. within a foot of where I was at every single scan. But the the idea that not only is it not finding the tracker when it says that it's going to, but that I actually get a notice on my phone that you're safe is really problematic. It sets a false sense of security for survivors, and it sends them down to rabbit hole trying to figure out other possibilities for how the person's finding their location. when it still actually could be a tracker. So there's a real need for universal standards and design. to address this issue. We also hear all the time that shelters especially those that are confidential location shelters. are really struggling to figure out how to address this. They are I seeing situations with survivors are coming into a shelter. find tracker in their bags, in their belongings that the survivor didn't know was there. And then the shelter is concerned not only about that one individual safety and the abuse coming after them but they're then concerned about the safety of everyone the shelter. And so they are figuring out how to handle that, and many shelters have to pay out to try to put the that survivor in a hotel. or figure out an alternative for them.

I wanted to go back to one of the points you made earlier, which is this is one of a a field of location tracker issues, right, that The Bluetooth location trackers are among other location trackers and one of the most significant of those is trucking of a target's phone. And it's it's my experience No. No. My experience. It is my understanding that one of the most common things to happen is a stalker or potential abuser will compromise a phone of the person they wish to stock in order to install tracking software or otherwise prevent the person from hiding their location from the abuser the proposed architecture here because it is based on a detection by phones will require somebody who wants to understand if there are unwanted Bluetooth trackers to have a phone that performs that function. Is that acceptable as a core design principle given that risk. That's a that's a really excellent question. So I think that one of the things you're talking about, there's a number of that people of users manipulate and and abuse somebody's phone as a tactic to try to find them. 1 thing you might be talking about is the use of stalkerware. I think with the cove the media coverage around Stalkerware and the level of concern that we have seen, you almost get a sense happens a lot more frequently than it actually does. Stalkerware is a concern, and that is leads,"

Anything outside of stock wear is usually a lot more easy for a service provider and a survivor to through and to identify. Stalkerware is the biggest concern that is that is incredibly challenging to navigate. However, that said, it's also much more unlike to actually be something that somebody is misusing. There are some there's a clinic at to Entekabees at Cornell. and a couple other clinics that specifically have been designed to help individualized tech support with survivors to identify stock wear and other types of tech misuse. And over and over and over again, they have found that a number of times people think that stalker might be on their device. but the abuser's actually finding their information through another means. And overall, we hear about Bluetooth location trackers, devices that happens to earn for it. actually happening at a much greater extent than than Stalkerware. And so there is going to be a concern, of course if they're stuck around a device that the abuser would be alerted to anything that's happening on that device, but it is it is absolutely something that we can navigate around in terms of that process of individualizing the safety plan. with person, and you can if you have another device, a very, very common suggestion for survivors who are concerned about the abuser misusing their technology. is to get another device."

I hope that makes sense, but we would we we do work with survivors when they are concerned about both location tracking, for example, and Stalkerware. we would work with survivors and programs every day working with survivors. to identify alternative devices that would allow them to do that scan. or to have a different device on them to receive a proactive alert. that would not be the same device. I think that that would be we would still really really want to see an universal design. that helps with this issue even if stock wear continues to exist. you for that response. I it does seem like this issue will need to be Thank considered as well for people who do not access to a phone like small children, especially given the point you made about somebody's sewing it into a child's toy.

Then there's other vendors who have proprietary solutions who are tracking stolen items it's handled differently, and they're using different means to deter that type of activity by placing large fines and tight identity ties. I think it's too difficult to try to scope all those together, and you can't force people to implement a standard. And then the other one is children and elderly. I have a parent with dementia.

The next one is proactive alerts. I think this is really critical to not have us to not just have a solution you have to manly even worse. Download a bunch of apps and then manly press a bunch of buttons to for something around you, having your phone or an app working in the background, to help you determine if something is traveling with you and you're not having to do any thing yourself is critical. This requires background, blue scanning, of course, and a number of other things where we've already talked about and we'll talk about. you need to learn more about the accessories. Some people may not know what you know, what a tile is, what an air tag is, what a Chipolo is. having the make and model, an image of it, some text description is really helpful. And then, of course, you typically need to find it. Either that's play sound, either you'd be finding Bluetooth r's as I find number of techniques there. And then, finally, you may wanna get the serial number It could be printed on the product that, of course, could be easily damaged or destroyed. electronic means to get the serial number too. the case where you wanna go back to the company that provided it or potentially law enforcement to follow-up. Now talking through the columns, There's 2 operating level operating system level solutions. one from Apple, the one from Google. You know, I'm not gonna go through the specifics check marks there, but lots of green at least on these columns. There are definitely more columns than these, but for this set of important columns, lots of green, that's good. The downside to those solutions is what's called out in the far right, which accessories they support today. Apple's system"

We get somebody yeah. You have one question from. Go ahead. Hi. Hopefully, a quick question. Just on the deterrent part is there what evidence is there that this kind of does anything because my my view would be someone is intent on tracking someone illegally, telling them you're doing crime is going to do absolutely nothing. So may what evidence is that that this does anything so should we be prioritizing that over other things or That's a good question. I don't have data to back up if a excuse me, a text description at time of pairing. telling me about the bad things that could happen to you if that actually prevents people from doing bad things. We do know that having a pairing registry"

Thanks. Go ahead, Jocelyn. Hello, Adi. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Alright. Thank you. Well, thank you for the the opportunity to to talk about our approach to antistocking prevention, antistocking, basically. we have a feature called the Scan and Secure. So I'm gonna talk about this, and it's a high level in production. And I also wanna say, it's a it's a work in progress. So we we we still have a long way, I think, to to readdress the the issues, which is quite important as has been nicely explained. So the the approach that we have in our mobile application it's it's a feature. So you no styling is required. You have to install the application. That's one of the the limitation, I think, of not, you know, opening a platform. So the the way we propose to to scan here is a a manual. Go just scan, is a person wanting to check, and it's able to do this using the app. And so the this app this feature in our app is gonna check for tiles. entire partner accessories. So after the guide is scanned, basically, there there would be a page. showing the results. with some product information, like a picture and the some information about the the model And then that That result can be saved. shared,"

Some of the So the this this feature is already released, but some of the features we would like to add we are considering adding. The background scan, that's been mentioned already.

But but want to avoid having daily reasons in terms of notifications for everybody. So that's a trade off. then ring the ticket tiles.

Is that true? What is the point of having detection if someone can turn it off? Good you hear me? Can We can't -- Oh, I can hear you. Okay. That's a very good question. So there is a feature to disabled tracking with a warning in the the scan and secure application. and some other conditions, that that including identity verification and the other parameters, parameters, So that's an accurate statement.

So I think we should probably focus here on clarifying questions of what was presented so that we can get to the part about Should we standardize something? Alright. So I'm gonna take a moment to now that we understand, like, what the general problem space is, to be more explicit about the threat model we're considering? and what scenarios are in scope at all. so we can go to the next slide. So the top level threat we keep talking about is a stalker using a location accessory to engage in unwanted tracking. And what we're lacking right now is a standardized crop cross platform in interoperable way. for victims or the targets of unwanted tracking, to detect what is happening to them. I want to take a second to walk through a lot of But specific scenarios that could happen that would make it hard for the victim to discover that they're being back And then I'll also mention the proposed mitigations from the Internet draft that would address each of those bets. So the first thing is the victim not being aware at all of unwanted"

It's in your bag. that your phone gets an alert that something has been following you. And the proposed mitigation here is having stable Bluetooth addresses That way a any platform is able to detect something following the them. But then if a victim does get a learner alert, we wanna be mindful that they might need help finding it. This has been the for suggesting things like the ability to place sound on item, or alternate finding hardware. The victim, might also find themselves in a situation where they are aware of and an increased level of risk to themselves They're aware of their own life circumstances or someone who might be targeting them So they might want the ability to not just get alerts but proactively search for them. Having interoperability and this a consistent way of broadcasting would make it easier to have the ability to scan for items so the target who expects something can proactively look. target or the victim The Similar to someone who knows they might get increased risk, might also have a suspicion of who the person tracking them is. And so we also want to want them to have the ability to identify that person. They shouldn't just find history where it came from. and they might need to take recourse in their lives.

Having the serial number visible on the accessory available over NFC or Bluetooth, and maintaining a pairing registry of the serial number with with the identity of the owner of the device the mitigations we've proposed to address this that. And then and then Finally, there is the target not being like, finding the device And, like, once you found it, you don't wanna just, like, know that it's been tracking you. wanna be able to turn it off. And so we also want to make sure we consider, like, how you get the thing, to turn off and stop reporting location. Also going to you I realized I skipped 1 in the middle. That was very important, so I'm gonna run back up to it. which is If you're the victim and for whatever reason you are unable to receive an alert, we still want you to be able to find the tracker. And so these are people who might not have a device that supports giving the alerts Maybe it's in a bag or a jacket that wasn't near the phone or the device able to detect the Bluetooth advertisements, maybe the phone was off or away, And in that case, we still want there to be some some suggestion that the accessory is with you.

I heard it in the audience. I heard I heard the air tag deep going. Someone was doing play sound. And the teddy bear would start like screaming the little air tag jingle. And then while our main focus is on enabling victims to find that are being used to track them, We also want to mention that we don't want to introduce new risk of tracking by third parties with Bluetooth scanning abilities across physical distance. So this could be this could include tracking the owner or the target With either the Bluetooth advertisement, or the serial number broadcast. And so we think we've proposed address rotation to mitigate this risk. So someone who puts a scanner at the bus stop, and across the mall can't identify the same person broadcasting the same thing at those two different locations. I will finally mention that there's additional risk if accessories are hacked, or if manufacturers do not implement This the same kind of Bluetooth advertisement in a standardized way. But I want to emphasize that the biggest threat here is is allowing victims to find the accessories that are, like, today in the wild being used to track people without any standardized or interoperable way of victims detecting due to accessories. So those might be threats that we address in the future. So I have a question, and I once again lost Internet activities.

So can you would you consider that is an additional threats, you know, tracking based on any field. That's -- Yeah. I think that that is a great point and we don't wanna consider tracking just based on the address. We also wanna consider tracking on payload stability. So, that's a great point. Thanks. Oh oh, I can see the calendar. Okay. Yeah. Harry. Hi. This is Harry with live 360.

Yeah. That's a good point. But we're really focusing on giving platforms the ability to even detect the accessories at all, And so I think it's a little it is out of scope or for another conversation, how the actual detection logic works. there's a lot of additional additional considerations there totally. But, like, the definitely, the emphasis is on, can they even be detected at all? Right. I'm not not to get too technical, but I'm just saying that if we if we don't speak about that, when when this thing does get rolled out, and it's an annoyance. it might not have as much as an uptake as if it didn't.

So, I mean, I think we're gonna talk about the scope later, so I'm not gonna take that right now. But I just wanna point out that I think that this last two last two points are, like, not quite as clear as one might like. It's not just a matter of non interior manufacturers say, that, you know, someone that starts a new network and doesn't adhere. is also the problem of noninter manufacturers of of tags which work within the existing network. So to understand is that the threshold is not created by on by this is the tag description. This is the tracking network itself. and the reason and and the fact and the tracking network sort of makes it possible to have a cheap device that is used to use resource restocking. Right? And so if I can build a device which works with say Apple's network, but does not follow this this thing that is useful for stalking, and then these things work. And so and so it's a sort of a very different accessory hacker. So I just wanna fly. There's not, like, The the point here is not that, like, I might build entirely if I can never practices have been violated is that I'm able to tag cheaply that someone interoperates. Yeah. I think you're totally right. That's a real risk and, like, definitely One of the things we're trying to capture here that people can take advantage of that on the network.

And I'm really worried about the the unintended consequences of of deploying something like that. The whole point of rotating mac addresses and hiding the serial number is to prevent people from stalking you while you're carrying your keys. So if we go and start advertising these things, We've we're back to the same place we started. This is in credibly counterproductive if we enable stalking while attempting to fight stalking. Yeah. So totally agree. And that's why we included like, second set of risks around, like, the 3rd party scanner. And, like, the mitigation we proposed here of, like, you know, against, like, an owner being tracked across space, like, because they're broadcasting their serial number, are two things both that you need to take a physical action in order to initiate the broadcast, So you're not just wandering around with, like, an air type, like, screaming its cell phone numb or its serial number out. It only happens if someone finds the physical object and takes a specific action, And we've also proposed encrypting it. So definitely, We acknowledge that's a real risk and do not want to introduce something in the name of safety that just further jeopardizes other people. And and, I mean, I bring this up because this is a real example of something that happened with a certain shoe manufacturers fitness device, and and that was a real problem.

That's, I think, mostly in scope. item d, where you're You're doing the Bluetooth interface and the the non owner device. to pull down attributes, capabilities, and then issuing commands like play sound, user actions that I believe should be in scope.

Some of these accessories today probably can't be former updated even if can be firmware updated. We need to be very mindful of the fact that they have very little memory They have long battery life. So any new protocol that we define need to be very conscious of that to make them still act as as effective products. And then the other consideration, which is called out at least in the Internet draft. I don't think we called it out in the charter. is there's probably discrimination we wanna consider on things like a small 20 or $30 location tracker. and a 1000 plus dollar bicycle. One of those is very easy to surreptitiously. Plans at someone, the other one is a little bit more challenge Next slide, please. Just laughing. So you know, the proposal for the program of work is standardize those interfaces we talked about and 2 slides ago visually. I think we also wanna specify practices. This is important wording here on things like deterrence in the pairing registry, it is not intended to be in scope to implement and design a pairing registry. but more along the lines of recommendations to companies that are implementing tracking networks that this is a helpful thing to do. So some wording and best practices around That is what's intended by the major bullet 2.

Other people mentioned it, there's You prietary blob there. What's needed for unwanted tracking to reliable detection and to support the actions like play sound is the first 15 bytes, 0 214. the blob is was left there because I understand that manufacturers we understand manufacturers may wanna put additional information in. to support things like crowdsource finding. One really clear example of that is the encryption keys crowd source find out quite long.

But since some of the protections that we're building in to this specification are covered by Apple inventions, we wanted to make sure that we're fully complying with Apple's IETF IPR policy. by disclosing and making a Iran commitment and just being totally transparent. that we are making available for license, any patents that Apple does have, that might be needed to implement this standard. So, you know, as the bullet says here, you know, we we did submit disclosures of the patents that that we thought might be"

I'd like to highlight another perspective on on this whole effort The main drawback from a product point of view of each of these trackers is that it's limited to its own ecosystem. What we're doing here with very good intentions and very good reasons. is break down some of these walls between the ecosystems. and call me paranoid, but I think that once we start doing that, the next step could very well be that the world's taken down. and we end up with the universal tracking network."

And then when we talk about what's out of scope I guess, is that choose slides from now? There is the case that was brought up before I think Ecker brought up of you have a know, someone who's legitimately in Apple's Find My Network who, you know, just does you like, a badge offer.

You know, everyone around all the devices around us see this thing. is not near its owner and it's rotating super frequently. Like, that looks really sketchy. Let's all report that.

I am concerned about this scope statement, statement, putting the actual third party tracking network thing out of scope seems like I'm thaked me, What happens in that 3rd party tracking network is gonna have significant implications on who can be tracked in in different ways, and I think we need to be thinking about that. I think it's a mistake to to to define that out of scope, although I understand you know, from an engineering perspective, we'd like to have byte sized problems. And I also just wanted to highlight that the device registration, the pairing registration thing, No. has significant other concerns. If I can grab somebody's bag and it happens to have a tag in it, and then suddenly I can take that information and go to the pairing registry and get information about who that person is that's a that's another problem that we don't wanna be creating as we attempt to solve these problems.

I And from reading the charter, it wasn't clear to me if mechanisms to disable trackers were out scope. I mean, they may be advisable or inadvisable, but and maybe part of a for a particular proposal or not, but I wasn't clear to me if they're in the scope with the charter or not. like, to disable trackers at a shelter location or at someone's home when they don't use trackers by no beaconing, crowdsourcing, suppression begin or something. Do you want do you wanna speak to him? Yeah. I can so how do I think I think there's two ways that I think about that. One is if you have physical access to the tracker, you definitely wanna have a way to disable it. I don't think those disablement mechanisms need to be is a protocol in within scope of the charter, but certainly that the Charter should in or short should cover that there's a way to disable it if you have all access. And we need to make that very clear. So so for physical access, I'd say that it's often too late. It's already reported you. if you think about, like, at my home, I don't want anyone in Strackers, you know, if they get dropped off their reporting back or a shelter, for example. So you might imagine a mechanism where you have a device persistently broadcasting, don't report, don't report at this location. a mechanism that could exist. Maybe a bad idea. It might be a good idea. But I think it should discussion if it should be perhaps in scope for the the working group. k. k. Yep.

I think the charter written is eliminating a whole bunch of ways of thinking about it and focusing ways. As Erica Skorla pointed out earlier, the functional mechanism that this work by is having a device with a network interface that other nearby systems can detect and which then collude provide a certain amount of information to an upstream database. instead of Looking at that, this this proposes setting up a different proximity based network to inform other approximate users that this is the case. And I believe by ruling out any solution which focuses on the first set approximate devices and their information sent up to this database. It is eliminating a a set of possible answers here, which might be both simpler and more appropriate to avoid other kinds of tracking I I'm very much aware of the the concerns that Danielle Con Gilmore has raised and I agree with them.

So On the one hand, I think this is a very important and serious problem. It has been 5 number of people. On your hand, I think that this approach is not good.

So saying a microphone So I think the first point I like to make is that, as I think DKG pointed out, this proprietary blob is a critical part of the privacy surface. mean, I'm not looking I understand what's in proprietary blog. It's completely possible with properties of the system are in his privacy. And so rolling that out of scope, Simply, like, does not give you any assurance whatsoever. The out resulting system has any privacy whichever. And I think you've been you you've done a little bit of hand waving about what one might save at the proprietary blog. but, like, You know, I think attempting to create some set of description about that and requirements extremely difficult to persuade yourself that that those rules are sufficient to provide privacy. So, I mean, you know, you said won't mean it's not static, but what if but, like, gee, maybe it's, like, rotating on a on a on a fixed predictable pattern or whatever. So, like, trying to to describe that, I think, is gonna be very difficult. second, as I pointed out earlier with the microphone, You know, I think we have to deal with the problem of nonconforming devices, as I said, the issue here is created by the existence of this colluding network, not by the tags themselves. On and while, you know, step 0, no doubt, will be know, if we it would be in fact to a huge improvement if the commercially available devices will conform it with this protocol. because of my protocol, the absolute next step will be someone goes and fabs a bunch $2 devices that comply with the protocol in terms of being findable but do not comply with these things."

The defense suspension clause in here that basically says, you know, that that you can't implement this without promising never to sue Apple kind of patent infringement. then you have to make a licensing fee, like, double the reason the bill. So if the IETF has to adopt this, really, this had the ran z term, not these ran Finally, I wanna tie those two points together. which is We we endpoint game here. is to design a system. that when totally put together. provides privacy for the user. And has to include or not we standardize those, proprietary blog things that actually enable tracking providing meaningful privacy. And and In order to do that, that has to be patent free. And so if that is all entire out of scope of the charter, and that's his out of scope for Idle's patent commit it's not clear that one could even do that. is possible that every possible way of doing that reads as well on map as patents. And so put those together, the point is that hired things in the end of the script to pull in those patent commitments. So I think it's very they're close.

I think the challenge though. is if we ignore the other use cases that we might break them to solve this use case. So on the one hand, we need it to be very tightly focused to make it solvable.

So that's you know, part of the reason why this defensive suspension clause is there and, you know, the sort of ran commitment that we're making here is is very typical and standard setting context.

If you do not please select do not raise hand. Alright. Going once. invoice. Mhmm. Weirdo. Uh-huh. Yes. 34 raised hands the one did not raise hand. for a total of 95. Okay. Yeah. Why don't we Just can you go to the next slide and then put the pull up so people don't confused. Sorry."

Okay. Okay. So given that, obviously, we had a lot of discussion about potentially different scopes for this starter, including bringing in the whole finder network, different use cases, attestation, and so on. We wanted to just get a sense of whether their support to work on a charter that addresses some of the problems discussed today. that has a broader scope. You know we're gonna call on you. once, going twice, going Just in case it wasn't a joke, does somebody really wanna get the microphone and say why? No. 0 Not seriously. it was a joke, just say it was a joke and If can go on good. You actually, you don't have to say anything. Never mind. I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay. So for the record, that was 97 hands raised, and one hand did did not get raised. Okay. Then I think we have one more question. So this is the opposite question. if you feel I'm ready for that. I'm ready for them. We're getting the ball."

    "text": "Sorry? Today, why don't we say, like, today. I don't know. We're we're not getting that much additional information at point, but, like, it's in the it's in the RFC, so we're asking the question. if you feel that a working group. Actually actually no. Let's do this differently. Let's do this differently. Sorry. Sorry. Alright. Stop the pool. Stop the pool. I think I think we should do, like, that the IETF shouldn't do work in this area. Is that Useful? Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Are you volunteering? in this area see how much people love that. present. Yeah. No. because I think we already got that. That's that's what the last question was. Right? That was we're trying to ask the opposite question. Okay. So if you feel the IETF should not do work in this area. Stop. This is it's a bad idea. We don't need to address this problem space. there's too many downsides, whatever reason you think. You should raise your hand. Otherwise, you can do not raise hand. I better be a different person. Okay. Alright. Alright. Michele. Going once. My place. My place. Alright. We're done. So there were 3 raised hands for that and 93 not raised. Does anybody who raise their hand wanna go ahead and talk about it. Looking for?"

So I think it presupposes that the the question presupposes that the IETF results will be effective for the participants that need to be involved. And so while security clue and the networking clue, and we can argue that going over the Internet and so somehow we're involved. and we have working group about doing things over Bluetooth, I remain unconvinced that We have the right set of people who are actually going to implement. So I think most of us our guests are not gonna be in a position to implement any of this, and I'm not convinced we have running code people in the room. I'd love to be wrong, but That's why I'm didn't raise my hand. hard. Didn't not whatever. Thank you. That's helpful. Thanks. Joel? Joel Yagley. Raise my hand because I've gone back and forth on this, but Like, ultimately, pervasive monitoring is an attack. I do not see how these platforms can we safely used without enabling that functionality. and I don't think we should be a participant in that. Thank you. Roman over to you. Hello, everyone. So I'm a security area AD kind of overseeing this box. So I just wanted to wrap up all conversation that we had realizing, wow, there was a diversity kind of a feedback here. So the first thing I wanna say kinda top line thank you for all the new participants that came IETF to discuss what is very, very clear as an important topics. So thank you, kind of, for coming here. And I realized there"

    "text": "a lot of perspectives on this. So the other thing I very much appreciate is the level of professionalism with which we were able to have this conversation to figure out figure out ultimately what what to do here. And lastly, of course, a lot of flexibility on how we kinda kicked it off with how some of the IT is working. in balance with how we did this poll, I think we have a pretty strong kinda signal on on what to do what to do next. You know, I will colloquially say, I think what I heard from from the various polls is that there is strong interest to do work on something in this space in the IETF. but what we should not do is exactly what we presented here. And so there is a need to step back a little bit and fine exactly kind of how to approach this problem. how to kind of scope it appropriately. But what I did here very, very strongly is that that's there are people in this room that wanna continue kind of to work on that problem. they are willing to do that. These were kind of very kind of large numbers. And what I also heard was that there is interest the implementation side. So I think what we have here is a very successful bot. the sense that it's indicated that there is interest to work on this very hard problem. And what we gotta do is step back refactor, and it get the scope exactly right. And I think in the the the follow-up steps are please join the mailing list. Let's continue kind of having this conversation. I won't kind of say anything kinda beyond that to kinda preclude what those next might be, but it's clearly gonna be charter iteration to find find the right way to approach this in the IT Thank you for everyone's kind of engaging me on this very, very important topic. Thanks. thumb You get the last word. I know. Sorry. Yep. if I can just summarize what the previous person said, I think it would be great to have another buff. I think it's a very interesting topic. I think we're a long way from actually being ready to form a working group because we don't really know what we're going to do yet. And we we can do something that is actually makes the world better or just different. I'm not sure yet. Thanks. Thanks, everyone."
