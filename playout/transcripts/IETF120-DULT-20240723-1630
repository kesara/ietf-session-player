Well, this is the policies and procedures for operating in the IATI It's a lot about like IPR policy So if you know something about it, you gotta say something about it If I know something about it, I'm going to report it So you know, you can do third party disclosures in all nine yards And then a bunch of other policies about, you know, any harassment procedures, go to conduct, etc. Basically, let's just try to keep a professional. Just kind of want to remind everybody again that like you know we're not here to bash products, you know, that's kind of not the point. We're all trying to hear to try to make it a little bit better Next one is note really well it's about you know trying to make sure that we have a good environment we just kind of want to stress this point that, you know, if you're feeling harassed her feeling unsafe in any way, we have people in place that can help with that. You can ask me you can ask area directors, we have an obud's team whole bunch of stuff Meeting tips We have a really big room with not a lot of people. But I still need you to use the in-person or the on-site meeting tool and scan this QR code because that I make sure that we get a properly sized room so that we don't get squeezed out in a time little room. And the other thing is we're going to use this to model the queue because we have some people that are remote So when you're up here, if you're presenting, you'll see there's a queue that's running through here and I can help manage it, but it's the way you can get in and out of the line. So it's good good as I've discussed earlier with somebody sometimes it's a little hard to do it on your phone, but it'd be great if we could get going All right, so the agenda, this is the fun part. I need a scribe I need somebody to take notes So I would love it if someone could volunteer. I don't need word for word. What I need is you know, basically general topic, what we talked about, summary"

So if you want to help, that'd be great. You can jump on there. So basically our agenda is pretty sure straightforward. We're going to do a little recap Do a quick thing over the goals, I'll do that Then we're going to go through the threat model, because again, we have four documents So we'll do document four first then we'll do document one, two which as you'll note, you can time to get famous if you want to write this, and three, and then we'll do a discussion and wrap up. So unless there's anything else that anyone wants to add to that, we can just kind of get into it it Go on once, go on twice. All right, let's get into it. All right, so the recap for today is again, we're in the, you know, trying to detect unwanted location trackers, you know, it's those little devices or little things that can, like, get dropped in your purse, you know, and somebody can track you and you might not want to be tracked. Did you want to be know if you're being tracked? know if you're being tracked. So that's really it Where we're at the point now where we have a working group, the idea is that we have individual drafts and after we review them and make sure that they're in good enough shape, they don't need to be completely finished, then we can adopt them as a working group, and then we can get to work on actually getting the standards done. So that's kind of the big process. The goal for today is to review whatever drafts we have and see if they're in a good enough shape to do it starting point, and then we can do a working group call for adoption which will law about two weeks. I might start it, you know, we have and see if they're in a good enough shape as a starting point and then we can do a working group call for adoption, which will law about two weeks. I might start it later in August because I know like Europe doesn't work in August so we can get input from everyone and then get see if the documents can be adopted and then we'll just move on it. We have a GitHub repo that we set up You'll note there's not a lot in there right now, it's just working group materials where we put the architecture that we've agreed to to start discussing when the working group drafts get,"

Is anybody have any questions about that? Awesome, great. So there have been two drafts that were pumped out and I know that a link to the third draft was sent out How many people have read the drafts? All right, I'm seeing like six years seven hands. Erica? yes Oh, sorry. I was just raising my hand that I read them Oh, okay, yeah. I'm responding to your question There is a raise hand tool, but I think it throws you in Okay queue.

So I never further protocol to be successful we need to have a good understanding of the unwanted tracking threat model. So our document, includes the taxonomy of unwanted tracking that Jesse made what we think should be in and out of scope with respect to attackers and victims. This is something we really want feedback from other people on.

So we're going to talk about active scanning and passive scanning. So active scanning is when a search for location trackers is manually initiated by a user, which is different from passive scanning, where a user just is notified if a platform detect something is following them. And then tracking tag we're defining that as a small concealable device that broadcast location data to other devices Next slide, please Okay, so I'm going to turn just over to Jesse for these next couple slides Hey, everybody so the taxonomy that I created, this is insane as mentioned in the direction so the taxonomy that I created, this is inspired as mentioned in the draft by a month other things, the models of applied privacy paper the taxonomy is not left wholesale from any of that because that particular model is meant for organizational and enterprise level considerations, but its flexibility I think is useful for being able to generate personas for purposes of threat modeling And so the taxonomy in this case we're looking at expertise level made this pretty simple Someone can either be expert or non-expert and in this case we're talking about the abuser, the stalker the person doing the unwanted tracking I used the standard cybersecurity terms here of attacker and target proximate"

And this isn't includes when attacker and a victim are separated but are co-parenting a child because you know in the anti anti-domestic violence field, we unfortunately see a lot of situations where, you know, abusers do use children as ways to get access to device that will then be in physical proximity of the victim, you know, low would be lack of access access to resources. So this is you know, what external resources can the attacker use? you know, such as hiring a hacker having, you know, a lot of money to spend? um, anything that could engage their capacity beyond what they would have with their own skill and the resources that they own low would be that the attacker does not have access to these resources Next slide And then victim"

So this is when the attacker is used the victim's own tag in some way to track this And then attacker and victim is the hybrid situation where both control one or more tracking tags. Next slide example scenarios. We talked through these at the last meeting What is in the draft is pretty much taken from the slides that we showed at that meeting. You can see example scenarios in document four or in the previous presentation So I see there's a question, how do victim use a tracking tag offensively? That's not necessarily what I am referring to, what I'm thinking about here is a scenario where a victim has a tracking tag for legitimate use purposes, such as being able to track a phone or keys in case they get lost, and the attacker has compromised the victim's tag in some way"

Next slide. I'll turn it back over to Maggie Thanks, Jesse. Yeah, so just you know, I kind of tried to brainstorm what kinds of things that we think are in scope and some of this has already been discussed since in like some of the previous internet draft and some of this is new stuff that we came up with, so we want people feedback on it. So in terms of technology, I think this is something that we've agreed on for a while so basically any easily concealable accessory is able to broadcast this location to other consumer devices. Most of the time, we're assuming this is Bluetooth. There's a little bit about NFC in one of the dots In terms of the attacker profiles, we're assuming that any attacks that use platform native tracking applications are in scope. So basically, you know, if you're just opening up your Find My app or equivalent on any other platform and using that, that's in scope Attacks that include physical modification of a track tag, for example, trying to disable a speaker And then non-nation state level alterations to firm or deployment of custom devices. We weren't really sure of like a better way to phrase this, so we're definitely interested in some feedback on that But basically the idea is, you know, if it's a person with some basic level of expertise, but they don't necessarily have like, access to celebrate or, you know, any of these kinds of technologies that can crack encryption those kinds of things, we assume that some of that is in scope. So basically, like, if, you know, they just deploy their own custom tag, that's considered in scope In terms of the victim profiles, we think they should basically all be in scope. Next slide please. In terms of what we propose, is out of scope, so technologies that, you know,"

    "text": "it's had a really a big device, even if it uses Bluetooth, we consider that out of scope. App-based technologies like Parent-Dil, monitoring apps, so it doesn't involve some sort of location tag We consider that to be out of scope. We consider connected cars to be out of scope and then cloud services or social media We also consider those to be out of scope In terms of the attacker profiles, if someone is able to crack encryption or something like that, we've probably consider that out of scope. We'd probably also consider someone jailbreaking a victim's device to be out of the scope, and for victim profiles, we should say in slash a for that one. Next slide, please In terms of kind of some overall design considerations these are intentionally pretty vague because we want them to be able to apply to all different parts of the diagram of the 10 different parts of the protocol But so we think that it's really important that the protocol includes a variety of approaches to address different scenarios. In particular, we think it's really important that they include active and passive scanning right now there's a more focus on passive scanning, but we think active scanning is a big one to incorporate In addition to notification for sounds, basically for people who, especially for someone who might not have access to a device We also think that the you know, we need to account for scenarios in which the attacker has higher expertise, proximity, or access to resources within the scope previously defined, and the same thing for us scenarios in which the victim has low expertise, access to resources and our access to the actual safeguards again within scope. An additional, this is something that been talked about a bunch in the other documents, which is trying to do this all in a way that avoids privacy compromises for the tag owner when protecting against unwanted location tracking using tracking tags. Next slide, please I think that might be the last one. That's it Yep. Okay, thank you All right, so the way I want to frame this discussion is, have we started to think about the right things that need to go in the document?"

I had one specific comment. The slide about what's not in scope It's the, there was the one about Atterscope, like people who can jail break yeah that one it's really easy to find I just did it myself, you type in you know, how to disable a speaker and an air tag there's like a million links to that, so it's very it doesn't take a very sophisticated person to be able to figure out how to do that. So I think that should be in scope Yeah just to respond to that, it is in scope If you go to the previous slide, attacks that include physical modifications of a tracking tag. So that I agree with you. That should be in its scope so I think that will be covered by that one agreed and also I think that that is important case to consider because, for instance, a victim who is deaf or hard of hearing might not be able to hear a sound anyway, and so it would be important to have some of them means beyond only sound alerting someone someone someone Nick? nick doty, Jennifer for Democracy and Technology.

And so I think that line is fuzzy and definitely something to consider Yeah, to that law enforcement point, I'm not suggesting that we add requirements for if you are a tracker manufacturer, this is how you interact with law enforcement, but that we should consider the potential threats of a compromise of one of those states which might be through, yeah internal attacker or compelled access So, Nick, just a quick question. Do you think? that needs to be in the draft before it's adopted, or do you think the draft could be adopted and that could be added later? We have a kind of a verbal agreement that it gets in there because we're always like you know, in the IETF, we always always stand in this weird line like, oh, is there enough? in there to adopt it or not so i'm just curious on your opinion on this this i i am constantly confused by that question um stand in this weird line like, oh, is there enough in there to adopt it or not?

So we're going to kind of go over that in this talk as well And I did put it in my draft But if we think that some of the things that I bring up should be moved to Maggie and Jesse's draft and that my draft should only contain the technical architecture proposal, that's also fine.

So reiterating the motivation, and I actually took this directly from a research paper that was just presented by Alex Heinrich from T. Darmstadt, and I thought it really made a lot of sense to include here. So there's been stalking incidents using unwanted tracking with these Bluetooth trackers and it's been documented to have happened by intimate partners parents, and criminals. It's been seen in many major news outlets, and in at least three cases the unwanted tracking resulted in the death of the tracked victim So that's, you know, just reiterating why it's so important for us to address this Oh, thanks for sharing the link, Maggie Next slide So this was the kind of architecture that we had talked about at IETF-19 that we had talked about at IETF 119. So I wanted to include that here for posterity but I was going to explain it in a little bit more of an easy way to understand. But there are kind of five components to it. So there's the accessory trackers themselves There is a trackered network or crowdsource tracking framework that the tracker is able to somehow be tracked by and that's how we're going to define. And then there is devices on that network. And so there's really three kinds of devices. There's owner devices that can pull location from the crowdsource tracking framework. There's non-"

And then there's all the non-owner device that an unintentional finder, so it's somebody who may be their personal devices for some reason lending to this unwanted tracking so that's a fit element And so we talked about 10 different states and things that were in scope for the design. And so, my draft is addressing one, two, nine, and ten. So if we go to the next slide Oh, I'm sorry, just for everyone else who might not be following along, we use these numbers to figure out how we divvied up the doc, how we divvied up each part of it, which goes into which document. So if you look on the agenda, you'll see one comma 279, that's all related to what's being done where And there definitely is too, like some overlap So I'm going to go back to what this document is focusing on and i'm going to explain exactly what one two nine and ten is but there is overlap between my documents, some of the other documents, and especially the accessory protocol because the accessory protocol is such a huge portion of the crowdsource network architecture that they have to work in concert with each other in order for this to actually provide some type of location mechanism. So the current state of unwanted tracking, there are existing products on the market There's air tags from Apple Samsung Galaxy Smart Tags There's also third-party company. So there is Kyle, which has their own tracking network But then there's companies like Chippelo and other third parties that actually leverage Apple Spires Kyle, which has their own tracking network. But then there's companies like Chippelo and other third parties that actually leverage Apple's fine my framework.

Next slide Okay, so we don't have the animations, but that's okay. So just that's okay. So just to kind of simple the overall functionality. So there's some kind of accessory that I referred to in the documentation as ACC, then there is the finder device or FD In all of the implementations, there's some type of crowdsource network I'm calling CN and has a set central server. So the accessory, is beckoning some type of information over Bluetooth. The accessory itself does not have GPS capability, however it will beacon one implementation is a public key. In some implementations, it's a private ID. There's different things that they beacon. And then whatever that protocol has chosen to beacon is received by the finder device. The finder device takes that information that it received and it takes its own GPS location because it's a phone so it has GPS capability It will package that up in some way In some way, some implementations is encrypted and some implementations it is not and it uploads that to a central server so that it can later be queried by the owner and so the owner is able to pull down that location information So next slide So just reiterating the current existing infrastructure out there"

So these are the, to my knowledge, the existing infrastructure that we have that would need to be modified, but that doesn't mean that other companies aren't also working on these existing infrastructures Next slide So the scope of this document is specific enrolling in a crowdsource network and so I would assume that this is both for the excess and then also I think that it should be optional whether or not somebody's device is a finder currently iPhones and gals devices don't have an option to not be finders. So if you have an iPhone your phone is uninterested acting as a finder in this network So this is something that is in this scope of this document. Additionally, the access for broadcast presence because that information is part of location reporting and location querying. So on the next slide, I break down if we go to the next slide So the things that were part of 1, 2, 9, and 10 is that we really have to design mechanisms to ensure that any accessories or devices that aren't correctly implementing or adhering to the protocol will be detected by the protocol and both excluded by the protocol So this would hopefully prevent counterfeit devices from operating on the protocol We also want a tracking accessory to identify and advert has its own presence.

So if you have any documentation, I would love for you to share it because I was on unaware that you were able to opt out of search party D Okay, and then I wanted to just put the scope in this document. So, and I think it's maybe up for up for debate but at least from what I've done in this document, I haven't defined requirements for interactions between accessory manufacturers of law enforcement And then also we're solving the use case for small and not easily discoverable access So these are things like tracking tax like air tags And there's these little cards that Cipelo makes that work on FindMai as well So anything that's like smaller than your phone. All right, next slide. And then I'm going through the definitions. So an accessory I refer to you as ACC this is the device that's being tracked. It's assumed to lack direct internet access and GPS, but it has possesses Bluetooth low energy or BLE capabilities which it uses to send advertisement messages And then, of course, the advertisement is that data that's being beaconed from the accessory over BLE.

Okay So before you get off that slide, though, I think back to then be tracked just by those properties of that device. Okay. So before you get off that slide, I think that's a question about what's a crowdsource network, it's probably something that we should define as well. So you've got a couple thoughts on that Yes, yeah. So a crowdsource network is the crowdsource location tracking network, which means that it's using existing devices in order to determine location So for example, with Airtags an air tag does not have GPS, so the way that you're able to geolocate an Airtag is that it's beckoning information constantly and any nearby iOS devices are able to receive the public key of that air tag which means that the receiver device your phone has its own GPS and so it's going to say to the server, hey, this is the timestamp that I saw this beacon this is my GPS, and then it uploads it to a server So any crowd say to the server, hey, this is the timestamp that I saw this beacon, this is my GPS, and then it uploads it to a server. So any crowdsource network like that is leveraging all of the device in its network to determine location So a crowdsource way of determining location rather than using GPS tied to that specific"

And I see so I see Corbyn's article, so I do want to just clarify for this So this is not saying that I'm opting out of being a finder This is opting out of find my So there's a difference in that because if I want to have air tags, be able to find my phone and be able to leverage, Find My for finding my stuff then I have to have find my on So if I disable the find my network, that means that my device is I'm not my, my Apple ID is no longer participant so I'm no longer able to find any of my stuff, use air tags, use find my phone And what I'm specifically saying is there's no way to turn off your phone as a finder So if I have an iPhone, I'm not able to turn off and say, I don't want my phone to be reporting people's locations So I think that this is something that people should be able to say, like they should be able to say, I don't want my device participating in this Find Mind network If that means that you also can't find your phone, then sure. But I think that turning off all of FindMai is something that you can do but that means that you also can't use air tags so um all right, so to get back to this oh, sorry, still on that slide go back, sorry.

Some crowdsource networks were susceptible to replay attacks Some crowdsource networks were storing identifiable information about tag owners So this identifiable information was, for example, those rotating privacy IDs or storing any locations information in a non-encrypted state. That's a sense where we talked about earlier where the server or the owner of this crowdsource network is able to access information and which is not preserving the privacy of the end users on the network Some networks are also blindly trusting finder reports, meaning that any finder device is just, anybody can just upload reports, even if it's not actually a legitimate finder device Maybe somebody is spoofing a particular mobile device or there's spoofing information about the tracker and so that's important information for us to know because we have to make sure that the crowdsource network is authentic all of these interactions. So next slide And kind of talking about, we'll our ideal properties and features would be this would mean we want to authenticate everything and features would be, this would mean we want to authenticate every step in the process. So we want to make sure that the accessory and the finder have some type of authentication so that the finder is able to verify that this is an authentic accessory and not a counterfeit accessory. And maybe this would mean that there's some type of secret key sharing that occurs so that when the finder receives some type of advertisement, it's able to call back to the crowdsource network server and verify that this is legitimate The crowdsource network should also verify that the finder itself is authentic before"

So we'd want to make sure that tags were registered, but then at the same time, we don't want those tags to necessarily be tied back to specific people so that it's used against them maliciously. Like if a database is compromised So that is something that we'd have to figure out and talk about We also want the crowdsource network to perform authentication to make sure that only valid owners are accessing reports and not just anybody is pulling down these location reports. That's actually been shown by some researchers. Next slide So just continuing on ideal properties and features nobody other than the owner of an accessory would be able to learn anything about the location of a given accessory We want to make sure that it's possible to detect when an accessory is being used to track you. It's also we want to make it not possible for accessories not adhering to the protocol to leverage the protocol for location tracking, and we want to make sure it's not possible for unverified accessories to use the crowd make it not possible for accessories not adhering to the protocol to leverage the protocol for location tracking, and we want to make sure it's not possible for unverified accessories to use the crowdsource network protocol.

Spoofing, we'd like to make it impossible to spoof an accessory We'd like to make it impossible to spoof a location by a finder device um and we want to make it impossible to spoof the crowdsource network so these are again their ideal properties.

So this was from the blind find paper that is referenced And the proprietary 2020 paper, which was the the crowd source, ideal crowdsource network paper that I was the previous slide was from. So we have five stages initial pairing and accessory setup. So the accessory has to be paired with the own device somehow verified as authentic with the crowdsource network the accessory being in nearby owner mode so in this phase the accessory is within Bluetooth range. So in this phase, finder devices should not be generating location reports The accessory shall behave as defined in one of the other documents. So this is, again, making sure that walking around with an air tag or any other type of tracker, like a Samsung Smart tag doesn't allow somebody to stock me by me walking around with my legitimately owned device um okay the comment i don't like tracking at all let's not have air tags. Unfortunately, I think that the business people at Apple will probably disagree with that. So that's not an option. Thanks, thank you I think that the business people at Apple will probably disagree with that, so that's not an option. Thanks, Jonathan. It's our cousin for here through here. Okay, so then the accessory in separated or lost mode is another stage that is being defined if the accessory is not in Bluetooth range of the owner device, the accessory must generate loss messages received by the finder"

And that's that accessory finder communication making sure that that's authentic is it possible to also authenticate the finder to be? and crowdsource network communication and making sure that that's authentic? Maybe we should authenticate both somehow And then finally the owner device would query the crowdsource network for the encrypted location report okay next slide So as part of this setup phase, the accessory and owning device would be paired, establishing some type of shared key that known both the accessory and the owning device The rest of the protocol would proceed as follows so the accessory is periodically sending out some type of advertisement in separate mode where it contains an ephemeral public key, and then also an epic key that's valid for some specified time period The public key and is corresponding private key are generated in a terminate fashion. And this is about the public key and its corresponding private key are generated in a deterministic fashion. And this is so that the owner device can deterministically pull down location reports in a specific time period So in order to report an accessory's location, a finder device will leverage the public key to encrypt it and then it will transmit that to the central service In order to locate an accessory, the owner will generate the private key by using that original shared key Then when it's querying the central service, it has to know some type of secret, so whether that is information derived by"

So there's in the blind my paper we talked about leveraging partial blind signatures to try to authenticate the protocol so basically what this does is the partial blind signatures are a way for a protocol. So basically what this does is the partial blind signatures are a way for us to preserve privacy of the people on the network, but also authenticate the accessories So only authenticated accessories can be on the network So we agree on things like the elliptic curve group message authentication algorithms, hash functions et cetera. Next slide Um, so signature protocol would be a useful property or useful protocol for people to implement. That doesn't mean that this has to be the one that's implemented but this was one that Erick had suggested Well, for others, the reason why you pick it is because it's already been vetted and published in an rc so we have a stable reference. There's less argument. I believe this got vetted by the CFRG so it makes things a little easier. If we want to invent our own, we got to redo that whole loop, and it's hard and Rekker and maybe you can, like, figure out some cryptography, but I don't want to be the one doing that Exactly.

And luckily we got one of those guys in line so. Awesome I, yeah, okay be that, I'll wear that hat Chris Patton, Cloudflare, I'm, I just wanted to point out that I think the blind rs a has an rc but i think that partially blind RSA is a different protocol and it's not, it's still going through CFRG.

And even, I mean, the like the nuance between like blind and partially blind is, like, we don't have to, it doesn't have to be partially blind, but that was an element that was part of it preserving privacy. So that's something that we could, like, we could hash out later next slide Hold on, Nick Okay yeah i was curious about the um Seeker Key and I'll read more, but if you can quickly help me think through the threats if there's a shared secret key on the accessory, does an attacker who gains physical control of the accessory have the ability to extract the secret key and then generate all of the past keys and query all of the past? locations of the accessory?

So yeah, not so storing all of the keys on the devices something that's important. So once they generate, they use like this Katie and once they start the generation process they don't actually like need to keep storing that shared key I don't think. Talking about past locations is actually really important, which is why we tried to talk about like having some type of time time-bound parameter within the scheme. And that was because the time-bound parameter will mean that the crowdsource network is not indefinitely storing locations We should probably suggest some type of time-bound state, so either seven days or 24 hours or something like that for which a location report is stored on a network. And similarly, what we tried to suggest is that if somebody pulls an old key, they shouldn't be able to pull down a location report from a period that's not valid. So by tying the time period mechanism to the signature you're able to prevent people from forging signatures because they have to both know the valid time period of that key and then"

So that's just like another thing that may or may not be possible depending on what the device is like Apple has the secure enclave, which has the UUID burned into the chipset, but for TAG is. Like Apple has the secure enclave, which has the UUID burned into the chipset, but for tags like air tags, I don't think there's, they're not complex enough to have like some type of firmware um thing like built in so it really just depends and that's things that we definitely need to hash out and and is the the idea that those mitigations either what Apple is doing or some signature? protection, would be defined in this protocol? Yeah. Okay Thanks. Of course, yeah So next slide, I'm going to, I think going a little over time, so I want to just kind of speed through this So this is...

However, we would also want to make sure that even though a device being registered, with the network, the network is under understanding, yes, this is a legitimate registered device. We also don't want the network to store any private information besides that a device with this zero number was registered in that zero number is now in use, but we would want to make sure that it's not causing the end user to have private information about themselves to explode in some way Next slide So this gets into the key generation and signing with partially blind signatures So the accessory must periodically be provisioned with temporal keys that the finder devices can use to encrypt its location reports. So this would mean that there's some type of public key that's beaconed out from the device and a timestamp value associated with that public key. And then the finder device is able to encrypt its location reports and upload it to the crowdsource network The implementation in the blind my page suggested pre-generating the keys"

So even if somebody was sniffing the key, they wouldn't know the signed version of that key, so they wouldn't be able to use it So this gets into the implementation details where as this is suggested in blind signatures, the way you generate a blinded key is you have some type of private key public key, and then the info field which is just some type of auxiliary information which they recommend, could be time-based information and then that generates a blinded key And so specifically having a blinded key prevents the crowdsource network or the central server from tracking those keys Next slide And so another piece of that authentication would be that the crowdsource network is ensuring the acceptability of the time timestamp. So this means that that auxiliary in information is trying to keep the signing or the requests within a specific window so we wouldn't want somebody to be able to generate future keys either or to forge signing replies Um, I forget what I want to say on the rest of this slide"

So I think that could be an interesting way to not fully exposed some of the information about these signatures, but also make sure that we authenticated at every point in the process Eric also suggested using the HPK-E seal and using that to encrypt, so that's just another encrypted protocol something that a cryptography would need to help us with is should we be working with hashes or should you be sending out these public keys What can we send out? in the clear because these things are beckoned over? a channel that can be sniffed so what can we beacon out from the actual devices? What can be uploaded? to the network? And what preserves privacy? so yeah these are like all very open questions"

So instead of leaving it on the owner device to make sure that they're pulling down these authentic reports, we really shouldn't allow the crowdsource network to store invalid reports either Next slide So yeah, this kind of a big ask. So I'm a reverse engineer not a protocol architect. I reverse engineer most of the find my protocol and they're anti-tracking framework, and I reverse engineer and jailbreak devices all the time, but I'm not a cryptographer.

It talks about when you need to average a Bluetooth advertisement that can be used for detected detecting unwanted tracking the next major subsection is the actual payload of that advertisement. There was a lot of thought put into this So the payload contains a header that is very well defined that allows different platforms whether it's iOS or Android or other operating systems to reliably and easily detect that an accessory is potentially being used for unwanted tracking. And then it also allows for a payload that is proprietary to the individual company or the finding networks that they may put in the one to put in their own stuff i know this is up for the this is hot debated in the boff meetings and the previous working group so I suspect that parts of this will continue to evolve"

The next subsections on service data at TLV and the network ID, the service data TLV section defines a it's called a UID, but it's a, very short identifier that goes into the Bluetooth head that was purchased from the Bluetooth sig so that any platform can recognize that this advertisement is for unwanted tracking detection. And then the network idea is just an allowance for different finding networks to exist and have a unique identifier for them The next few subsections are on a near under bit advertising interval and connections nearerbit is exactly what it's sounds like. It's a bit that indicates if the accessories with its owner or not. The advertising interval is an allowable section talks about a allowable range of advertising rates for Bluetooth advertisements It can't be too long or things like connecting to the accessory or detecting it reliably don't work well And then finally there's some information on Bluetooth connections There's a defined GATs characteristic in GAS service UIDs which are needed to connect to the accessory And then the next subsection is on the proprietary company payload, We talk about some of the privacy requirements that that needs to uphold. Then the payload. We talk about some of the privacy requirements that that needs to uphold. Then there's the accessory information section, which is a very big section on opcodes. So all the commands and responses that can do things like play sound serial number or identifier number lookup creating off other information for the accessory like it make and model hopefully that can all be reused There's a lot of thought that went into that part and then the other relevant subsections are disablement identification you have to have a way to disable an accessory if you find it to protect yourself"

And then the owner registry is something that talk that is set up at pairing time to allow the association of the that information that serial number or identifier and the owner information And then the, yeah, sorry And then the last four sections are pretty brief the accessory category information section is really just a table of the category values for different types of accessories, we allow a backpack, a bicycle, and a tracker all they have unique identifiers, a small enumerated type And then the firmware update, platform support section, and the onboarding sections are basically just placeholders for new text Great So quick walkthrough of the outline That's all I had. I have a set of questions. I'm hoping the audience has a set of questions And I'm going to get a drink of water OK, all right Great All right, Christine, excuse me, Christine Fireway Yeah, I just had a question about I was looking at the product and I, at first I thought that it was deviating from, like the, advertising requirements defined by SIG because it was it seemed like it was removed the FF tag which comes right before manufactured specific data but then Alex explained I guess you guys are implementing a new BLE service rather than sending a BLE advertisement. So can you explain the this change?"

I think the question was there's discussion around advertisements and also services or connections and what's maybe what's different there? and how does it interplay with backward compatibility? yeah yeah so the advertisement right is what these accessories are doing all the time to say here i am whether it's for crowdsource finding or anyone to tracking detection that I'll get to the backward compatibility part in the section, second That's absolutely needed. The connection though are also needed so for example if you detect that an accessory is traveling with you and you show it a alert and you want to tap the play sound button, that requires obviously a connection to send it off code to the accessory to have it play sound and what I mentioned that's in the document is there's and these are also registered by the Bluetooth via the Bluetooth sig is a UID for the GAT characteristic and the GAT service that allow you to ask the accessory hey, do you support these particular services if the accessory says, yes, I support those, then you can send out codes that are valid on those services Do that answer your question? Oh, okay. So this service is being introduced in addition to the existing advertisement framework Is that? Yeah, the way my understanding of the way Bluetooth Gat works is that you have to have a service UID and a characteristic UID ID in order to ask the ex accessory, are you capable of supporting this class of things You use those identifiers to request that and if the accessory responds affirmatively, then you know that, hey, I could send a set of op codes associated with those services and characteristics to tell it to do so certain things. Okay. Gotcha So the advertisements aren't going away"

Thanks All right, cool. Now we got Nick We got plenty of time. We got 35 minutes folks. Cool This comment is about the same question. They should go ahead because I have a totally separate question I'm sorry, Nick I didn't catch that. Go to the next person? Okay. Maggie Hi, yeah, so this is something that I wanted to bring up, but I kind of wanted to wait until everyone had presented because I'm not sure where this should go yet But one of the big things that we've talked about in our document and a little bit in some of the other documents is this idea of having support for active scanning, and it seems like, that needs to involve a platform in some way So I guess one of my first questions was, can people where did we come down on the topic of? what we're going to require or suggest? of platforms? Because I saw that you have a section, Brent, in, like a to-do section about like platform so like maybe if we had some guidance of about active scanning capabilities of platforms, it would go in document three, but maybe it would go in the new document two that we haven't written yet. Yeah, you think, too? Yeah, my thinking is the way we do decomposed this last time was the unwanted tracking detection algorithm document number two is all about the you know what are the heuristics or policies used to detect that a air tag or other access is traveling with you that you don't recognize and when to you know tell the user about that I given that say an example of using passive scale as you've defined it, I think you could consider expanding this scope of document two to include active scanning"

    "startTime": "01:28:00",
    "text": "Okay, yeah. And so then there's some like there are certain things that are in this protocol right now that are hard-coded in that maybe would change based on the algorithm in that the passive track algorithm in document two, right? Like the 30, like it has to be disconnected for 30 minutes or these kinds of things, right? so we just need to make sure that those are synced up i think I think that that was it. I have some other minor things, but we can just talk about those online Nick? Yeah I guess I was curious if you could, like I know the section hasn't been written yet, but what do you intend for this? section on platform support? Good question. So, um the one of the, if you read the previous internet, draft, that was the one that Apple and Google, you know, provided ship support for, there's a little bit of this discussion in there about what's needed One of the things that is described in that document is if I don't ever want to see on unwanted tracking alerts for my own accessories And we have this concept of a neuron owner bit to say, hey, this accessory is with its owner, therefore don't show it alert, even if it's traveling with you. But there's discussion in that other document about kind of a belt and side suspenders approach, where my devices know the public key that should be advertised by my accessories therefore even if an accessory that I own is traveling with me, somehow it's newer and a bit is set to false that I still have a way of preventing showing unwanted tracking alerts because I know the set of keys that should be advertising There are some challenges when you expand that out to all potential parties that want to participate on the different platforms out there, whether it's Android"

I don't know if it has to stand in the final version so it sounds like maybe that's um leaving this in as, hey, we should think about this. I don't know if it has to stay in the final version. So it sounds like maybe that's, we would want to generate requirements from non-operating system vendors who are operating, who are producing track or, or crap crowdsource networks to see what needs they have to, uh, operate these protections? So is that what would be? in that section? I think so, yeah Okay, as opposed to, like, one thing we've also got discussed here although I'm not sure we've decided if it's in scope is like how should we should there be required? on operating systems? about how they handle alerts for? how they describe alerts to users? about potential unwanted tracking? That's a good question I'm trying to remember in the charter if we talked about that that If it's within scope of the charter, my recommendation would probably be document number two, but I don't recall if it's in the charter or not Anyone else know the charter? at the top of their head? I don't see it we addressed it in the chart but Erica did bring it up so i do think it's is something important to address um"

So I do think it is something important to address and maybe it would need its own document But yeah, I do think that that is something that we should definitely whoever taking minutes if you could write this down as something that we should address I have a general question then. When we come up with topics that are not in the charter, but we're interested in? what's the best way to manage that? Well usually you just stick in a document you've already adopted, to be honest. There's something that's did I did I say that out loud If it's a big enough topic and it needs its own document, you can update the you can update the charter. We can always add a new document It's not hard. It just takes a little bit of machinery to get the IESG and our AD to agree. She's new so she wants to learn how to press all these buttons. So we can know hard. It just takes a little bit of machinery to get the IESG and our AD to agree. And she's new, so she wants to learn how to press all these buttons. So we can, if we find things that we think that need to be added, we can definitely do Fair enough Not the close button, not the close button. Okay Hi, Jonathan hui, jonathan hoyland, Cloudflare Could you say a little bit more about what you think? what we're thinking about active scanning? Because, I mean, I think it would be hilarious I could walk down the train and make everyone go beep if they have an air tag Yeah, I, so this document number three, I don't think needs to cover active scanning. I mean, maybe there's a part that needs to go in but I think if you're advertising so what's in the document today? in advertisements, it's an unwanted tracker you can create a connection to pull off things like the make and model I think that's the bits and pieces you need that if you wanted to implement active scanning on a host platform that you would be able to present all the right information But I wasn't intending to talk about what an operating system would need to do or policies around active scanning in this document given its more the protocol between the access"

I guess my question is more about what is active scanning intended to mean, whether it's in this document or not? Maggie, do you want to take that? one? That was your, you defined it and talked about it earlier. I think I don't know. Yeah, so let's see, what did we call it earlier? We said a search for location trackers manually initiated by a user so I do think we need to define it in more detail somewhere But the intent behavior is that I could, you know, have an app on my phone that makes anyone with an air tag name you go beep Well, so we have to decide what the what you would do if you did detect something and also what kinds of circumstances under which you would like a thing would be detected so okay so let me explain like the reason why you would want this. So the reason why you might want something like this is because, um, especially the way a lot of things are, things are developed right now is if you're relying on passive notifications, then you want to scan your environment to make sure that there's nothing around you before you go do something of high risk, for example, or you're trying to leave And so we want to have some way for people to be able to scan for the things, right? But, I mean, maybe you're at what you're suggesting is that there could be a way to abuse that, right? So we need to find a way to allow people to actually be able to scan their environment, like in a domestic violence situation And then maybe we also have to think about ways to not allow you know, someone to get on the subway and beep everyone. So I think that's something that we have to figure out but I think I feel pretty sure strongly that we need to have some ability for people to do that under certain circumstances. Yeah, I mean if I could just make this real, looks like Greg said, that the normal protection from the beep attack is that trackers won't do it if they're approximately of the owner, and that's correct So in the current implementation of a quote active scanning tool, there's an app called AirGuard that you can download"

    "text": "that was developed by t darmstadt and you click manual scan on your device and it will look for any device that is beaking in VLE, whether it's an air tag smart tracker from Samsung or a tile. But if you attempt to send the request to make it beep, and it's something that's paired with the owner, then it will not beep so with an example, if I'm trying to stalk you and I put an air tag in your backpack and I walk away, I'm out of BLE distance, if you click manual scan, it gets to detected, you can send a request to make it beep and it will beep. But if I'm within BLE distance, of you, like I'm stalking you and I'm in the conference room, then you try to make the air tag beep and you cannot make it beep at this time. So yeah, I think this is a interesting use case that we should definitely look into Very interesting. Thank you Christine, you're back in the queue Sorry, that was, I was just trying to kind of put it in real terms I think it's helpful when we use real examples Okay, so we're at the same point now, unless you have questions too All right, cool. All right, cool. Let me go back to the questions. A few other for the audience just to get feedback So one of the ones was, and this was discussed, I think, in Prague and maybe last session two, you know, should we, in the specific question I have is should we reuse the blue Bluetooth advertisement header that was published in the previous Internet draft and the one that's in Dr document number three right now. The value of reusing not only that that specific format for the header and the UID is we would have backwards compatibility to any except we could have backwards compatibility to any accessories that are supported that previous protocol protocol Anyone have thoughts?"

    "startTime": "01:38:00",
    "text": "on that? And I realize not everyone's read the documents so it may be hard too to the document, so it may be hard, too. To be honest, like, as much as I like backwards compatibility, I also wouldn't want a bad actor to like have a really old air tag that for some reason is not able to be detected or some really old device So I think we do have to think about if something if we're not going to force old devices to either update to some new protocol because it's not possible for them to have some type of firmware update that has it follow the new protocol, we need to like really think long and hard and consider like is there a way that the back? compatibility will be abused because somebody has some some old version that is like not trackable in some way? So that's just my two sense on that. Yeah, that's a good point We did add versioning into that the software we released, the protocol that we released to anticipate at least that aspect of it you're right that there are some accessors that will probably never be able to update to the newest stuff I mean, from a protocol design perspective, Greenfield is always better So we can always take this to the list, too A couple more questions. Yeah, go ahead set of opcodes that are defined in the document for things like play sound serial number lookup, pulling off the make and model again, same type of question. Should we reuse those op codes? These may end up being rhetorical questions at this point So again, from a design perspective, right, if there's no reason to change it, I'd just leave them the same, right? design perspective, right? If there's no reason to change it, I'd just leave them the same. There's no, I don't know if there's a scarcity of space or whatever, but yeah Op codes are pretty cheap when it comes to"

Um, honestly like my, my only issue with the protocol as it stands right now is the fact that um the differentiation between like nearby and separated is really just that one bit and that one bit is what an enables with the current implementation and the current implementation doesn't have authentic of those accessories So somebody could have a tag that is always quote, in nearby mode. And then it's not triggering the anti-tracking framework framework So yeah, that's my issue with that specific option code, but I think if we authenticated the accessories, then maybe that wouldn't be an issue So some of these specific accessory, like, bits or bytes, really kind of depend on like the aggregate look at like how are we leveraging crowdsource network protocol. What are the protections that we're putting in between accessories and find devices and owner devices and not necessarily not saying that those other things don't matter, but like it wouldn't matter as much that this one bit is like a huge issue right now Yeah, that's good feedback Thank you. Yes Hi, bob hinden. So just to the previous topic about older devices at least if I think I comment on what I think I heard said. I mean, this is the IETF. We're not the protocol police. We don't regulate what people deploy we make voluntary protocol standards So there is no ability here"

So I hope that that is clear Johnnheim hoyland Claudebler, just to respond directly to that given that there is a centrally controlled operating network track a network, if Apple decides, oh, some old tag is now bad and broken they can just be like, bye But they can just stop it working if they choose to Certainly Apple could do that, but the IETF can't make them do that Oh, sure. So that's the same This is a protocol, voluntary process standards. We can't tell companies force companies to do anything like that It's not something that's impossible that it could happen right? It's not something like, oh, we can't get rid of all these old devices because it's technically impossible There is a central single body that could do it more Yeah, go ahead there isn't because apples find my network network the only network out there, for example tile runs, it's over"

Yeah, so next one is more about the structure of document number three So Bluetooth LE is a primary component of crowdsourcing networks today, the way I wrote this, it's kind of interwoven into the document We could, though, instead anticipate future technology and make this document more transport agnostic I don't know what the next transport would be, but that is one way to consider re- restructuring this. If you've got any thoughts on that part. I do know at the last meeting somebody did ask what was the next protocol we said we did this one first the next so it's not a bad thing to be thinking about because I don't know what it is, but it's something that may be coming down the pipe the question about like a non-blututh future? yeah so so what else is out there? There's Bluetooth long range is another protocol, which is maybe a little bit different You know, there's other companies that have released tried to release like pet tracking network on like 900 megahertz or other like cellular signals. So ad hoc networks. So just trying to think, like, people have tried to do it. I imagine Bluetooth won't be the only primary crowdsourcing network transport for the next end years so should we kind of reorganize a document to be a little bit more transported? agnostic? Are there any constraints imposed by Bluetooth, I guess that matter? for, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I mean, the payload side is a big one. You have 30 bytes total, including the Mac address, so you don't have a lot to work with um but like all transports have constraints right yeah"

Yes, there might be constraints that are driven by Bluetooth and they think to be in there, and you can call them out, but have the transport section be separate and plugable so that some could plug in another transport. We've done that in many protocols and it works pretty well. Yeah, it seems feels like the right thing to me. Appreciate that Dr. Covenant, so one of the other things that I think will be coming at some point is the ultride band you know 154 type of things because now the phones are already using that to do actually the ranging and there is an I believe working group or touch group 15 AB that is actually working to enhance that ranging and there's lots of things that they are actually now do 154 a b that is actually working to enhance that ranging and there's lots of things that they are actually now doing they are moving all they did use to set up the ranging in Bluetooth and then you still provide band all to the ranging now they are moving these you know, set up from Bluetooth to ultra wide band narrow band you know fine in there so they don't have to have a Bluetooth, which means that if they don't going to, are not going to be having Bluetooth, they probably aren't going to be you know doing this advertisement or other things also over the ultra wide band so they can actually reuse the battery life or what. So that's actually something that they, I don't think the current draft, has anything about that yet, but I think there are they are moving on that direction yeah yeah and i'm familiar with some of that movement so thanks for the comment So the only thing I would like to note, Nick's comment, because I kind of tend to agree, because I'm about trying to get documented adopted. I wouldn't try to do the reorganization until after it got it in the working group. I don't want to wait for you to do the editorial stuff.
