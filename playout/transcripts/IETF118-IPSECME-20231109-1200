So I'd have no idea brokerments are talking without, you know, going and finding all the RFP numbers. So we had one document in RFP editor queue, at Ike there we have a one that is in publication requested out, announced. We we still have the I GI version 2 waiting. For a couple of people to review it and comment it. It has been waiting only. I I think that's more than 10 years. And then we have one document in working group last call, and if we haven't received signal comment on that. So it doesn't look very good for people to actually working on that. If they're done really then review it. It's probably not going to be go forward. Multi essay performance. And then if you have a debugging in process, this is the SATS payloads.

He's in pitchy open pitch doing, you know, because they are doing re chartering, So I will actually talk with him afterwards.

I think the first one is Paul. You want to your slides to yourself, or do you do I just say next time? Okay. No. No. You you you do it.

And if you then have a configuration where you have a different value for your ESP Diffee Almond group versus your, like, Difee Almond group. Then you get, like, quite some inconsistent behavior depending on how you enforce how an implementation enforces these different settings. Because in a way, you can actually make a configuration that is impossible to comply with. But but but but these configurations are being allowed by implementations and then end up being on the wire. So one core problem is that Also, after you, establish that initial icon and child essay, you don't actually know if the other ant will want to do PFS on on the Ricky. That there's no trace in in the initial negotiation of doing that. So you don't actually know when when 2 humans are are configuring this connection, Once it's up, they just assume it will work, but then at Wiki, it could break because, like, one insists on on difficult, on, perfect for efficacy in the other and refuse it. So, next slide. Thank you. So if they negotiate IDH is not valid, for a child age, then they'll respond as a few options. Like, if the if there's no PFS and there's no because there is actually no no DH used. If there is PFS, then, I guess you have to you can return no proposal chosen. Which is slightly better than invalid KE because invalid KE is really meant to signal wanna use it different different different different Diffee Helmet group off the list you received that are valid. And then, if you do PFS as yes, then you you kinda that the peer has the same child, the, the age value. And then on the initiator, you've got similar similar issues where you, you you could decide if you've if your eye is configured with, let's say, diffy Helmet 2 and your ESP is configured for Diffy Helmet 14.

And then we don't only have to so so the the the issue starts at the initial change, but actually, it sort of not really happens at the child. And there's also issues if you have multiple child essays and one comes in with the icon saying you add second one later on in in in your configuration. That is the the same development groups. So anyway, so so You you, it it shows a a few options that you can do. One suggestion is that we have a, like, a new payload that would sort of stay like unexpected DHke or something else to to to sort of more, or show this error code. But to to show you a bit of the problem, next slide, oh, sorry. These are the so apart from the problem I I explained, there's additional complications. One is that, at least all the versions of Microsoft put, Probably do something like diffiehellman14 for I guess and then a lower Diffie Helmet value. And I think it was actually DH2 or DH5. For the child. And then so you actually had this at rekey. You do it, like, you know, do weird things with the David Helmet group. So so we actually, as an implement, where we added an option to sort of accept that because we couldn't reach people inside Microsoft. Additionally, this problem also comes up again in the the draft as NCS payloads. Where we're doing, like, this this, rekey with this exactly the same parameter. So we PFS, we only send a new KE group and nothing else. But again, that that also has the same problem of not knowing this information because didn't become obvious from the initial, exchanges. Additionally, there's a problem of, some implementations, in, want to see the DH non value in the transforms."

Oh, sorry. All the all the configured groups instead of continue with the initiated group. So you could actually switch the ESP value midway through because of this. Fixed that and then we ran into other issues. So is a metrics of all the options, where we needed to to to figure out what to do and how to behavior change. The number really looks like this is a much bigger issue. We should just clarify this in the in the document somewhere. So next slide. So, one option is to disallow having a different different different development group for the eye kinda child assays because, like, an IP tutor really is not a clear distinction anymore. For people who've been here for a while, you might vaguely remember that already tried to do that in Rfc 8247, and people didn't like that. So assuming that's still the case. Are some other solutions out there, but really what it comes down to is that I think the best solution we've sort of come up with in the in the hallways. Is that, if you just add the Diffree Helmet group of the seen you negotiated to the child essay proposals. Then at least on the on the on the wiki, ensure that you at least have know, a possibility of negotiating the same group. You might negotiate like a stronger group. But at least you got you don't have a degrade in security because you already used this group for the the child to say that's gonna be I can say. So you already have you know, a potentially weaker group. So you might you might have, like, not gotten what you wanted because of your configuration, but then that"

It seems like the origin of this problem is that the initial exchange succeeded Correct. And and that if it would consistently fail, then people would go, oh, I misconfigured. Correct. And would would pick a configuration 1 or the other. So it seems like something that goes to that direction without breaking everything. Would be the best direction to go be most consistent Right. So so that's But I don't know what of the choices you given is the the best for instance, the the first option where you just advertise way to get there. So the the the family group that you will use later on during your Wiki with the use goal, but of course, that requires everybody updates before they support doesn't remove Because you can't just ignore that. It would be no no proposal chosen. If you ignore it in the future, you will get no proposals to it. But then you have all the decisions to immediately fill your connection when you start up.

You know, still doing sole behavior. it doesn't help you for all these existing things out you want to if it's gonna break, you wanna you wanna do something that breaks it immediately. For new implementations break immediately and and then they recognize that there's a configuration error. Right. And then for the old implementations, if we allow the KE group of the I guess safe also for the ESP, the phenomena group, then, you know, you've already negotiated under that group. So you're already running with that protection So, like, on the rekey, it's kind of keeping the same protection. Even if your configuration wasn't meant to use one, but you already committed to to breaking your own configuration when you negotiated the for that child. So it so it sounds like we should do both those things. Okay. Great. That'll keep it as an individual. So I think that proper solution is to say that your ESP. If you think about it, Iike, the Difei Hellman in Ike, That's usually the most important one. Because you are you are you are quite often child essays. You know, the PFS in child is is can can you see, you know, lower because it's usually shorter time period. You might be reeking every hour, and you don't need to do, you know, eight kilobit, you know, group for protecting that. You can use a shorter one But so so so I think we should be thinking about that that allowing the same group that you do in Ike, is probably stronger than in a PFS. I I don't see really reason why you, but PFS group would be a stronger So so allowing the same group always to be used in fee and Aic. For for, you know, ESP would always allow the same group that they like would be the easy solution because that would actually solve the problem for old embedded So, to reinforce the configuration, if the configuration doesn't allow if you're ESP says Crew 5."

You're gonna always use this, you know, trial based negotiation with you do the ICSA without the child. Yes. So And and and then you create a create child essay as a separate.

Because for additional child, let's say, you can very often not to AFS, consider sedation when you create I can say, and then you need to create I think dozens of additional trying to save for some because of some policy. There's no point to use PayFac in this case, cause, the initial entropy that you get from ICSA is efficient, very short time best since you created, I could say, but when you do your key, of any say, it's always for Chelsea.

That might not fit to all use cases today anymore, and that's what I'm going to talk today. Next slide. Okay. Next. Yeah. What are the problematic scenarios? One thing is high speed networks. Here's a problem that and a trailer may end up in different cash lines, what could cause performance penalties. If your link speed is very high, And the other thing is our 4 byte alignment for the ESP payload display too short for modern instructions. The next thing is software defined networking. They want to see in a transport header to handle that. But they're, of course, encrypted and, well, if it cannot be seen So next slide. So one of the possible solutions.

Of course, our main pack processing would benefit from cash locality and the parsing would be much simple because you don't have to study of the payload in between And so you exactly know where your header and trailer fields are disadvantages, of course, that is a larger change in the packed layout. That have to do them. Okay. Next. So the other thing is the alignment requirements. So advantage is would be of course that, modern instruction to operate much faster But there's a bunch of just if you align, the payload, the trailers, the trailer still might not be aligned. Because you have this, payload in between, which you don't need to know the pack the size of So the package would require even more padding to align the trailer to So we think that might be useful if the trailer is going to be removed but otherwise would not consider this other change. Next, So what about SDN? So in SDN, they want to see the inner transport header, and I think there are 2 abilities. First one is to use an encryption offset saying just let's show ended at the beginning of the inner header that's, the transport header can be parsed or you just swap ESP and transport header. I don't think it's any other option possible. So next slide. So what about the encryption of such advantages as that is easy would enable the use cases and It is optional. You can just leave it 0, and this means it's encrypting everything. It's up to you to choose how many bytes you want to show inside the packet. This advantage here is, of course,"

That would be transparent for intermediate devices, but it would look a bit strange and it's probably a violation so we would not recognize even though it's tactical possible. That slide. So which were the social problems? So first thing is you could adjust the ESP protocol. Could define a new protocol that's always possible. Or we might be able to reuse the West protocol to get what we want. We haven't considered that in the draft, but I'm just showing it for complete this year. So next slide. So what about adjusting the ESP protocol? That would work pretty well for SQL summer problems. Because you just interpret some header fields differently. There's no change to header and trailer, and that would works works, works, works, works, quite well for that case. But problematic would be, if you want change header and trailer format because you don't have new vertical number. So you need to negotiate all these numerations somehow. And it's not transparent to middle boxes. So it would not enable the SCN case. Next. So defining new protocol, what probably solve all of the problems maybe we could use school PSP as a starting point and look how it goes. Which is, of course, the most invasive change, but on the other hand, it's also sort of most flexible change. So, if you want to have a modern encryption product that meets all the use cases in today's network. I've probably way to go. Next, Okay.

That's what I have. Wanna take a question, suggestions, and ask for adoption. Thank you Paul. So so I'll start. So, It's been a long time since I skimmed the Google PSV document. So Can you tell me maybe 1 or 2 lines? What is the difference between The suggested ESP changes by moving the trailer into the header, and the variable length offset. And PSP. The PSP protocol keeps the trailer, but he the protocol has has an offset for a encryption, and it moves, the next header field out of the trailer into the header. And it has a virtual network that identify a field as optional, It's just a starting point. You can look at this. Mean, the Google people are interested to come to the ITS and discuss about that. They're open to changes to that protocol. So it might be a starting point, and we kind of a look and adjust it to our needs to getting the standard. Thank you very much. So I think, actually, rapid ESP was actually meant to be used for this kind of purposes. And, you know, modifying it to actually spend, for a while, we could we could make it so that we could We could modify it so that we actually take some of the pieces from inner header, transport header, move it out to the Rapid ESP Henner.

But we are talking about high speed links where probably, you know, kind of copying. Would it have that valid that much? And also, you could have probably solved some of the alignment problems also by, you know, just adding amount of padding to make sure that the ESP header, you know, padding is is correct for the very life. One of the problem with the padding thing is the padding changes every single generation of the CPU. So so so today, we need 32 bytes or or 64 byte current. Next next next week, me, Mike, me me me, me, me, 156 bytes, you know, alignment. So trying to you know, optimize it for certain, you know, use cases, is not really that useful. And, also moving stuff to the end also has a property that you can't actually do some of the parsing in the, in the line speed, it's really there's there's I know that there's have been at least actually implementations who actually start processing bucket before it actually finishes coming from the link. So when they see the SPI, they might actually start I'll routing it before actually got caught to the end the pocket. And if you have a jumbo cramp that this will be really big, that vaccine might be a big difference. Mean, we we had test, we tried that to move the header to the trailer, and we could see that we get performance improvements with that. Regarding West. Yeah. I mentioned this because I noticed We don't need to change ESP for that, but I wasn't sure if the record group would like to appuse misuse change. That protocol for that purpose. I I don't think it's a a misuse. I think it's it's used for us intended it's first intended to be extensions that are"

Which is the, and, yeah, an encrypted beginning of the packet. So just as a way to do, but that's it might be an on a a horrible hack. Then Sorry? That's what rapid ESP does. Partly. Yeah. Possibly. That's it. Michael of the school ending there that that's what the rapid ESP does. It's basically actually header there in the beginning of the before the ESP header. It's part of the ESP still actually, but but has a separate protocol number but then it would be outside the ISP. Yes. But the other question is, whether we should act, w, yes, or not, I think it's probably better because at the time we published a WESP. We really promised that the very last could point where you're gonna ask, yeah, I would promise. So maybe that would save a lot of time just for using that, product Honest, listening to the discussion, I'm wondering whether your question that you originally asking your presentation people are already beyond that and and ready debate deep into, like, how could we solve it?

I don't know if you wrote it down in the document on on how much benefits or how much performance improvements you will actually get out of this. I would be curious, interested in I I don't think the instruction lens will change, like, every few months. I wouldn't go that far. You know, stuff lives longer than we would think.

And this is the the updates for the 3rd iteration of the entire replace of space is draft. So first, next slide, please. Quick recap if some of you have in, within the draft yet. You've seen there is a lot of activity in the working group around the, issues with anti replay. Mostly interesting scenarios, multicore, when you need multiple course to use the MSA, there should be a child And in the case of multi pass, because, packet reordering causes and replace issues. This has been very well documented in the in the multi sequence counter is draft and presented by Stephen, last ATF So, have a look at the recording if you need more information about what's going on. And there has been solutions as well discussed, like the multi essay performance, which basically suggests to have multiple essays negotiate multipleences and these draft proposals. Fairly decent solution to that. You know, no nothing against it. But the problem and the reason why we are publishing this other draft is because this first solution doesn't our context. Because it would end up,"

I'll get more into numbers in a later slide, but for now, just bear in mind that this will increase the number of keys that we have to do, to support this would increase a lot to the number of that we have to send. And, you know, pointing out as well that IP2 was originally designed to reduce the number of messages because of the traffic selector issues. Also the more Charlie says you have, the more PFS becomes costly. Whenever it's enabled. So, our solution is in a very brief summary. We are suggesting to, make the 64 bits anti plastic visits in the USB header. Instead of just search 2 bits and use, just a few bits of them, the first, the header bits as a subspace ID. This way we We keep the sequence number uniques, they they they remain unique, but we have multiple counters so that we can use different c, anti replic counters for different course, for different paths. And this, shows some really strong benefit for us in our case. We have, a single essay we have a single entity to establish this, child you say. And we have a a lot of clarity around, okay, is the subspace negotiation successful or not, and we don't end up with having you know, a lot of messages, to exchange also, to us, it feels like a better approach to solving the problem because we believe this is an entire equation because at Herrick, it was not designed with that in mind. And we are trying to fix that at the level of entry play and not by modifying Ike, which is another another layer. Also, you know, we don't since we are not modifying Ike too much, it makes I think the implementation somewhat easier. So it does require a change to ESP. But, this the change seems a little bit cleaner."

    "text": "So getting to that in the height changes in the next slide, so the only that that's most of the changes since last draft, we added a new transform. So the SNS in short for sequence numbers of spaces, SMS transform, just like, encryption or ESN, it's, it's another parameter that you to modify the way you do the cryptos. In that case, you creates a variance around the entire replay. That transform contains 2 values, the first one, the supported inbound subspaces, is gonna tell how many inbound surface fees we are able to to receive. And support. And the second value is how many outbound subspace we want to use. Because from our experience, that's how we want to use the subspaces. It's the sender that knows how many subspaces it wants to use because it knows how many cores it how many, how many paths, different uplinks, and pass it as, so it knows how many subspaces it needs to use, and it's up to the receiver to say, okay. I do supports that many subspaces for you, or I don't. And with just one RT, we are able to to exchange, and negotiate how many subspaces we want to use. Next slide, please. So the implementation status, again, we have implemented that in PPP. We are student meeting and we want to open sourcing, open source the the changes we've made. But we still need to clean that up, before we can do so. Same thing more or less for strong swan, but that is new. So we have made the changes to to strong swan, and this is what it looks like in the end. In the same way you specify your ESP proposals, it's a it's a change to the crypto, the way you do crypto. So it's a change to the proposal. And you added the transform as an SMS transform. Specifying the 2 values again, the number of inbound spaces that you support and the number of outbound faces that you would do once."

I've mentioning that for 2 reasons. 1st, just mentioning that we are wanting to deploy that next year, it doesn't mean that we don't want to interpret with others. It doesn't mean that we don't, I mean, we are really we really do want this to become a stand out, you know, it doesn't mean that we are not willing to make changes to that. It's not because we deploy it that we cannot match make changes for the for the standard. And I just wanted to clarify that. And also, you know, I wanted to explain how we do use it and why we end up with so many subspaces. It's mostly happening on TX when we want to transmit an APS packet. Every core ends up needing to send, packets on a given essay. And let's say we have 8 calls, for instance. Then the call was split on a given up ink. We might have, like, 3 airplanes. So every core, every airplane needs a different, every combination of those 2 need in the different, subspace or child essay, if you do it with a different child essays. But as well, you should sent to a remote sphere which has multiple uplinks and your an SD WAN router just like we are. And, you know, you monitor the different paths you have, you're trying to take the best out of them. You try to use the best path. So you end up using multiple paths. And so you end up, let's say, 3 airplanes, local uplink, 3 remote uplink. 9 different paths, and let's say you have a different course that's 72, different subspaces that you need. And at this point, I I I hope that you understand our pain when we realize that we would need 144 IP messages just to negotiate that many child essays. And that's why we're continuing to present this draft is because for us, this seems very kind of go. On the inbound, when we receive the packet, it's actually pretty simple. We just, load balance the the packets, using the the subspace to the different call"

So currently, the draft has to disclose IPRs with, you know, what I call good terms, you know, the the free of use, if becomes a standoff. And during the tune of state ships, there has been, what I call, rumors of another patent. We have trying we have been trying to find it. We have not found it. You know, and I'm saying that on record. We have not found this pattern. And no one was able to actually point us us, towards a given, that patent. So, you know, just wanted to point out that either you know this patent exists and you are able to provide it, you show it, or, you know, just don't talk about rumors is Second point was regarding the discussions because, you know, this is the first time we we present. Initially, it looked like to us there was a a lot of support. We got know, three people and I by people, I mean, not the authors of the draft. And I mean, different companies, obviously, expressed support for adoption for the three other people mentioned they were facing similar issues and and wanted, we're having similar challenges. During the first presentation, we made one person was having, some concerns and we're saying right, okay, that the other solution was, was the the solution that the working group was pushing Since then, there hasn't been any, really been any, objection or has been a little bit of support absolutely no objection. And, So two things may might be happening right now. Is there there is actually a strong support for it in which case, I think it's it could be good to do an option call. Or there are actually people who are against it and may have reasonable concerns, but we are not hearing them. In which case, call would be a good idea to you know, have them expose their concerns.

So, actually, one of the things I have to comment in, you know, That creating 144, you know, I IP successes take less than a, you know, the 10th the second. What's the problem? I ask you, the problem is that you don't support, I version 2, which is windowing mode. So you are actually doing round trips, 144 round trips. The issue. If you have a window No. We we we we could do we we could send all the messages. It's just a lot of messages. We have don't have one peer. We have thousands of peers like that. Yeah. Yeah.

Mostly mostly at the microphone now, because in the past, I was sort of a little nervous because of the IPR statements with this. And, other than that, I I think I kind of flipped around now. We, It seems to be like, everyone has a patent on this. And so at some point, it doesn't really seem to matter anymore. I I don't see a danger anymore for the IETF to continue this work. Because of patterns, because, like, There will be ten people with patents fire fighting who will be the first one. I I I think at this point, the patent issue is sort of no longer a problem for this draft. And and seeing that many people have implemented this secretly over the last 10 years, apparently, anyway, remind us how to sort of try and and and and and and standardize officially. Alright.

So we started using it There was always a concern. Like, this is not really standardized. So if everyone knows there are 2 modes well known like the IP sectoral mode and transport mode. There was also a 3rd mode for the last 20 years. The beat mode which has been used by some some of us and because the strong Swan supported at using an IQ to private notification, it's it all worked within the the close community So there was always interest to, like, okay, let's write it down and get the, identifier and get the, bit more standardized. Instead of that. Expire draft. And then I didn't know this before, but the bot, notified us, it's actually standardized in the RFC 7402. Thank you, dear, dear, for next slide."

Like, standardized, but clarify if there are anything missing from the ESP part and then combine we can start using it. Next slide. So I think I covered most of the history here. It is from 2000 2009 around the 6 expired in 2010 to 2015, the new RFC, which now we know exists came around and got it standardized as a appendix. The next slide. And currently, what okay. So let's just go back a bit and see what is it actually useful. Currently, it's a use for end to end systems. It can only support an, one address a source address and destination. So it is a slash 32 for vipv4and/128 for ipv6. So by doing so, like, every packet, you say 20 bytes minimum of more than up to 40 bytes depends on the options. And ipv6, you save up to 40 bytes for every package. It's also used, in the heap, which is actually what where it on Saturdays right now. And it's also referred in the minimal ipsec RFC 9333. I think that RFC also missed. This is actually standardized somewhere else. So it's been around for a while and we're using it. Using it.

And, cost of this, for MAP, when the chip process the, ESP packet, the encrypted ESP packet, it needs to catch the data before it can get the next to header. And, but this is a pinpoint because the chip like like, the mode of decrypt and the transmit. It means you decrypt how much how many dates and then transmit to the next stage and do not do catch because catching may be, expensive cost. Positive for that chip, and you need to add to cost the cheap areas. For, implement and and then this chip area means more chip area means more energy consumption, which is not eco friendly. Next slide, please. And also, we have 2, possible optimizations. First, because this super high object for premise is only needed at the limited scenarios. So and that these scenarios usually are using yes, return on mode. So maybe we can only, implement the optimization for USB tunnel mode is to judge the type of in the IP header according to its first byte, a byte because the first byte of ipv4 header or ipv6 header indicates the IP version. And this is easy to implement, but, it As I just said, it only supports the ESP terminal mode and, Also, the dummy packet function may not be supported. Next slide, please. And"

So for our consideration, because we are not familiar with the IV sector history, and I don't know if there any specific, reasons put in USB trailer at the end of the packet. And, I also want to hear whether this problem was solved and the, whether there is some reasonable solution yet. Thank you Alright. We are quite out of town, so very quick. Okay. You suggested that, what I heard was you're thinking about forwarding the the decrypted packet before the authentication check. That is a really, really bad idea with GCM. Don't do that. In addition, if you're worried about transport, if you're using transport mode, you're appointees use these you're not gonna be running at these these gigabyte, per second rate. So that's to me, a lesser concern. Thank you. I mean, let me explain a little I didn't mean transmit the packet immediately out of that ship. Just to the next stage of the chip Yep. Yep. Hi, Hannes.

It's not really cashing in the in a sense of what chips to it's like you need to to process this? Like, are we talking about an off the shelf chip?

Just recall her dad, Both bucking about after that. When I Okay. probably when I was a chair, I'm not sure of this. And and as Steve's Yes. We put it specifically at the end. I remember this discussion so that you're finished processing the packet And then you got the next section of what followed. So you didn't have to hold the next header wire passes in the first data.

And if you want to move forward, there are support of the trailer means pending, then you lose the properties. Was a very good reason at the end. It depends the length of the encrypted part of the ESP packet up to the requirements that may be imposed by encryption algorithm. For example, CBC needs to be for CPC, you need to be data align with a, block of used to cipher. And there's no such as your requirements currently for GSM, for example, but generally, they can arise later. So we don't you you you in your proposal, if you need to if you move all the trailer, you will lose this this ability to for data to be aligned So you need to reconsider your proposal. For this Okay.

So, there's a there's a demand from our customers that, When a tunnel goes down, they don't really know why the tunnel goes down. They don't know whether they need like an instant or whether the machine is just gonna get rebooted or whether the a simple restart or a software update, and they kind of want want to know that, we send a signal with the delete tunnel command so that, the the other end can be informed by the tunnel goes down.

Initially, I thought of a free form message, but then I realized it might be useful to actually maybe a sub registry, with an enum so that we actually all use the same reasons. For ease of implementation, expect. So my one question is is the tools, architect seconds, useful? Or is it over engineering? And then, maybe we can do an enum and maybe an open string where we can put custom things in. So internally, you could even have something like Paul Valdez rebooted this host, for, you know, based on stuff like his power his power is gonna go out in 5 minutes. And that's it. So here are a few reasons that we figured out that were useful to actually, say why we're deleting it. And in fact, the, the most interesting reasons were actually came up with, after talking to Anthony. And so we have these cases where we have a simultaneous rekey, or we have an initial con contact message. Or or an IQVIA authentication or a redirection accepted where we actually We very well know the reason why we're doing things. We do not we're not relaying that information down to the pier.
