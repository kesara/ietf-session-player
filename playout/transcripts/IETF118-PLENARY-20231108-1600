Keep it going for this meeting and all future meetings and all interactions on the IITF. Denies to each other. If you're joining us online, there's some some tips on the slide for you. Your audio will be off and also your video will be off. So no need to get dressed or anything like that. When you're when you're joining the queue, Get ready to, when you recognize, unmute yourself, and if you have have the ability to be addressed at that point and send this video, we would appreciate seeing you and not just hearing you, but that's optional. If you have a headset, use it, or if you're reasonably sure your audio setup works, you know, try that. And there's more details on the link below. Also in the room, I don't know what's on the next slide. So I'm gonna say it now. Use the online, on-site tool to get in queue scan the QR code, that you see up there. You should be familiar with how this works. And, use that. There's a chat. Which is, available to you if you get to board during the initial, part of the presentation Be nice to each other also in the chat. This is our agenda. You notice we don't have the usual plaque handover. Clapping, thanking the host thing. That's because, unfortunately, we don't have a host for this meeting. Business No, Colin."

Which go over the usual participant statistics for this meeting that in the grand edition of these things, I haven't seen yet. And some other, items of interests. So we had, 1700 registration, 7 17148 that includes a 1060 on-site. So excellent. That's, I think, the biggest On-site, we had since COVID, And I think also the 688 remote is the highest number we've seen since COVID. And also, I think during COVID, we that was It's still pretty high up there. So so a big meeting as as usual, when we go to Europe and usually when we procs are well done. 351 ended, almost all of them were used. Those were the remote fee waivers. Colin and I have a very small number of in person fee waivers that we're giving out. I think each of us has 10, if I remember correctly, somehow I managed to give out 12, don't ask me, you know, how that happened. But two of you were very lucky. And Colin has stuck to his allotted limit. We got a few more requests and and some of them, you know, we, decided not to grant for very We we had a very substantial hackathon, presence again on the weekend if you were here for that.

We keep trying to provide them to you for your diligent review. We've, updated one on, in person, online interim meetings. We also did one on support documents in our IETF working groups. Both of those, I think, were updates of existing ones. We did one that I have later slides on, which was to, merge parts of the art and transport areas and I'm gonna say a few more words of that. And then we did one on the results of that community consultation. We had an appeal on, the revised statement on the earlier slide. That that the ISU rejected, and as far as standard is now, raised again with the IV and they are deliberating it. And there's more reports, from the IAB, the LLC boards, herret and IANA, at that URL.

The which area, alluded to this earlier, This is, a merger that the w comes from web, and it comes from internet transport. What we're doing is, the the IHG has sort of done in trend analysis of what's happening terms of the growth of various areas and art has always been for a while has been the largest by far. And also if you look at where do buffs happen, And where does new work start, It's typically art and sect that have the strongest, a tractor for new work at the moment. And that became a problem. Art already has had 2 eighties now. We we added a third But looking at the curve, we could almost justify a 4th, and that felt a little unbalanced. And art is also because of that growth, spreading out into quite a few topic areas. And so As part of the retreat, we did earlier in the year, we sat down and figure it out. Is there something we can do in terms of restructuring how the work is organized in the IHS. So it doesn't change the content of what you're doing in the work So this is just basically giving you"

That is sort of the most important conservation. Also, it turns out we probably want data for more than 1 IETF meeting. Before we make a final decision. So for Brisbane, you can you can book your travel under the assumption that Friday is a full day ending at 5 ish. Right. And that brings us to keep Ukraine connected So we're in Prague, and this is a, a group of people but, has quite a few IT efforts involved that basically have been expecting, equipment from from various parts, and, sending it to Ukraine to keep them on the internet. And Jan is gonna say a few words about that effort. Thank you, Lars. My name is Jan George. I'm from Global Eagle Alliance and connect. I have a few minutes to tell you about this stuff. So many moons ago, we started the global Nobel Alliance, that's a not for profit organization to help network operators group around the world. And, this is our motto. Next slide, please. I can press. Okay. Okay. This is our motto. Our IT tech community is 1 big family. We don't think in colors. We don't think in races or genders. We we don't think in borders. We try to be as neutral and nonpolitical us possible. And, After that, conflicting you Ukraine started, and we started receiving images like this. See people in the trenches trying to connect fiber together to keep people connected to the internet. And we thought that it would be nice to help keeping people in Ukraine connected to the internet and have access to the information."

As you see, the working conditions here here are not great. I will never again complain about my working conditions. Yeah. So then we we ask the wider internet operators community. To donate equipment that they don't need if you do the technology refresh on your network you don't need router switches servers and that stuff, to send it to us, and we have volunteers that, load this equipment on the trucks and vans and drive them into the Ukraine. To hand them over to the operators that need equipment to rebuild the network. And the reaction was amazing if you participated in this project and are in this room, thank you very much. It was it was really, really, really helpful. Because we managed to to gather a lot of stuff. So for the equipment that we sent, you have the numbers there. I will not read them all. But, one of the most important one is fiber splicer. Because they need to connect and we managed to ship, 41 fiber splicers. This is quite expensive. This is where the money donation went mostly to buy the fiber splicers, to send them there. Also 490 access points. To install in the shelters when the bombing is happening when bombs are coming down so people can still be connected when they lose the mobile signal, and talk to their families and say that there's the there's there are still life."

But our resources are very limited as this is a completely voluntary work, and it's just a bunch of us that are coordinating this stuff. And, if you can help in any reasonable way, contact us come to us and we will try to also help other places around the world to receive the same sort of help like Ukrainians did because we thought that, this would be a good blueprint to also help in cases of other disastrous conflict, civil unrest and so on.

I am right reliably informed that monsoons will finish on March 15th. So but it will be very warm. It's a it's a lovely city Brisbane, if you've never been to, has a lovely waterfront. It's all been redeveloped. It's just got a nice, modern feel to it. It's It's friendly. It is, Oceania. So all of coffee is good. You do not have to search around trying to find specialist coffee. I know it's a long way, but it's actually very cheap, hotel rooms, which will, we think, will substantially offset the cost, extra cost of flight for most of you, which is like a little plea, for your coming on to that meeting. We'll be opening, registration soon after this meeting. We'll give you some of those room costs as well. We think this is gonna be a great meeting. We haven't yet quite signed the meeting host, but we're in negotiations of people, so it won't be too long. Hope before that is arranged. And we have at least one ITFO who lives locally who has an outstanding motor site collection and has promised to try and bring some of those along. So, definitely this is a meeting to come to. So here's our list of, future meetings 119 is in Brisbane. 120, as we know, is in Vancouver. And Huawei will be, the host for that one. 121 is in Dublin, and we've just announced this as the host of that meeting. Thank you very much, Cisco. That is gonna be a fantastic meeting as well.

And then we're working on 124 North America and 125 Asia. And then we're back to Vienna because those of us who are there enjoyed it so much, we thought the rest of you come too and enjoy it.

First, the timeliness and accuracy of financial statements So, thankfully, our new, part time director Finance Debbie has helped us here tremendously. What we ended up having a problem with 4 was our monthly statements would come several months after we expected them in some cases. And they were sort of riddled with errors, that we would have to go back and correct. And, that took a lot of time and that he has magically solved all that stuff, for us, and things are really, really cracking that, which is great. So that is, you know, basically complete at this point We continue to focus on fundraising, that's, certainly important to us. These are everything from small donors, to very large donors.

So to keep meetings going and those kinds of things. As well as a matching program for, grants that other organizations might make to us. And so there are 2 things going on with respect to that.

And we've had 0 direct license requests. Now let me seem like we're not doing anything. That's kind of a goofy number. Let me explain a little bit. We have a built in licensing scheme for all the RFCs and all the contributions made to the ICF that says, hey. You don't need to come to negotiate a license with us. You can just use it to do your work at the IETF And if you did an RFC and you wanna take that RFC and reproduce it without editing or modifying it, You can just do it. Don't need to negotiate a separate license. So the beauty of that scheme is that we don't have to write licenses to everyone of you and everybody that wants to use the work of the IETF, they can just use it. It's beautiful model and the trust is at the heart of that. So we didn't do anything special. Quarter. That's a good thing. So the big thing we've been working on And I talked about this for the last few meetings is the restructuring of the trust We are structuring, for a bunch of reasons, which we've talked about before, to a, Delaware, not for profit corporation. The great news is last time I came to talk to you, we were on this hold where we were waiting for, approval from the IRS in the US because we're a US entity, to become a full legitimate nonprofit. We have been approved by the IRS. We are now off a nonprofit 5163 that the new corporation to current trust, of course, already was a 51c3, now this means that we can proceed with the next phase of the operation which is transferring the assets for the current trust.

So relatively, like, the split between what's in the endowment I think is relatively low publicized. It's actually, like, the smaller of the percentages at this point because it, again, it's the smaller one that's that started out with you people donating 100 of dollars and then a couple more from there.

Are are you seeing that they're being exclusive or exclusionary in the work? We we looking at bringing them down? Are you looking at other strategies to to mitigate the effects that they might have. Yeah. So first, maybe let's double click on waivers, which I think is your domain what are the numbers looking like? Meeting in the last few. So we're Colin and I asked the the chairs right? The top 2 people. So so we we each have a discretionary budget. And it's not terribly large. And and so, the largest part of mine and I think also the largest part largest parts of Collins goes towards paying these papers. So each of us sort of set aside money for 10 waivers out of that.

Firstly, We do everything possible to make it clear to people the way that the online fee the process works is no questions are asked. You said we'd rather be impossible to avoid that that dignity issue or other things, for people there. And so, and it's difficult to see and if you have any ideas for improvement, how we could do that without effectively know, significantly undermining ordinary sales, then please let us know about that, but that's the dilemma in there. The the the one important thing to note about the IETF this is the only point and then we do whatever possible to allow people to interact without doing it. Everything the people who go to other STOs tell me is is one of the lowest cost SDOs to be engaged with. You look at all those other considerations put together. Now, that is we do not receive money through anything else other than donations. We can't, you know, be in a process where we have a,"

We should hopefully be publishing meeting budgets for last year, proper ones now like that. But if you take a meeting like this where we don't have a meeting host. That's a $360,000 hole immediately. It's made up by the fact that we have probably at least 150 to 2 were more than we were expecting on-site so that, you know, could close to a 100,000 or more dollars there, take off tax and stuff. So you know, it it it gets better, but it it we have to make some various different trade offs here. And what we think we're doing is think reasonable putting all of that together. It's been discussed with the community in lots of different ways. So I mean, the board can all answer on the long term trajectory of this of where we want to go. But at the short term, I don't think it's anything short can be done. But I'm well aware you have to balance the budget. But but you use the word trade offs, and I think that's an way to look at it. So, for example, Lars talked about sponsorship but we have diversity and inclusion sponsors. Is any of that money going towards this cost, for example? That's what pays in fee waivers. Absolutely. 10? I I heard that there were 10 for each of the No. No. No. For the online fee waivers as well. I see. So, and it there are, some people do give us money for grants as well. For, people just to expect it to be a larger component. The other thing I'd suggest you you maybe look into is other organizations index, other fees based upon where someone's coming from. And there's the the economic status of that place. So me as a person from a relatively place, I would be happy paying more than I pay now, even though it's a lot. If I knew that other folks could pay less. Okay. The only other thing I wanna add probably shouldn't say this. Like, but, like, you know, it's hotel cost, right? Things are getting more expensive.

So, you know, we're not coming back here for a long time because it's getting more expensive. There's other places for example, in the US that we looked at where the hotel costs are.

And mostly because I know that there is community here either working on sustainability, or questions of entity, censorship, or I think the workshop was biased. And I was wondering if you've given any thoughts to how these investments are placed And if there is space there to, for instance, think about how can we make sure that whatever we invest the IETF money in is, for instance, sustainable companies and not Not too similar.

The the the guest passes are basically an experiment because we we kept having, people that were invited 2 sessions, many of them newcomers, remote participants, and they did not understand that needed to make a data tracker account or register and take a fee waiver And so they basically showed up at at 9 AM in the morning and couldn't get in. And that caused a lot of chairs, a lot of stress. And then it also caused a lot of sectarian stress and medial stress and so on. And so we created this guest passcode option where you can basically for a one off thing get quickly get a code for a speaker so you don't have to, like, postpone your meeting for Get, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, So that that's where they came from.

Okay. We do have attention here. Everybody that comes to the IETF and 8s in the IETF does so voluntarily, you know, and supports the IETF in that way. They dedicate their time.

Think the most recent data point that we had that was very qualitative was the report on the experience of women. Coming to IETF Meetings.

Anytime anything else meets, the ADs have to go cover their own meetings. They can't go to these general area meetings.

I will point out that a that a few years back, we had to exact deposit discussion and the community wanted way more site meeting time and way more time that wasn't taken by formal sessions. Right? So there's a pendulum here, and it keeps going this way and that way. Which doesn't mean that we can't do anything sensible.

At the same time, we also have difficulty because our farming is very limited. We also have a set of criteria, and we have to hash it out. Not everyone who applies to us can go. At the same time, I feel you are capable of doing this because you're doing it with the fee waivers. It's not entirely impossible, and I understand it's it's difficult. But sometimes to bring in a diverse set of voices, we're gonna have to do difficult things."

So, regarding the visa difficulties, you know, I I mean, certainly, I think many of us can sympathize with with the troubles that causes. And, unfortunately, we have no, little to no impact on immigration and immigration laws, but I I will say that Jay has been working on an effort to make it so much easier for us to meet in places we haven't met much in the past. Countries really met much in the past, and, that's going through the gen area. There's a document there to update some RFCs to make that easier. I I don't think we're gonna stop meeting in the in the in the, the traditional countries you meet, but maybe at least sometimes you can get to places to more accessible. To more people. Zemin. Robin. Can I just So you wanna, yeah, by the way, then be quick, Raul? Yeah. Yeah. To the point that it's difficult to be, there are visa difficulties if decisions are made timely and documentation, etcetera is available timely it simplifies the process a lot. So you can do that also, destination matters like Shenzhen is especially tough for some some some reason, and it's not my first time. I've lived in Sweden for 3 years. Every time there is a problem. So there is a pattern to this behavior also switch can be learned about if you talk to enough people. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So in fact, I have this, the comments on the since that happens in the routing area and also the NPR's working group here. Because of the I'm Charles Logan girl chair. Laura was forced to be replaced. And, I doubt the process And the reason in the Middle East, I think the response on ID"

But, I think that's the only reason you still use to inject, this is the new opinions, or that's is in the as the only the reason to replace the working group chair. So I think that kind of needs to be explained more So I should make this more apparent Thank you. Ruben. As as use, as I said to you, in a reply on the MPLS list regarding this. The decisions with regards to appointment and replacement working group chairs. Are things that are taken with very careful deliberation they are done in order to ensure that working groups function, in the most harmonious way to find the consensus that we need to build open standards Those decisions are very often, very, very difficult to make both on the replacement the appointment They require a lot of communication, a lot of which happens off list which which you're not going to go in divulge publicly because there were a lot of things that come in when those decisions are made and they are made for very careful reasons. And yes, as you noticed, a working group chair was replaced And I think that the mail that was sent in response to your mail gave a as much detail as is appropriate because of the communication.

I think that the process does say that working group chairs, serve at the pleasure of the ADs I think that that's important because I think there has to be a trust relationship between the working group says in the ID. The decision was made and job. I think that's pretty much I can say about that. Okay. So my list is the question is that one because you I'm a precise this, deliberation, and the consultants consultation. And also if you're using because this is a very exceptional case in the shooting. I rear. So I think, I think that the 2 option, the 1st option maybe you can exploit explain what's the deliberation or the consulting consult a consultation maybe a second option. We just emphasize the outer com. So what's the care for reasons. Yeah. Because I think now this is the only reason is that inject this, the new perspective I don't understand. I use very reasonable reasons. Yeah. That's my point. Thank you. Abdul Salam. Has, as my comment, for, for the ISG I would like also to, to to to know, yeah, the way, of the work how do they work with the chairs or the work of chairs? Is is is there some, kind of clear procedure as the way they replace or don't don't replace. So that that needs to be clear to to about any participant."

Actually, my question was regarding a newcomers newcomers. They need, I see my servation or my belief that they are decreasing. They are not increasing when I I work in some working groups. So I hope that there is a strategic plan as I heard from the LLC, they are already having a plan and asking the community what what's your feedback on the career, the strategy plan, is there a strategy plan from the point of the 80s ISG for newcomers and, who are going, let's say, or leaving us as I am not sure how many people are coming and going. So so we have to have at least a strategy This is the most important issue for I, IETF. Thank you. So Jay is generating data for us. He did the all, IETF participants already try to ask about, you know, people for reasons for joining and leaving the organization, and we're analyzing this. And and the ISVs working together with the LLC on So LSC owns a lot of the, meeting related, aspects of making a newcomer experience a good one. The ISG owns the the technical content of that, right, so we we do keep working together, and we we do try to identify ways in which you can improve that. And we're gonna ask again after this meeting how did go for the newcomers and the post meeting survey and take actions, but it's a it's a process. Right? Everybody in the in the organization and special leadership is aligned that we wanna have more newcomers. We wanna be welcoming environment for everybody. Wanna make it as easy as possible to come here. Real world considerations make that sometimes more difficult than than we want to and it's a process I think that everybody's committed to to go down the road on"

I started because of the AD was supporting me. But if I didn't get that support from I will not even stay for 1 month, with IITF. So I think it's important that we, the ed The new Eddies also, they put this into consideration. Yeah. I wouldn't only put it on the IDs. I mean, we have a mentoring program that try to formalize these more ad hoc relationships that that you benefited from and make them available more widely and also advertising more widely. But I think, Mary, I wanted to follow-up Yeah. I just wanted to ensure that, like, in all leadership groups, this is very high on the agenda. A topic we talk very often. We talked about it. Last Sunday. And what are and we have a bunch of activities the more EODier, is is working with mentors and newcomers I think also outreach is a point like just going out and actually talking about the ITF's people know that how it works and that they are aware of it. So there's like a whole bunch of things. And I do agree to the point that we need to bring little bit more strategy into that and actually make a plan and then execute in that. And that's also something that we discussing. Thank you. I'll just say also, make a general point about the comment about sort of transparency about chair assignments, without speaking about the merits of this case, which I'm not particularly familiar with that so that these are essentially personnel actions and there are reasons to remove a chair should not be disclosed in public. Right. We got 3 minutes and 3 people in the queue. So if you're in the queue, please be brief. I'm not much I can't congratulate? That's nice. Next in queue. Okay. Okay. Go ahead.

I looking at, mailing lists when, working group products are pushed over to ISG Once in a while, I did see so many changes coming out of that that I would like to, ask Well, okay. What is your feeling? Whether, Well, okay. Let's rework should be required or is is is that something that is in general at an acceptable level. Of for this kind So, really, Gary, clearly, when during the ISG evaluation, the content is technically changed We typically run another IETF last call. Because we need to get a consensus on what they've changed. Now whether it has been done all the times, I cannot guarantee, but normally it tells the process and I sing all my fellow ladies are doing the same as I Okay. So kind of the fall follow there would be. I haven't done any statistics on this. I just remembered, some observations is anybody running, statistics So we see what percentage of last recall, recycling happens. So let me quickly hop on as well.

I don't think you can really just do a useful thing other than reading them all. Although I would point out that people send better review documents to the IS there'll probably be less changes when we do that let me add to that as well. I actually recently sent a document back a couple of weeks ago where I felt that the the diff was too big and that I couldn't really determine anymore whether this still had working group consensus So I actually send it back to the work group for a short work group last call. And that's definitely, I think that what what, in general, the responsible AD does after it goes the process from when it's come, from publication requested through the pipeline. And just before sending it to the RFC editor, you have to check and see, like, okay. How are these changes? Are are there actually any like, like, mustard or or shoot keyword change because that could be a single line. That'd be enough to send it back to the working group. Right?

The decision that Andrew had to make was a difficult one. But I believe that it was absolutely necessary. The relevant working group has been dysfunctional for a very, very long time. And without making a change, it was going to continue in that way. And that's simply not acceptable. The decision was regrettable. I wish that there had been better way. But I definitely support it.

And the other thing I'll say is that there was actually wonderful outpouring of thanks to Loha on the MPLS mailing list after that action. Which I thought was great. And I have nothing bad to say about that. But I, I will disagree that there was no opportunity to expressed respect for law and of Thank you. Thanks, all. I close to q.
