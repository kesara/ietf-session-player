Bob has volunteered. Thank you so much, Bob. Next slide. Okay. So let me start with the bad news and good news. As you can see, this is a younger version of Mark And Mark is pretty busy. He has started looking into some different technology area, and he could not spend as much time. This group was just taking a lot of time. And so they're in stepping in, and this is a good time for Eric, you wanna say something? No. I simply want to mark launches in a flight back home. Was there a snack time has been changed at the last minute. So depending on getting the flight. ASMP, as an ADI, want to thanks on the minutes. So but if you can put in the minute that Eric Eric is thinking Mark, for, you know, cheer and thinking Darren to come back. So Yeah.

Some segment routing work. several years ago. Now that's gone by fast. Bob and I spent a lot of time together. got to know each other very well. But, yeah, I'm I'm happy to help out and happy to volunteer. my time and energy, and with this great group of people and what we can do with snack. Looking forward to it. Thank you, Darwin. Again, So we have Just one document, and Ted's going to talk about it. This is simple o one, and as of six to 4 AM this morning, we have version 2. So I I spoke to Ted offline here been just too busy to upload the document and since this is the only document, we made an exception to kind of bypass the procedure and not have document before the deadline and still talk about it.

And I kinda went through the document in detail today to figure out exactly what we do to get to working group last call because that's what we all want. Right?

So let's go to let's go to the next slide. So situation with the document, I just as I said, the update's pretty editorial. There are a few sort of technical issues, but no substantial changes. And so we're we're we've pretty much been in a holding pattern since the dash 0 version was published. And so I've just been going I I just went over it. I read their introduction today and noticed that there are a few issues with it. One of the issues is that when we talked about what to put in the simple document. There were some controversy over whether we wanted to have support for PD and the simple document or whether that one was gonna go with the second document we ultimately decided to put in a simple document but the introduction still reads as if we haven't put it in the simple document. So So I've I've actually done a post 2 editorial change to the introduction to fix that. And so that's about it for the introduction. Next slide. So I'm just gonna go through the document by section. This is Like I said, it's a bit detailed. Hopefully, this is of interest to somebody here. So the first section is on managing addressability on the on the AIL, the the adjacent Infrastructure Lincoln. managing addressability means making sure that there's an IP address for host to use to communicate with devices on some network So this section is pretty complete. except that I think it's a little bit the organization is a little weird. We have a section that's explicitly talking about the usable pre which is know, if there's a prefix on infrastructure already, we don't have to publish one. you what does a prefix like that look like? And So later on in the document, we talk about, like,"

    "text": "how to how to, you know, sort of the details of how to how to reason about the usable prefix. And that isn't in the usable prefix section, which seems a little bit dumb. So This is particularly for the case where you might have competing Stub routers providing a usable prefix on the link and what to do there. So There are a few sort of organizational changes So this is just kind of, like, a to do list. There's nothing terribly exciting or controversial here. Next slide. managing addressability on the stub network, Basically, when I wrote that section, I haven't I had just written the previous section, which gave detailed instructions on how to including a state machine. on how to manage the AIL prefix. And so I basically just referred back to that section. It didn't say much more. But it turns out that probably wasn't enough. So this section needs a little work. the handling like, there isn't we don't anticipate there being a prefix on the STUB network that was published by infrastructure. The whole point is the the the the stub router is essentially the infrastructure. So that bit needs to be we need to to have a to talk about that difference. And We also maybe need to talk a little bit about how things happen with respect to partitioning, although I think we're fairly solid on that. So again, there's no major changes required here, but I think this document be a little more this this section needs to be a little more prescriptive and so that that can easily rewrite again, these these notes, I'm actually thinking of as a to do list for the document editors, which is me and Jonathan. So next slide. So then there's a pair of sections about maintaining the AIL prefix and generating the ULA prefix to provide reachability. And These sections are kind of related to the previous sections that I just discussed."

And, also, we had some theories about how was gonna work. in the sort of early days of thread that we wound up deciding didn't work that well. on In particular, if you have multiple stub routers connected to the same infrastructure that are providing transit to the same stub network. If the PIO that's advertised by a stub router on infrastructure changes over time, This can create reachability problems. And It turns out that for thread, Thread has an identifier that's associated with the network. It's a nice big random number And So we actually just use that to produce a ULA prefix And that means that every router that's providing transit to that thread network is always gonna advertise that PIO which means that the PIO is gonna be changing all the time. which means that you don't have these reachability problems I was just describing. for the WiFi stub router use case, I'm not sure how to think about that. The WiFi stub router use case is a use case where we don't actually have a customer for it. We're keeping it in mind just so that we don't sort of constrain what we're doing with stub networks to only the thread you case. because the whole goal of doing the stub stub router subnetworks work in IETF. is to come up with a spec that's generalizable that that can be used for other use cases. And and by thinking about Wi Fi we we benefit from from it gives us an opportunity to sort of contrast compare. the one thing I think about that with Wi Fi is Wi Fi is not a mesh network at least typically, And So a self organizing Wi Fi mesh network is not really what we're the problem we're trying to solve here. And so I think that for Wi Fi networks, chances are you're only actually gonna have one stub router connecting you to the Wi Fi network"

And I'm curious if anybody has any sort of You know, if anybody 1st of all, disagrees with my position about a the Wi Fi use case because I think it would be interesting Julius disagrees. Excellent. Let's hear it. No. A moment is a greeting for once. I'm just a little bit concerned about your comment about using the Wi Fi SSID Yeah. I'm a little so I'm not saying anything about thread because I don't know thread But in the case of Wi Fi, you're mixing the layers here, which might cause issues, like, for example, from the Wi Fi link on the Wi Fi access point, is just a bridge and the router is actually an Ethernet router that's connected to the Wi Fi access want. So, you know, this kind of taking the ID and putting it at the network player, is I don't have any, you know, concrete example, but it's something that makes me nervous. Yeah. Yeah. I I I agree. I mean, I I'm not that thrilled with the SSID idea either. It was just an idea that we came up with the other day when we're talking about this that seemed better than nothing. But what I was saying about, like, the sort of single egress scenario, I think actually kind of addresses this because now we can just generate a ULA using a random number generator store it in stable storage and never change it. It's not a problem. Absolutely. I much preferred that. I feel much more comfortable with that. Yeah. Same. Same Cool. Cool. Okay. probably talked about this enough. Next slide."

I think we need 1. but but I've personally implemented a state machine, and I suspect there's won an open thread so I'm pretty sure we can come up with something. I don't I don't see this as an impediment to quick to quickly making progress. The other issue is we don't actually talk about keeping the prefix the OSNR prefix. That's the prefix that's advertised on the stub network. stable. we talk about keeping the Yeah. ALCreek is stable, but that's a slightly separate thing. Tim, did you wanna me to finish or you wanna jump in now? Okay. Either way, fine. Nope. Nope. No problem. But, anyway, so so It would be nice if we could come up with a way stable in in the threat implementation we currently don't. If router that's publishing the OSNR prefix goes away, We just renumber. Don't flock. And the problem here like, And this the previous delegation doesn't solve this problem because we still need a stable identifier to present to the to the DHGP server so that we get a consistent prefix back from it whichever router asks the question. We could use the X Pan ID for that, So so maybe we have an option there. But but we can't we're definitely we're definitely using the x pan idea a lot at this point, so we need to be a little careful about that. But yeah. So this is something I don't actually think that we need to solve this problem. for for the simple document, but I think we should think about whether there is maybe a follow on document that can talk about this or whether we actually do consider important enough to hold the the the simple document till we come up with a solution. Clarifying question. Do you mean IAID or DUID? My idea, mine -- You're right."

I I actually I'm pretty sure I wrote that section of the original r but that was a really long time ago. So, anyway, what I mean by that is the is the the the the the Full identifier that's being passed to the DHCP server to say, to to give an so the identity so I think the term is identity. So actually. So the the duID plus the IAID produces the identity association. and it's the Identity Association, the IA, that we want to have stable over time so that and and across different stub routers. if we can figure out a way to do that, I think that would be cool. Anyway, Tim, you've been wearing a lot. Ten churn. So it said, where is that prefix being used when you're talking. So so let me just review it for a moment. There there are basically 2 prefixes that we're talking There's the prefix on the AIL, the adjacent infrastructure link. So that's your Wi Fi network that you're sub routers connecting to or your or never, whatever that your stub router is connecting to, the northbound interface. And then stub network itself needs a prefix as well. And OSNR stands for off subnet routable prefix. So that's the prefix on the stub network. Yeah. Yeah. the term that we use in in the thread spec is the yeah, the OMR prefix, the off mesh router prefix, we had to add an extra letter here to make it more complicated Oh, yeah. So 10 to 9. I haven't really thought it through to maybe a stupid idea. But is there something in terms of getting the stable UNA prefix, I'm not sure of it. about the rules of generating your guys to do something Sorry? don't. Don't. for DXCP, it's global connectivity. Yeah. you're talking about the ULA 3 or 4 sides ago, and I haven't checked my buttons. So Yeah. So you're set you you there was a question at the bottom of that. Can we do better in terms of getting"

    "text": "ULA over reboots. Yeah. So I I kinda mashed that in here because I think it's the same problem. like, is there a way to agree on a thing that we can use to generate the OSNR prefix. so that we so that we deterministically always have the same OS in our prefix. This is slightly complicated by the fact that with the infrastructure link, we don't expect that to ever partition. But the stub network link, and certainly in the thread use case, least historically could partition. And when it partitions, you now need different OS and R prefixes on each partition. So that creates a problem when we're trying to make the OSNR prefix stable because Now you need multiple OS and our prefixes. You need some way to to deterministically identify each partition, which we don't have. Leave it up to the the the type of network that's trying to associate and, like, leave it up to the end of decide what it is for a for a Wi Fi network the August Canada is the BSS ID of the of the of the things connected to you. Right? Great. and the thread, you have one. Right? So you could say, well, it needs to be like, you need a point for you need a glob and legs. And that's the IDE and then you put in the IAD. I don't know if there's, like, any length limits in the IAD. maybe -- No. Not really. But then, yeah, then maybe you can say, well, that's up to the technology that's interrupting with you in the it's up to them to decide what is. But is it that you're sorry. It's in Channigan. Is it a deal? to do something like 7217, but you wanna stable ULA prefix per infrastructure prefix you'll you'll attaching to No. No. It's there there isn't a one to one map like that. just we we need a prefix for any broadcast domain that's on the subnetwork side, that needs to have a brief rub. Because if we if we have let's let's say that the subnetwork is partition, which can happen least at this point, it might not happen so much with thread, but we still need to account for the possibility happening happening happening happening happening happening happens with thread,"

That's the Wednesday saying with you. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. So, anyway, I I think this is a this is a a slightly open unsolved problem and and I don't know quite what to do about it, but I'm not sure that we need to solve this to get to to get to working group last call. on this document, I just think it's something we need to think about and maybe come up with a solution too that we could we could just you know, if we figure out a solution, before we're done with this, great. And if we don't, then we can just have that be an potential additional action item. So Next slide. Okay. Managing reachability from infrastructure to on the adjacent infrastructure link and on the stub map. So reachability is basically routes a route from the AIL to the subnetwork and a route from the stub network to the AIL, And routes are for prefix, so there might be multiple prefixes advertised on the AIL. and we might wanna advertise those routes individually on the stub network. just in case we have 2 different stub routers stub routers that are connected to 2 different infrastructures, but same stub network. that we know which writer choose to reach those specific prefixes.

Right? You it's a stub network. It only has one way out. interesting. Well -- That's the problem now. quite So, yeah, maybe it's maybe it's worth just a a moment of review here. the typical deployment scenario for this right now is that your stub router is speaker or set top box or something else. And You might have 10 of those in your house. and we kinda want there to be more than one of them because you might have one of on a power strip, and you might just turn off the power strip. because you don't know that it's acting as a router. You don't even know what a router is. Right? Like, you're just a know, you have a house and it's supposed to work. So so the whole goal of this is to ride over events like that. In order for that to happen, Certainly, for the thread use case, we we definitely wanna have multiple regressions. And when you have multiple regresses, you run into the risk that I just described, which is that they could be connected to different links. And when that happens, you wanna tell the devices that are on stuff network, which router do you use? Jonathan. Yes. No. I just Jonathan. So I just wanna provide some background. We've had a lot of discussion about this. whether we wanted to support Jason Infrastructure Links and different multiple the same time. Yep. NN, like, how we support that. Right? So -- Yeah. One answer is just we like, we're talking about default rough. Right? Yeah. Right. if if if you have a network that has is configured on multiple infrastructure links. and That's really could say that's a network configuration issue. Yep. Yep. Is that something that's prevalent in an actual consumer use case, which is -- Right. target market for threat, I think that's the key question. here, like, We wanna make sure users don't Users aren't really administuring their networks.

Lorenzo, I I didn't mean I didn't mean that you'd only pass the default, but you you can You can pass it all and some more specifics. Yeah. Right. So so there's I mean, one thing to say is that what Jonathan said is actually what we decided to do thread, which is basically we assume that if you have multiple adjacent infrastructure links. that you're running your network or that your network is that your network has working routing. basically, basically. If you have multiple adjacent infrastructure links and your network doesn't have working routing then to hell with you. We we just can't support them. Right? So So what you just said is basically right, Lorenzo, that we could just publish to fall around. And in fact, that's what we do. I'll tell I'll talk about that in the second presentation. But but just in in principle, can't remember how we got there from here. Oh, yeah. I was just talking about advertising more specific routes on on the stub network. Yeah. I think I think certainly for the simple document, it makes a lot of sense to not really try to dig too into this problem. for the exact reason that that Jonathan gave. That it's it's you know, we assume that that that that the target for for snack simple is a home network. And home networks shouldn't be complicated. And if they are, then we really hope that the home user knows what they're because otherwise they're in deep trouble. So so Next slide. And then discoverability, The document mentions all of stuff that we need to do but it doesn't actually say how to do it any kind of detail. And so and also, you know, it's a little vague about things like"

    "text": "SRP. So with thread, we do advertise SRP on the stub network because we don't wanna multicast on the stuff network to do service discovery. for reasons that I think or we don't really need to talk about here. I think it's pretty obvious. But, you know, suppose we have a Wi Fi. set up. wanna advertise SRP on the WiFi network? Currently, nobody supports it. but but but Maybe if we specify a way that they could use it than they would. So So we could talk about that. And and the SRP document actually says how to advertise it. So all we would really have to say is you should do this. So and then you know, another thing is, like, the DNS resolver in a stub network needs to do a bunch of different things. needs to act as a discovery proxy so that you can discover MDNS Services on this on the infrastructure link. It needs to act as a DNS resolver so that you can discover devices on the Internet. and also internal networks for that matter. And it needs to act as an SRP server. And, you know, it probably should support DNS push so that you can do DNSSD, you know, one of the features of DNS SSD is the ability to do ongoing browse so you can see what a new service shows up. you probably want DNS push. So None of this is at all difficult, but right now the document doesn't actually specify this, and I think So that's that's what to do to do list for this section. Next, And then reachability for ipv4. So one of the simplifying assumptions with snack is that The stub network is an ipv6 It's not an IP before network. We're not providing that We're not providing DHCP If you're connected to the stub network, you're responsible for generating your own address and you're responsible for listening for RAs and sending a router solicited if you wanna see what the current situation is."

So if if the device that's in the cloud is an ipv6 device. and you have DHCP then you can communicate with it. If the device that's in the cloud is an ipv4 device, then you need some kind of net 64. So so So there and and this section right now is there's kind of a nice long problem statement that I think is useful but I'm not sure that it's that useful for an implementer. because it's basically just justifying the decisions that we made. And I think for an implementer, what you really wanna know is what should I So I'm thinking that we might wanna sort of change the section around a little bit, maybe put the justification in appendix or Maybe we leave it the way it is.

I mean, it's never it's never the the the I mean, if you're an implementer having more background is better and you can always skip the places that don't interest you.

So we were able to say If you're a vendor making device with a thread radio, with IP networking stack, then you will do local synthesis. Those are the rules of the game. put that code in open thread, pretty much everybody uses open thread these days. problem solved, The broader applicability of snack at the IETF is not just threads of networks, but it's other kinds of stuff networks. like, Ethernet, that might have legacy hosts. So that's why the the the the calculus here is different because the target and which devices we're supporting is different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Although, you know, to Jen's point, if if we're if we're 90% of the way there, stub networks the the stub network Wi Fi use case is You know, the only the only actual practical use case that I can think of for this is your home router should be able to be a subnetwork so that if the end user plugs one home router into the back of another home router Everything works, and you can print and and, like, discover your light switches and stuff. which currently is the case. So know, with with a with an existing home router, that doesn't work. So that's we we aren't really trying to solve that problem here, but Nevertheless, it would be nice if that if that succeeded.

So, I My opinion is that it relying on an external DNS 64. this shouldn't be mandatory for this function to work that that. exists because in most cases that it there will be It won't be a dual stack network if it's a, like, a home network. or something, and it almost, like, not be at the end of 64 function Up street. that that would be my guess. Right. Well, but the subnetwork could do DNS 64. It could do it. It's Yes. Yeah. But I'm saying it I don't know if you require this says that there should be an external DNS for for this to work. I don't think No. We're not requiring that. Oh, yeah. That's that's not what we're saying. That is on partner. To be a little bit bit more pessimistic on the previous question on how widespread implementation of this are. As soon as you look at anything, limits based, it's very much distribution slash application Mhmm. Question. Like, if if you have to use some open WRT box, then, hopefully, this is the right thing. there are so many implementers and it's gonna be total hit on this. But at the same time, I also think the real question here is what do you do if your thermostat did the right thing in those ipv6, and the cloud for the thermostat does the right thing in those ipv6. what your ISP is IP before only. Right. And that is the real hard question, I think. Yeah. Because we can tell people building those products that they really should be using after the 6 now, doesn't help fix the network. Yeah."

I actually don't know yet if it's achievable in the, like, this Wild West of devices around, but I start thinking it's probably the best deployment scenario, we shall be both Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. bear in mind that we don't support IP before on the stub network.

And so maybe we should just be optimistic. And you know what? If if Somebody who's implementing this needs to do some needs to implement DNS 64 because they have a specific problem they're trying to solve they can do that, but we don't need to specify that.

I a bit of background, about why in the thread group we decided not to use DNS 64. it's not just a religious objection to DNS 64. We had some technical debate about the right way to solve this. and one of the strong arguments is that we would like to see more use of DNS and dennis 64. is incompatible with DNS because DNS 64 is synthesizing records, aka forging records, and DNS decide to prevent forgery. So by saying in the thread, well, all plans do sentences locally it enables those devices to do end to end DNS sec validation and then do their own synthesis locally, which they trust because they're doing it. GNS export basically blows up. in a second makes it and and makes it impossible to ever do that. So that was really think the deciding argument Yep. David and Carter. I need to disagree with Julius. not the 4 fours. Am I going to help here? The definition of a stop network is that it doesn't have traffic transiting it, it may have more than one exit. And as soon as we have more than one exit, What are you gonna do when your IPV 4 traffic starts moving between your multiple exits? This just doesn't work. You're doomed. Well, Yeah. that 64 is the same problem. Right? But But I I I I don't object to people implementing for, but, you know, we do need a solution for networks that aren't IP before. And so those definitely need to be specified here. We can We can say maybe, like, if you support IP before, you don't have to do not 64. But y, mean, I mean,"

I have a question because I just don't know what we're dealing with. do we expect devices use short party DNS and not one provided by the network. Because if you do them, like, whatever router sends you in our end. It does not doesn't really matter. I mean, an. I just don't know if like those. IoT devices or Samsung might decide that I want to connect to like, particular surpassed Yeah. mean, if It's a it's, you know, it's it's it's it's your device. Right? You can have it talk to whatever IP does the nation you want to. And what you wanna do is send a DNS query there. We're not gonna necessarily stop you. But we might. I mean, there might be there might be a a firewall. I think this is another reason to have devices do That's it. 4 sentences locally. my understanding with services like Google's 48. is If you do a query for AAA for a host name that doesn't have a AAA, it will do the synthesis using the default, that 64 prefix. So for many installations, kind of by dumb luck, you get the right behavior as long as you're using to default. So I mean, That's the answer to your question, but really the deeper point is This is one of the reasons we're not a fan of DNS 64."

So since any device, any laptop can become a stub router. do you protect your home network against it? Yes. So how So If somebody has you know, has has your Wi Fi password? then they can connect your Wi Fi and they can send whatever packets you're Wi Fi is willing to forward. So there is this thing called RAGuard, which We hope isn't on your home network because if it is the stub router will stop working. And RAGuard prevents you essentially from advertising foreign routes on the network. Generally speaking, the use case from AriGuard is managed networks because that that allows the person who's managing the network to say, oh, this is a network where we shouldn't allow this. so nothing special or specific needs to be done. Right. Yeah. I mean, you know, the the thing is if if some if something can get access to your network, and it can see all the packets on your network, which may or may not be the case depending on the layer 2.

Endy proxy isn't very scalable, and it particularly isn't scalable if you have multiple devices that are doing in the proxy. It's it just gets a little ugly.

If there isn't, then it advertises 1. We try to be really careful about not advertising too many of these because we can fill up the thread network data, and we've actually run into situations where we fill up the thread data with us and our prefixes everything stops working.

And so the yeah. Every thread border router has its own ULA prefixes that it's generated So slash 48 is generated with a random number generator it's supposed to be. And So whichever one publishes first, Generally, that's the one that's gonna win. If 2 publish at the same time, We do an election similar to what I talked about for the AAL prefix, and one of them goes away. So This can cause problems because, for example, if a subrover goes away that was publishing the prefix, republishing a prefix, all of the devices on the network now have to renumber. we now wind up with SRP advertisement updates for every single device on the thread network it ain't pretty. Be nice to come up with a solution for that. But right now, we don't have one. so what we're doing right now is just what I described. So just clarifying questions since I don't know if this worked. So if there are 2 subrogers, each have their own thread network. And this election happens. is then the thread radio network collapse into single mesh, and then one of them just gives up and gives up and does nothing anymore. No. The the thread stuff has all happened in kind of at layer 2. So the thread network either is one network with 2 stub routers on it. because remember, it's a mesh. So these stub routers are just elements of the mesh. Okay. they're actually part of the mesh. Right. So so either the network has been joined because it has you know, a shared network identifier and a shared credential. or that hasn't been joined because they have destroyed credentials. Right. Right? And if they have disjoint credentials, then And and so that could either be by design. We actually want 2 thread networks or by accident reform 2 thread networks, but we'd really rather have one. In the second case,"

So that's totally out of scope for the but but in fact, we do have functionality and thread border routers that tries to avoid having 2 thread networks. just for that reason. Okay. And generally, these two thread at the subrogers if I want to have 2 separate networks, do they then on the of of infrastructure network side, like, you know, join up and present on, like, service discovery point of view, do they become one No. Because because you decided you wanted separate thread networks, they're just separate. Related question. Let's say I have a thread network was 1 XPan ID, and then I moved the light bulbs away or closed it or whatever. and they they can't see each other anymore. And carticians. Like, what actually happens. Right? Does that become a different red network? Or -- No. the the credentials remain the same. However, one thing that I hadn't mentioned previously is that it's actually at this point with thread 1.3 relatively unlikely that you would lined up with a partition like that because if they're both connected to the same infrastructure network, we'll just bridge the thread network mesh over Wi Fi. So so the partition event doesn't actually happen in that case. because we do have a way to get packets from between the two partitions. If each partition has a BR. Yes. If on the other hand, there's a partition that doesn't have a BR, well, tough walk. then it doesn't matter. Right? Because you can't yeah. You can't reach Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the case where we would run into trouble is if we have a partition and 1 Doctor is on a different infrastructure link than the other, then we can't field the partition. Maybe you you bridge this on the b r. You've registered the infrastructure link. They're using the same prefix. How how because because you got these 2 stubs is in the same Well, if they're if they're not partition, then it's fine."

Duke's So when you have 2 step rotors on 2 different infrastructure networks, and potentially forming just a single match. Is this a is that right? Did I hear you right? So Yeah. It's it's certainly possible because threat has its own transport. Right? So it's it's entirely possible to have a single thread mesh that has egress more than one infrastructure link. Okay. And in the partition case, if we have route ability between the 2 and discoverability, between the two, then Actually, we can still send the packets over over IP routing. So we can we can We can heal the partition over over a router IP network as well. But that's not gonna be the normal use case in the customer. like in a home Yeah. I'm I'm just thinking apartments ring with things that are close together. So so they don't join automatically because there's you're you have to have credentials. Right? So so if you got two people inter apartment building that that can see each other's thread devices they can't actually join each other's thread networks unless they share credentials. Okay. Thanks. debit on parter. What happens in that exact case when you do share credentials by accident or bite, social stupidity, Like, I have 1 thread network, with 2 completely different 22 completely different apartments. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. and they just happened to use the same credentials because someone didn't understand how this works. and what I have to completely different networks otherwise. is that That could happen in theory.

But, basically, like, matter. Canex. Yeah. Matter Canex. Yeah. is that other infrastructure, building infrastructure, that's very common in Europe. I can't remember. But, anyway, the point is that that these things are essentially responsible for managing credentials. for for the devices that are being managed by them. And so our expectation is that whatever sort of application ecosystem you're using will have some way of doing And so even if your thread networks merge, I mean, thread security model is not exactly super strong. Right? So you've gotta have something at the application layer anyway.

We support it, but only if there only if they have working route. only if only if they're connected to the same infrastructure. So Next slide. discoverability. So We provide if if an AIL host wants to discover a thread host, can use MDNS to do that. and the way the MDNS information is populated is using SRP. So it's an advertising proxy. see the DNS SD working group for details. pretty well. We have noticed some issues looks we wind up with many more devices than you would expect from if you just had a printer and a couple of other things like your home stereo or something, Now we're talking tens or possibly 100 of devices, advertising, that that produces more multicast traffic. So there are issues with that that we've noticed. And we're hoping to move to multi to unicast, but in Ontario. And then if thread hosts wanted to discovery, they can only use unicast because we don't support MD and on thread. So but we do have a router that sorry. a resolver on every thread Portorouter. So you just talk to the resolver. You ask you your question, your DNS SSD questions. and it gives you the answer. either looking in the SRP database or by doing MDNS it's discovering something on the adjacent infrastructure link.

It might be worth looking at those presentations because I actually even if you just read the slides, there's a lot of information about this. But the the basic deal is, 1st of all, you've got multiple border routers acting as advertising proxies. which means that any SRP registration is gonna get advertised by each of them. We limit it to 5 with thread, but that's still a lot of multicast. And now let's say you've got a 100 devices, well, now you're multicasting information about all those devices. when the registrations happen, all of that multicast happens at once. So an SRP server will synchronized with another SRP server and get its database, and it will it will advertise all of the devices in that database using MDS, and that's just a lot of multicast track. So It just depends on how many devices you have, and and we talked a lot about that in the DNS working group with regards to what we could do to mitigate those issues and reduce that traffic to as close to 0 as possible. So we've got some good ideas. And I think So it's a patient problem. Is it the pacing problem or is it the patient problem or not? No. It's it's still quite large. we're doing a lot of useless work, basically. that we could just eliminate entire not really a pacing issue. I mean, there could be some pacing as well. But but mostly, it's just like You know, you don't if you've if you've got 5 routers or 5 SRP servers cooperating to advertise the same information. They don't all need to do multicast probes we transmitted multiple times to to verify that nobody else is using that address. Basically, we need 1 device to probe, And then once that probe is successful, we can assume that there isn't a conflicting record being advertised on FD and S because somebody probed it. and we don't need all all of the other devices to also probe it. And that saves if we don't do that, that saves a huge amount of traffic. Similarly, if somebody does a query,"

So we don't necessarily have an opportunity c the answers, like, Normally, what we expect is an MD and A's answer will get sent. And all of the other things that could have answered will see it and so they won't answer. But with wife the way that WiFi like like like like you know, there are 30s 100 millisecond or multi 100 millisecond gaps. where multicast traffic isn't seen, you might wind up with 3 different devices sending the same answer because they didn't see the other answers because they sent them before that gap ended.

I would really encourage you if you're interested in this to to engage with the DNSSD working group we're actually planning on digging into this problem and solving it. really wanna solve this problem.
