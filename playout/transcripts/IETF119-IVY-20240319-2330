And we've then we followed by a total to present young data model for network inventory. This is our the only one working group item that has been adopted since that IETF meeting and then followed by Nagel and italo to lead the discussion of IV boundary and terminology. So there is was a side meeting about this related discussion happened on Monday this week. And they will present some outcome of this discussion. And then we will have to present a network inventory location model and then followed by the echo to present the asset life cycle management and operations. Finally, we will have team to present a young debt model for energy 7 management Okay. Any agenda version before my culture, tech control, to present the working group status. Alright. Okay.

What is inventory, what do we needed to focus on, etcetera. So you will see in a in in a minute, a a proposal on, how to reduce the scope of, of the core model So it will allow us, to deliver something in on on time not to be used, by, by, by the industry, by the community. We are having, a weekly call we, dedicated that to the inventory core model, every week on, on Wednesday they they have been, interrupted, because of but we will start again immediately after.

And if there was an overlap, No. Not an overlap with whatever work is going on here. Yep. So, basically, I I wouldn't say it overlap, but I would say rather, they are working on something similar. They are happy to Build on top of what we are doing in IETF. They need, to describe, so they are defining an SDN controller for access networks. And that they would like to define to define 2 models. One that exports the topology of the network can manage to buy, the SDM controller. The second one at the tech force the inventory. Of, of the access network So they decided that to investigate on what is available there. The data found the RFC 8345 and, the ID core model. And so they wanted to better understand, What these models does do do Okay. How to use them, how they can extend them. And also understand the what decisions, to cause the air. Something like, for example, why will you I did it to have a 2 separate models for topology inventory and stuff like that. So This is this is the goal of, of the work. Please bear in mind.

To match Mahesh, So I had one question and one comment you define network inventory as collection data for network devices managed by a specific management system. What happens if there is a service level management system That is overlooking multiple domain Management Systems, wouldn't there be a need for a network wide instead of a management wide inventory. Model, sorry. What do you mean, network wide inventory? I think the current data model is a, now a wide, inventory data Okay.

So we would have, but 2 invent remodels exported by the 2 controllers the overarching orchestrator would have to join the two pieces together. So there is that concept of that polarizing model sorry. Management system that is looking at the entire network, not just the individual Okay? Okay. So mean, yeah, what what we can clarify in this text is the fact that the Let let me use, the is terminology. Domain controllers export the inventory that they can see And then, I mean, there must be the possibility to stitch the pieces together. To have the full network, view at the higher to the added layers. That's something good. Yeah. A good the other comment is that the prefix used in the model, and I is actually used by RFC 8529 the network instance model. So, you might have to pick another prefix. Okay. Okay. An ID could be 1. It might be. Okay. Good. Thanks. Next one, Kent. Ken Watson. When I did an inventory model, many moons ago, a couple decades, I think, now.

I I don't think that an inventory model should be able to tell you this network, you can build a 10,000 VPNs or rather than 20,000 it's related though, if it's not you know, directly part of this working group activity, then it's gonna be an adjunct activity to the I mean, we can consider it as an augmentation, for sure, I would keep it out from the core model and would have maybe a dedicated extension dedicated, augmentation. I I would say it falls into into our charter. I would just keep it out from, the the core model also because we are trying to shrink it and to deliver it as soon as possible. And then it can be extended, in many, many ways. Mhmm. Each other, you wanted it to add something, Okay. In my understanding, inventory, the previous inventory has a very, broad or concept everything could be called as inventor in the previous, control and management system.

Probably, it would be a dedicated, a separate, augmentation, but wouldn't call it the apology the fact that, you have given capabilities, or not. Okay. Please Well, yeah. Okay. Italo. I I have to comment, sir. First, on the previous one, from Manesh. I think we can write clarify that this model can be used on your article, architecture so that each domain. Let's see if this domain, and then you can have you can go that up to how much you can get. On this, I think, at this moment, we are using topology to provide the capability. So IT and and we can navigate from the from the inventory to the apology to see So you can say how much VPS annoyed existing node can support because when you start visioning services and tunnels, you need to have this capability information. What I think is hard to do now is to say I need more VPN. So what type of board need to insert is a little bit more complex. What you get in the topology is how many are there How many you can use? Yes. Not how many you can use if you add the this board or if you are at least at the board of That's more more complex. No. But I think it's a very good input.

Sorry. This question is more for you. So when we talk about inventory and and specifications like number of routes isn't isn't Is that something that can be actually specified up front because it's a capability of the system that can change also based on configuration. I wanna use inventory be able to do placement of service And so I want to know is this box capable of doing a latest VPN. If it can, how many can it do How many routes can it support And typically, that's not you know, a number But it might be a range. It depends on various things that are happening. So there's a upper bound and then there's a current capability or current level. So these are what I want from an inventory system. We're building our own, as Kenneth was saying, so If we can use a standard model, we'll be happier. But don't I have to do some reading. So I'll come back but, and that the I was just mentioned but but but Rob Wilson, Cisco, I think we're into the week slightly here because we got to just remember that we're focusing on discussion here is the base inventory model and this is what everything else is building on. So all these abandoned conversations but actually they don't really focus on what we need to solve now. He's trying to keep the base model simple. Then we have everything documented in. And once we start adding those augmentations, have those discussions and try and figure out how they fit in, but keep the base one simple and get it done as fast as we can."

I also called abilities, not features, it was a it'd be a config false node and, you know, buy port, buy line card, etcetera. And it was modeled also how each license would impact that capability. Like, this license has a plus 50. This license has less 100. Or this land card does a plus 10,000. You know, So it actually was, built in that the inventory model would directly lead to an understanding of the capabilities of the box and the max configurations that could be done to it. I also disagree with Rob about trying to do the minimum possible to get it fast out faster. Because I think it's short sighted and you'll likely come out with something that's not gonna meet the actual expectations of operators Well, I I have to say that to hear. I agree with Robert because I mean, building an augmentation on top of that, in, in step 2, I mean, it doesn't doesn't say we are not meeting a customer's expectations. So Someone that stops as step 1 can have the ask me the term, a basic inventory capabilities without features capability and so on and so on and 4th we are not saying that there is not some is something that we want to do. We are just saying first let's deliver something which is a pure simple inventory first and then add on top of that that doesn't mean we are not working on that. Okay. Yeah. I understand, the the desire just look at the topology model. Right? They did something very simple. And now there's like 60 augmentations and spaghetti, so we have to bring up a whole new working group to clean up the mess. Right? That's what's gonna happen here. Hopefully not.

The key message is that if we just augment the couple of key concept from RFC to 345, and we're doing this here It's a pointer.

So, I'm gonna set set some scope scoping definitions to try to help us understand the problem. And then I've gotta pictorial boundary, which I'll go through, which hopefully will get on help.

So, busy slide. Seemed worth breaking the problem space of things down into into a number of, broad categories so, most positive things written in the middle of last month. Not very positive. What's it doing there? Anyway, right. So, the the ignoring the error on the slide, the things you can bring down to physical things that this is what we're on the in the inventory work. Physical things, you can measure them with a ruler sometimes weigh them with scales. That's physical. It's a a real, I think, a real substance. A functional thing, is can't measure it with a relay. You can it's something that does something. It's behavior. It's a separate sort of thing, and and you can, well, as I'll show it later on, the stuff in RSC 245 relates to functional things, the stuff we're looking at physical. We're not looking at functional things and inventories of those. Informational thing, which is a a collection of data can't measure it.

Am I not only resources are things on my assets, the things I do. So examples of things, with the second column, a circuit pack, physical thing that's, a resource potentially an asset. It may not have an asset number on it because it may be some tiny little passive thing. I don't bother putting asset numbers. I have bag, and I just sort of distribute them. Termination point functional thing, resource, not necessarily a formal asset, so I don't stick an asset ID on it. It's more befameral and so on may appear, disappear, maybe emergent a young model, and it is informational. It's text. Clear the resource is not an asset in the same way again. It's gives rise to functionality when installed on a powered visa hardware. So, likewise, software image, very similar. It may have a formal asset number on the the software types who may choose to make that an asset. Or maybe a a smaller component of some asset. And common separated data, that's informational. It clearly doesn't the behavior when you're certain, so I've got some performance that it doesn't change the behavior. So trying to sort of categorize those things.

So then looking at the word inventory. So problem with the word inventory is in English. It just means list of stuff. So, we talked about, and listed any old stuff. So you can have an image of anything. You wanna have an image spoons, etcetera, in a, in a drawer. Sometimes with locations, I might define the place. It's the, the spoons in my drawer. It doesn't tend to give a structure. It's normally just a list of a pile of stuff. Whereas in Ivy, we're looking at structure of physical things. So Although we put the word inventory on, it's slightly different to the the general terms. We need to be very careful to find what we mean by inventory. Not just a list of stuff. It's a list of is a it's a structure of stuff And, It's we're looking at physical things and some some physical things, which John highlighted in a some informational things. There's a boundary. We're clearly not doing inventories of spoons. So this was a physical thing. So, we've got plenty of functional models in IETF and RFC HD 45. So we're not looking at defining models or functional things, fairly, fairly and we're not looking at inventory functional things either. So, listing those or doing structure form, because that's done elsewhere. Now if I try and draw, this is a pictorial thing, you'll you can look in more detail. So the key is obviously too small to read, but I'll try and, help. There's not a lady on this thing. Those aren't my cousin trying to get the microphone and the laser up onto the things, but I won't do that. So there's the in that in that picture, there's a a blue ellipse that represents the traditional term network element. Within that, I've got some physical things, which are the circuit packs. And I've got some informational things, the software. And I've got this power, which is sort of motor force that drives that, solution. And the physical things in the network element are in Ivy scope. The informational things in the network element, Some of them may be in Ivy's scope. May not be, and we need to look at what that means."

So that will be our CHU 4, 5, scope, not the IV scope. Clearly, a relationship between that and the physical thing. So physical thing gives rise to the emergent behavior when powered Likewise, the management control after the, left hand side, that's an emergent thing from the physical environment when powered again, we're not doing an inventory of management control. Items that might be running on the, on the hardware. So hardware, physical things, some informational things not functional things, so not the termination points and not the management control stuff. So the diagram gets more complicated in a moment. But then looking down the bottom, the brown bits, these are physical in this diagram. You've got, fibers, ducks, things of that sort, not in the AV scope. Manhole covers, not in the AV scope, still physical things, but not in the scope. They don't tend to be serial numbers and inventory and so on. So we're looking for that, to sort of help us deboning the boundary. Understanding the geography is important to knowing where the thing is, but not modeling the geography, the geography understanding, locations that are not geographical, again, building locations not modeling the buildings.

Then on the right hand side that I've got, a circuit back in a truck, in a box. We're not modeling that. So in in the process of it being delivered, I may have purchased it. I may have an asset number for hasn't come from the factory yet. It's just being delivered now. On that basis, is not within our scope, we said.

To, to restrict what I wanna do with the particular things as a complicated space in that area that's, we're not modeling. We put capability down with a question mark on, but again, we're gonna resolve that when the and whether we inventory or not as a very complicated model in that area.

If you come back to two pages before with the proposal union and the out of scope, Okay. Yeah. This one. So I'm trying to understand what does it mean by out of scope of IV? Does it mean that based on, we would recommend not to do the augmentation on the IV models. For the for the things on the on the right hand column to not do those things. We won't be doing an inventory of fibers and cables and manhole covers and buildings where we model, the building is an explicit thing. So that was the intention. Yeah. We're not we're not doing the model, so those things explicitly. Okay. And second question is regarding the boundary of the proposal, in scope, I think, it's a we will also manage it step by step And the first step we we we achieve is to create the base model. Do we have a line For example, somewhere in the middle, where the base model should cover. So so we were looking. One place we were drawing a line before was know, we might do physical things first and then informational things second.

And then it the working much it's delivered that, it would re charter. And at that point, it's then saying these things in an after scope. Yeah. So last comment I wanted to make is the the think it's always good with these models if there's there's a level level of flexibility with the with them so that different people are using the models, have that flexibility to they may say actual.

So in not a and that that regard, physical thing, there's I've done a it's I've got a big history in this in in TMF Fund oh, and F, where we we decided the term that we're calling was actually a problem in itself. Because it it isn't really a thing. It's it's a grouping of stuff. And and if if I I was having that discussion this morning, I'll try and make this too long because that that little clock will go red in a moment. But the what we've I think if we go if we go about, like, 40 50 years. Network elements were single shelves with a single management access and a single function. It was all singular. When you move through the history of these things, they become geographical typically dispersed. They have multiple management access. You can see one part through one, one through another. Etcetera, and we decided that that concept was essentially broken. And what you're really looking at is a grouping of stuff that you're interested in.

So what you can see, this is a a typical example in the optical net, or you can see that I have a SSC with optical switch, OTIA's reaching SSC with WLAN switches, some vendors, showed these 2 charters as a sell it as a single network element with huge charters. Other vendors sell this as 2 network elements. So we're single It's event is the same function, the same set of physical elements is a different way you assemble things. So so, basically, It's a very specific assembly, which is putting all these things together. And, Another important address is we said, the this is more quicker when we we compare the physics with the informational is that the asset can be deployed. A physical assets can be deployed. So it means that a a given physical thing is actually deployed over, specific physical thing or another assembly. For example, a plugger, is actually is owned, but is actually deployed inserting into a given slot of the board. The order board is inserted in a given slot of officials see.

So one of the use cases I have in mind is being able to pre provision devices. Like in a network. Especially to support 0 touch. Type environments. Where the device hasn't been deployed yet, but I've modeled The network as if some devices exist, I've even configured services on that network. And so when the equipment shows up, want their services to turn on automatically. So that's 1. And then 2, part of being able to do that is the notion of connectors So if you have inventory equipment, you might have a chassis, which has like pen slops, But, But the, vendor, they might have different versions of pin slots. Like, pin version 1, pin version 2, pin version 3. So there's this whole notion of like, well, I have a I have a line card.

At this moment in time, it's merely capturing what that's that is is some ambiguity. why we are discussing it, That's different people at different opinions is about whether you. It's a purely dolly that was also told to mention it. That that is, we have different cases. It can be purely dolly, a report whatever it's installed, what I I discovered from the network I give you. Or I can have something which is rewrite. For example, there was discussion about, can I put the label over over a existing asset there, but and then I want to configure this label?

I discover it. It's there. I go, right. Harbor's correct. Correct. Correct. Bang the configuration in software in Bryant, but but and I'll figure out That's what you yeah. So that that thing sounds like it could be in scope because the hardware is the same hardware. But what we were saying probably is way out of scope is the abstract I want, you know, the terabytes between those two cities, and I need something there. And there's a, you know, that's where. And and there's a there's a sort of a sliding scale all the way down from that to I think it might be that bit of harm, but I haven't committed it yet, and that's still probably have a scope. But once I commit it, Then it's in, I think that fits with your 0 touch provisioning case. So and and just on the capability of course, they're not speaking. I think, Nigel, maybe we they're they're pretty I think we if the old days, we call it the I'm expecting this expedition. Well, the the there's there's an there's another the device itself. So the device makes maybe there and running, you say, I put that expectation in that slot for that. The device may not be there at all. That's the one you're looking at as the 0 touch when I install. discover I it and go because that's the subtle difference because expect because the device can't know what to it's expected to be good in the position. device for Yeah.

So yearly, this location information, actually, the yearly configured manually, in in SDN controllers or could be managed in the OSS systems. Then the other this is why we think this location from, model is quite necessary And the other, consideration that we have been discussed during the based inventory is, model discussion is how this location model can be modeled like, previously, there are 2, kinds of approaches one is a quite specific one that can be, there can be, racks and rooms.

Is is is this can all be, generalized in this location list. And this location list can also have some, physical address and geolocation information visit So then the location can be, have complete information And then, something another aspect of this location, this is that this location list is not a blacklist. This list can be, can have a hierarchy Co. Structuring it. Such as, site can, can contain several buildings. And a building can have some room, and room can have some raxing it. Next, we have our rec list This is a quite core, model that, if the devices in store this rack based scenarios. In this rec list, model, we, try to probe wide, size, website in the rack.

You mentioned you had an actual, nut yay type, I think it was called rack. Yeah. But sometimes they're called cabinets. And and, you know, you know, so so actually hard coating these value or or labels, I would be cautious of the way I did it was to allow the operator to specify their own hierarchy, location types, made sense to them, And, you know, for instance, silly codes, they can create their own silly codes. And and, And so, anyway, that's my only comment. Just just be cautious of hard coatings with labels. Okay.

And, also, we add reference to the various parameters in the young data model. Try to align the you know, terminology and parameter defining the, you know, energy Managing my friend Walker. And And we try to distinct, you know, energy saving capability from dynamic power and energy some machine parameter, but we model together, in a, in a same model. Actually, we just just before actually, somebody mentioned, inventory know, it's kind of concept So these, you know, something we actually try to model this and, So in case they're very useful, a special use cases. And we also, you know, try to add a correlation with nanotechnology. And so we already set up the gate harbor and to track all the open issue in this draft and, if you are have interested, and feel free to contribute with your common input and, So how the position is not, at it's a saving model. Actually, we have, you know, these kinda, you know, SDING architecture, custom layer, service observation layer, l and a network controller layer. You know, this network controller commander many devices, you know, in, you know, domain. And so it's and the saving model, you know, is used, on not found in the face of Nano controller. So out of the control level, we really can, you know, provide energy consumption visibility in addition, we can, you know, advantage evaluate the energy efficiency So we can, you know, you know, just just just to to to, generate some energy efficient strategy and populated strategy or policy on, the network device In addition, we actually may rely on the nano device, you know, they have some energy saving"

I think we could we could leverage So the the idea is that you're ready, you know, we can, you know, consume less white spots and spam obvious, actually. So to to better, you know, energy efficiency And so this is our, you know, as a saving model design, you can see, we we define the single model energy saving management younger model. Actually extended from 2, your model. Why is network? Inventory based model, the second is network, what was the younger model defined in the upstate, 8345 for the, you know, base model, we expand, you know, with, you know, a bunch of, you know, stationary or static apartment in the week break it on into 2 category, firstly is, you know, energy monitoring capability parameter. So we give the example, for example, energy saving mode And, so these represent, you know, different energy consumption level, Second is energy saving, method. Actually, though, it's kind of heavier to, you know, you know, you know, which lever you reach in it, actually. The second category is energy provision parameter. So these are usually for energy, consumption monitoring, you may sell some boundary for, for the power or for the terminal, for the for the voltage actually. So we, may, may also need to set a boundary for the temperature So we See, this is actually as a provision parameter and offer, you know, these 2 tech category, you know, know, stationary parameter and, integration, we extend it from the nanotechnology young data models to, you know, try try to organize with anemic at the time either."

So these are, you know, general, you know, you know, modeled design, for the detailer, actually, model structure, you can take a look at this and, so you can see the energy saving mode, energy saving messer can be seen as capability, you know, there's a, you know, we actually, be, know, included in both we note, no de lever, add to the, you know, nanotechnology, model, but also, you know, don't know the level, in the, you know, network in inventory under the model. In addition, we actually introduced, like, energy efficiency, ratio, this kind of permit that, And, so we can report this, you know, device level energy efficiency ratio. And, Actually, we also, you know, know, you know, you know, and, you know, see, try to, you know, establish relationship between the energy saving mode and energy saving method. And, also for power state, actually, we model this actually, in the, you know, component never and, perhaps they can be broken out into, you know, for 4th data, 4th data, without off state, sleep state and, how, and the, low power state and, our saving, in April state, And the here, Jess, you know, give you a sense, you know, for how do you, you know, clarify this energy saving method, actually. So we can see, actually, we have 3, energy saving mode. We basic mode. Standard mode and deeper mode for for and it's saving base mode. Actually, you can support, you know, multiple energy saving method, whether I'm on use the high speed, the know, for his shutdown. Usually, can be used in the, place between to, you know, adjacent component for it on between the"

And, for the unused, boulder, shut down this more focus on system level so we can use can, you know, apply to the, you know, some kind of, you know, switch your bladder for it and, you know, And, Also, you know, for standard motor, you know, we give power module execute on prod. We can you know, break down the power modem into several section. Each section has a multiple power modules. So we can make some of these power modules leap make a sum of the power module, you know, awake actually. And for, And you're saving deeper mode, actually, we give example, you know, we kind of have, you know, switch it play the, border, you know, in between, like, SFU and SFU. 2, actually, we can make a SFU, like, this kind of board to be, you know, awake, you know, connect to all the 9, line board and for another you know, switching play the ball, you know, to be, you know, sleep, sleep, And, so we all also support these unused channel shutdown, you know, this you already can set up a several channel between the know, port and the chip. And so can make, you know, some channel, you know, you know, sleeper and, Domin Omenon and make someone, awake. So just to give you a sense of this, how any saving, method look like how they can be used in in within the network device. Last night, just a bit of a bit. I'm gonna tie the network energy savings so we know this actually has already been documented TVR use case, draft, actually, you know, you can see the specific section. So this generate, you know, you can see that the traffic, you know, follows specific pattern they can, you know, rise or or or for, you know, at a specific time point, for example, they may, you know, rise, you know, at a, 10 o'clock or or 4"

So they, have some kind of, you know, board, a switcher, playboarder, they can, you know, try to adapt to this kind of traffic change, actually. So so where you can actually make a you know, some, you know, within this network, animals, you know, make a, you know, what Akadis is the 1 you know, for, you know, to to be entered into the sleepers, mode, actually, When when there's some, you know, reaching update, or there's some alarm to be, trigger, actually. So this, you know, this border may be and, you know, need to week is this kind of board and to make sure whether this event really affect the, you know, any saving status. If that's the effect that we can make it sleepy again. And if, you know, you know, it it it it that that's the effect. Actually, the way it can make it, you know, fall back to the initial state. But we actually allow some, you know, transaction stage, you know, allows some delay from the initial stage the, transition status so we can try to avoid, you know, frequent, a high frequency, you know, concurrent this kind of failure or this, or we're gonna call this as a, you know, and it's saving status of fly pin. So that's a, general idea of how these can be used in this kind of specific use case, but we imagine actually there are more use cases. And, this, you know, typical maybe in a campus network, maybe in a random networker, and you know, I think other letter was the if they, you know, follow this kind of title network pattern, actually. So that's all, for the whole concept and the and Yeah. And so here, comments in both questions. Yeah. So I have a I have a question the the How uh-uh. It's not clear to me how does this draft, relate, with the tonnies."

    "text": "Yeah. That's good question. I really was saying we should sync up with Tony's job that I think he already presented in many working group and, I I don't know how we can you know, work together on this because we have, you know, you know, seminar go try to actually have the same prompt space, but we may have a a little bit different, you know, you know, a solution proposal. And, so definitely we need to get together with his car. Yeah. Okay. And the the sec the second question is Mahesh, which is already at the mic. to Which is we we know that there is an ongoing activity dedicated to green networks, sustainability, etcetera. So How the how should we be able? Should we consider, only the work that is repeatedly related to inventory. Should we refrain it to do any work, on, green networking so an ability, etcetera? Yeah. So that's what I came up to the mic. So Robin and I have discussed this And there is, what group forming buffs that we are targeting for 120. For anything that is green initiative So at this point, I would suggest I don't wanna speak for her, but, I think the plan is for work like this. It'd be deferred and wait wait for that work group to be formed. And, certainly, this is not in scope for IV. Okay. But also also, staff, which is purely inventory related, then I'm thinking example, I don't know, the power consumption of a given device. That is something that is inventor in the end. So Do you expect the new working group to augment the, the inventory core model when it comes to inventory related stuff, or, or not. It would be completed a couple from what you're so the green initiative, if our, at least looking at"

But it's going to be more mostly around power management and what power efficiency. So in that sense, Is it an augmentation? Of the inventory model, that's a question. That the work group can try to and figure it out. I don't have an opinion. Okay. So you you still have a a of days to skip the line. I use them. One day. Few hours. Yeah, so to back up what Mahesh was saying, and it's not my it won't be my be yours to deal with effectively soon. So the aim there of of of why I was trying to suggest doing, a bot, actually getting several working group is try and get the sort of power management rated stuff, but the stats off and also any sort of control standardize quite quickly because the the sooner we can sort of make change in this area, the more chance that we can actually have some meaningful change to energy consumption. And so as to where the work happens, I think that that for charter discussion would be a good place to decide that. I think it would be best for the work to happen probably within that new working group if it gets formed. With liaisons or discussions about not liaisons, but discussions back to these working groups like Ivy and they got surgery wherever, but having one home for this stuff, I think, would help have a focus group for that work. Net So if, I mean, if you are working on the on the chart, And if you could somewhere specify that everything that inventory related, that should be, on top of, inventory model rather than being something that is completely decoupled, the probability that would be I don't know if it's possible from a process point of view. Yes. I think you can roll it if you like in a charter, but I haven't started writing Charter. Yes. It's not sure. It's gonna be me right at the charter. So just wait that clear. Kent? Yeah, Kent."

    "text": "Was also wondering about the applicability, but, actually, what I really wanna say is I I have a soft spot for this. I'm really happy to hear that there's a working group that might be spinning up, to do it, 20 years ago, I filed a patent was awarded a patent for power based routing And the whole idea was like, certain data centers have solar panels, you know, it's a sunny day. They have a wind farm, and it's a windy day. So you can actually calculate the route would actually have a lease or, I guess, the most renewable energy. Me, that actually seems more important than worrying about the power of, like, a specific device because if the entire data center is powered by renewable energy, that's actually more impactful. And helpful to the environment. But again, for a different working group or buffs, Yeah. But I I I agree with you. Well, actually, that's more, power metric, I would say, the something that you use, in routing. One thing that To me, it fits more, into the inventory space is, for example, not just how much power, a given device is consuming, but where that power comes from. For example, you might have a device, that consumes, very little energy that comes from, an high polluting, a source or some something else so that the consumer a little bit more, but it's completely renewable energy. So that in my opinion is inventory. What you were speaking about, it's more a routing. Actually, I have a quick question to our AD, you know, since, you know, we targeting from the working group. Do you think it'll make sense to create the maintenance for this to have dedicated this customer where I wish you'd discuss, for this kind of topic. Okay."

Requesting my name is yes. My name is. Yes. That will happen. Yeah. Okay. That And, we have Marisol in the queue. Yeah. You know, we are out of time. Right? I I mentioned in the chat There is a site meeting tomorrow on power metrics and we would like to, and Discuss as well next steps with all the graphs that are around Power Metrics I believe they said a big and End of this draft with Tony's as well as the power that the myself Other authors has yet there. And, there is in the that we are going to present tomorrow, Daniel your question, we are considering the inventory based model, we are building on top of 10 because we got consider the concept of I do not go to see if it's physical or virtual. From from that aspect but we are considering the inventory, the IV a work, right, that we are putting here in the base model. Okay. So we we are successfully late once again. Thank you, everyone.
