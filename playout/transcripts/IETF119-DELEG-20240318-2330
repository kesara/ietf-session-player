We're gonna dive to sort of what are the reasons behind why this BAF is being formed in the first place? There is an active existing Draft, DNS up, Deleg, And, there's gonna be a short presentation of where that work is remind everybody that that is not yet the agreed upon body of work. It is just the the one proposal that exists out there. And then there's gonna be, we'll have a discussion. The better methods DNS delegation is really more about, an opportunity for everybody to talk and see if we're on the same page for for a path forward. And then we do have some sample charter tech that Paul and I put together, that that has had some discussion on the mailing list. And that's really where we would like you know, the active discussion for exact wording that we wanna hand this to the ASG, assuming that we have a working group, can, propose Avenue going forward. So just a note on the agenda. The 30 minutes for reasons we have some presentations for that. That's not a discussion part. If if there are technical clarifications at the end of that fine, we'll we'll hold them all to the end. The 20 minutes on better methods That is that's that's explicitly open mic. So again, The first one is we've got some presentations. We don't want discussion other than Clarif occasions The second one Absolutely. That's where where we'll have discussion. Thank you, Paul.

I work for Ican, I thought to put some thoughts together on I think are the limitations of current and are legacy delegations, And then I'll have some additional thoughts as well. So where we are with, the current delegation issues. There is really no method to shake up capabilities. Right? We want to schedule something like secure transport. Or error reporting or what have you. You currently cannot do that. U, u, Basically, the only thing you have is an as a record, and some blue records. One is a string and the other one is an address. You can't really encode information in there. Another issue is the operating dependency on the register and register our registry chain. The issue there is if, for instance, you want to change your DS record and hopefully you do that regularly when you added the s. And then when you remove the old s, you basically have to go to often a clueless, registrants talking to a ignorant registrar and then an overzealous registry, and That is not useful. So is there another way of doing this? And I think there is another another issue is that NSA glue rackets are not signed in the parent zone. They may be signed elsewhere, they can only be verified after the delegated jail zone is contacted. Right? You wanna verify before you contact. Otherwise, he just leaked stuff to an adversary in the in the worst case. Another issue I've seen is parent and child inconsistent see. Now initially, I thought this is actually a minor thing, but if you look it. And if you talk to some operators into security folk, it's actually a big problem. There's a current lack of standard language around this. I understand that DNS operation folks are working on this. But, yeah, result from maybe a child or parent centric"

And these are my thoughts only just committed to, to a slide. So it it Feel free to ignore them, but, hopefully, they are useful. So you really want to facilitate name share for capability What does the same name share you're capable of? What transport does support, what encoding does it do, etcetera, etcetera. We also want to add another layer of indirection. Right, right, right, and If you think back on the old DNS check, the very old DNS check, where you had where you had sick at parents. And we had sick a child, and then someone came up with DS records. That's another another layer of indirection. We want to do the same thing for operations. Right? And you can basically do this independent. You can basically do independent operations. Independent of the parent or independent of the registrar registry registran And we also want to have name server authentication verified before use. And the last thing is we wanna do this watch and, hopefully, And I'm not just talking about inventing Delek, If we if if Delek is for one reason or another failure, and we have to do it again. We don't want the netter 3, 4 years. This was pushed upon me. I was made very aware of this by him. By Paul Walters. Who had a good idea around this and also, benchmarks. We'll also have a good idea around this. And I'll go into that in a minute. Next, please. Requirements, it's something that get that that it has to be built in, so this is a bit of scaffolding.

So an authoritative server must somehow include an authenticated denial to prove absence of This new record on his new set of records. A resolveers must expect the expected. Be certificate in denial.

D s has been proposed DNS key flag has been proposed, with a DNS key flag or a DNS can indicate that a result from must expect and check or and check 3 rate.

Now, luckily, shimmel, the night found that basically, all major implementations, they ignore unknown records. And keep in mind, Delek records to legacy withdraw for that, no, And they ignored DNS T Flex as well as DS types, the background now. Alright.

We'd I just gotta You're you're fairly Oh, I'm sorry. quiet. Alright. I'll speak louder. I'll wake up the kids. How's that? Alright. Another thing that that we do we wanna avoid the inconsistency between parent and childliness But Now with a new delegation method, we actually increase inconsistent see if we're not doing this in the right way. All of these things can mismatch. And lastly, and I think this is important, especially for the security folks. This DS aliasing, right, the idea that you can, outsource DSU record management to an operator. This requires a breach of trust. Not just the train of the chain of trust, and I apologize for the bad naming. That implies that there needs to be a chain of trust between the thrust anchor. And the parents the dusty aliasing, and also a chain of trust between the trust anchor and the alias itself. So, it's naive to say that if you're under an unsigned level domain, that Delek can bring you something signed. It can't. It doesn't work that way. Security doesn't work that way. You can't upgrade. You can only manage where you can't upgrade from unsecure to secure. So this needs strong wording in whatever document is gonna come out of this Alright. That's it for me. Back to you guys.

No days, we have crypted protocols, such as dot I'm DOQ, DOH, DOH3, and probably other ones in the future. And we have support, in the recursive and the strategic name servers.

It's either in shaking and agreeing on, you know, this is my cert and you can come to me and talk Eventually, the Priya came with the, opportunistic probing neutures they're all encrypted DNS.

And that can over time evolve without needing to go back through the whole chain. Involving the DNS pipeline. Next, please. And another thing that I think would be important, there's mitigate your opinion on that. But at the moment, whatever set in the parent is gone live. It's going to take TTL time for time to pick it up. If you made a mistake, it will take TTL time for them to get your revert. And as much as we standard name servers, without Considering secure for the code, it's fine. Recordsive name servers are doing a good job at pulling back onto other name servers. It comes to enabling a Secure protocol, typically, you don't really want them to downgrade, right? So we've all heard of stories of enabling sec and things not going as, they should be. It would be the same for encrypted protocols. So It would be nice to provide some kind of experimental support. Just like Hayspf, as in the past provided the premises support Like, you could start naming the record. Permissive mode that allows you to gather data, understand is your operation going?

    "text": "Ben. Hello. Alright. Next slide. So, I just wanna focus on one specific reason that I am particularly excited about Delegg, and that is that right now, for encrypted, DNS. A dot. We sometimes call it authoritative DNS over TLS The only actual specification we've agreed on is 9539 essentially unilateral probing, and this provides opportunistic security. Which I am supportive of. It's a good start. But opportunistic security is is actually an incentive for the attackers to deploy downgrade attacks. And to deploy them as widely as possible. And the downgrade attacks here are totally trivial to deploy. So yes. We've we've, like, created a cool test bed. That's good. But we've also set ourselves up for a failure, we basically told we've we've painted a we we've put on a t shirt that says, kick me. So I think we really need to do better. And to do better, we need downgrade resistance so that if you try to deploy that downgrade attack, what you get in is an outage and a, and a, a 1,000,000 complaining users instead of you know, silently gaming access to be able to view and maybe modify everybody's and that's trust And we need that downgrade resistance to really be widely what, what, what, if it's just a few weird resolvers that go in for some extra special mode where you get downgrade resistance then this is not gonna help. Those few users are just gonna get an outage when somebody wants to deploy a downgrade attack. So, we really, in my view, need widely deployed downgrade And the only way that can happen is if it can be deployed without slowing down normal resolution. We are not going I think, I think, spell it, be able to get to a world where every resolver in the world is willing to pay a 1 RTT penalty on all resolution"

That we need some more, we need a Richard delegation capability, and that's Dellig. So my, yeah, my dream scenario for this is that if you're a, you know, a small local ISP and you download software package for 1 of the major popular resolver implementations and you turn it on, It is downgrade resistant by default. It understands Delag, it sees the right information to say, you know, we're an authoritative services. I really support DOT, and you should use it if you can.

But, the demark, specification doesn't allow the public suffix of a name to do that because the way the lookup works is that it's looked up before the public suffix label before. So, It currently can't be done, and this would be one application. And there's probably others. So this is, like, not a demark specific problem. Then, the parent might also want to, declare the inverse. That they don't govern policy for their children. For example, when they are a public suffix, like, I don't know, s3.masinaws dotcom, and they want to say, We don't control each of our children, and we don't want whatever cookie scope to be shared across them or something. That's what the public suffix list, currently addresses, and it kinda works fine ish And it's a lot of work for those volunteers, but in particular, it's also out of band. It's not really a DNS, innate, way of expressing this. And then if the parent doesn't express That's if the parent doesn't say my child's independent, but the child actually is then the child might want to declare that some way, and there currently is also no way to do that. So for example, if s3.msandaws.com, which is a public suffix, not on the public suffix list because m as in, for example, didn't care, then it would be nice if the registered name under it could still care I don't want to share cookies with any other, sibling domain names. So, all these different kinds of boundaries might or might coincide with DNS delegations, So for example, umc0.uk a zone cut under.uk So this two zones, actually, but it's not an organizational, demand boundary. It's only a technical one, and the inverse can also happen as a mentioned earlier, the Amazon example, they actually have a bunch of, customer domains under their public suffix, but they are not"

And there's probably lots other examples. I just try to give, an overview of different types of them. And, so that's the problem space that the debound effort, tried to address. Next slide. So the question is whether better boundaries can be, achieved with better delegations. And if we are talking, you know, dialogue and whatever. So let's see how we can get this. So one interesting, approach for the declarations that the parent makes would be if there could be policy only delegation So essentially, without pointing at a name server or without any glue, just the key value pairs that the SVCB records allows and then make the name server stuff optional. So you could have a Delek record at a non zone cut, saying policy equals sovereign or policy equals enforce demark or whatever. And that could, express that stuff. I'm not saying that's how it should be done. I'm just saying that delegation conceptually is not necessarily a name server delegation. And if we consider, the names of our stuff to be just key value attributes, like the DOT stuff or the glue stuff or the DS stuff or whatever else we put in there, we might wanna put in policy and allow them to be combined with other key value stuff, but not necessarily have to. This would be delegations that don't create a zone cut and don't create a new child Apex. Probably there's lots of weird stuff when you think that through. But, I think we should think it through. And then, for the stuff that the child declares, I think well, I don't know how to solve that. But it's, part of the problem space. And so one could, for example, think that if the Delek record parameters are somehow populated through the child and then parent does some processing, like, I don't know, seasoning type of thing or whatever it will do.

Right now, I just wanna turn on the timer. Thanks. Speaking. There we go. So many of you in the room may not have seen, what we're proposing, as a means of updating delegations. And so this is why this quick review is right here. In the simplest form, it basically just mimics in a mass record, except it has the ability to sign and include the glue records right in the delegation itself. But then there's also this proposed, what's currently called the alias mode based on service bindings use of the term. And it's very much looks like a service binding record in the deli you specify a flag 0 that says, oh, to find out how you should be resolving this domain, go ahead and, look up this other name where you will find a service binding record you the parameters that you need"

Well, so just, again, in this particular example with the the alias mode, Delhi points to a name that you look up and in that. It has a number of service binding parameters in the simplest form. That is where you would get the address glue that you might need to contact servers and so on. So our motivations have already been pretty well covered by a lot of, like what, Roy and the other percent said initially as far as, we wanted to 1st secure the Actually, I'm gonna jump to the end because this whole thing that happened at drug, even though I was kinda warned away from talking about this, basically, petter, came up with, you know, wanted to discuss at prog hackathon, how can we possibly work on some of the big problems in the DNS. What are you unhappy with the DNS? What do you wanna work on solving? And our discussion kind of quickly coalesced around the ability of we'd want to kind of at the baseline. Be able to say, hey. The server you're talking to, without having to probe it, you will know that it a new, you know, you're not expecting it to necessarily be 198060 in this. You're gonna be talking to a modern name server that understands a lot of the current expectations of what a named server should do. And so one of the ways to quickly materialize out of that was well, if we had a the delegation actually told us that it wouldn't require additional probing or additional look to find out whether that was true. The limitation is pointed out by Roy of having CNS record is all you have as a name and the only expectation you have point is that you're gonna be able to talk to it on port 53? You, I UDP port 53. You can't even count on it talking TCP to you. And so we wanted to that indicates ways you can do and possibly even then provide an, off ramp. To, on"

There are some people that, do, accept, kind of object philosophically to using this as a way to leverage into DNS V2, because to their particular worldview, then it isn't even DNS anymore. So We'll call that instead the domain system. We'll just call it the next system. In German. And we'll also call DNS and this provides an offer into that, a new way, possibly using protocol name space. Because one of the other goals that we came up with was we needed a way to not be that disruptive to existing software. We needed that way to not be that disruptive to existing business models. That exist among domainers and various ICANN constituencies and so on. And to not be that disruptive to registries. And so the thought was If we had a new record type, that becomes parent side only, there's gonna be some work that has to be done, by people, you know, all layers of software, resolvers, authorities, registries in order to accommodate this. If we could get it done once, then we could leverage that to a number of different goals throughout the process. And so one of them was to secure the delegation. Right now, While it is true that you can, your delegation is still secured. It's a it's an after the fact check. Since the honest records aren't signed, the glue records aren't signed. You get to, Oh, did I just misstate that group records are not signed. Right. But in any event, the, you, you can end up in a situation where you mister queries to another server. Now they won't validate after that, but you are still informing a rogue name server possibly of what your query intention is. So we want to secure all of that information at the parent's side to say,"

We have operators and registries of all sitting in on this roundtable discussing the possibilities. One of the things is, like, we could use this to actually leverage the difficulties operators currently have, and we've tried to solve through other methods like CVS and CD and SKey and Csync to, update DNS SEC information from the child to the parent. This was another way to kind of take out the need of having, registrants have to update their registrar to push data to the registry anytime they want to change record, for example, because we would be able to say, this operator is gonna hand all that. And we can establish a chain of trust through going through the operator. And as many of you have known, we have, created multiple proposed tools in the IETF about other transport, underlying transport mechanisms for doing DNS. DNS over TLS, DNS over quick, DNS over https. All of those, if you want to reach them right now, you have to have external knowledge, out of band knowledge, far as how to reach those authoritative name servers, or the case of your resolver, but we're thinking of the authoritative case here. And this also seemed to be a great message at a great method to advertise the capability of a name server and says, Oh, well, you can talk to us on UDP 53 over here, but If you want upgraded security, you can also talk to us on quick over here and I already adjust the extensibility place piece. That really was a main motivator for us because we're not just trying to sign solve the problems of securing the delegation or directing to We actually see a future where this addresses a number of other problems while doing the groundwork of getting the registries and the authorities and the resolvers all update at once and then being able to leverage that from the future.

As I mentioned, we had a number of people that were present at the hackathon, and then we socialize to later saying, hey, this is what we're thinking of doing. We had resolvers and authoritative server implementers in the room, and they were encouraged by it. There are a number of registries that were also present for the discussions and we're like, yeah. I could see this working. And then, of course, operators definitely like, you know, like Akamai and cloudflare, like the possibility that they would be able to ease some of their operations management And, at the most recent DNS of work, I I will qualify this remark to say Paul Machapetris did not give a full throated endorsement of yes due Delig the way you should do Delig, but he did get off after my presentation there and, and basically, comment that when he originally came up with the DNS, he imagined it as being a series of different modules that were all on little 3 by 5 cards. And over time, you'd be able to replace, you know, one of these 3 by 5 cards with a new way of doing things. And one of those cards was delegations. So he is is supportive of the general idea of being able to work on delegations, not being stuck with the way he came up with it in the 19 eighties, But nonetheless, I will be clear. He has not specifically said, yes. You guys should do public. But I found it encouraging nonetheless that he was still supportive of all of us working on some new form of delegation, whatever it may be. And then, also, Roy and Shooman did a fair bit of testing our initial assumption, which was that Well, if we put a new record in along with NS and DS records, would resolvers be able to continue And, also, if we started putting in some of the ideas we had for securing that delegation, for example, not allowing downgrade attack to say, oh, there's no deli in this domain, even though there was, would we be able to secure that through a little bit of additional finagling DNS segment of data. And the answer to both of those questions was, very positive"

To, you know, can you just can you use the new information data, and that's really straightforward, and that's been positive too. I think actually William has done some of that in not for example, correct? No. We'll do a survey of just what that is expect, you know, we're going to plan on having a draft 1, probably, does depend a little bit on the outcome of this buff, but the authors are so encouraged to keep working on this. And, we will start a software implementation survey of, you know, who's done what and where it might be able to work. There are a number of open issues, though. We don't you know, pretend that it's baked, as has come up with the 1st draft is, did the draft itself need some, more clarity and, better flow for explaining how things work. Then there are some additional questions like, well, you know, one of our intentions is to, secure itself, but if you have a deli record that is not secured with DNS, then what should the behavior be? You know, for example, if you are getting transport delink that says, oh, I want you to speak, DNS over TLS with this TLSA information to this name server. Well, if it's not secured with DNS, sec, you probably shouldn't touch trust it. Right? And none of that has really been specified yet. We also have a question about, you know, could there be a signal that happens in the query from the resolve that indicates, hey, I'm delegate aware. So maybe only send me delegate information, for example, keep my package size smaller. So there are some questions like that."

And we do have some ideas about that and wanna them was as Peter had, you know, like, you could do something like deep down you're trying to specify an attribute of, you know, something below the zone cut And, right now, there's nothing really supporting that in the draft. But there is this idea of, well, you could specify, a target name of dot, for example, which would, say, oh, this isn't really about a name server you're supposed to talk to. This is, you know, indicating after of the delegation. And, Then, of course, we also have, should, it's come up on the mailing list, you know, should other attributes of the alias mode delegate, this one where you redirect, to an operator. A third party operator. Should attributes be able to go on that. Right? Like, one of the goals originally in coming up with idea of having this operator mode was that, you would just specified. The target name and everything you needed was at their end so that you are not relying on the customer update their their delegation data, with their registry. So the if you add other information into that, you are kind of subverting the attention there. We and we have to work out, well, is that really an important thing to wanna do at these attribute into also the alias mode. Are there some that may be do make sense there or not. It's a it's it it hasn't been investigated very fully, so that's what makes an open issue. And, There are also some open questions. For example, one thing that I know that William did was he added a flag to signing that will auto generate NS records from your deli"

I want to point them to this set of name servers and ones that understand delegate. I want them to a different set of name They can be, you know, they can be the same, but they could be different. And so one of the questions that has come up is, well, okay, what should you do, resolvers have traditionally been very greedy and trying to get an answer by whatever means they can. So if deli failed, maybe they'd wanna fall back to NS, but we should provide some guidance on that because one of the things that many of you seen recently is that as, some types of attacks, resource consumption attacks have sprung up. There have been ways to essentially, you know, shut down, operations on a name server by having it chase a lot of work that it never really gets resolved. And maybe one of those is, oh, I'm gonna give you a bunch of doublet records to try before you go to NS or something. And then so a fair question is, you know, do we need some idea of how we limit work through this? And, of course, As many of you have already brought up, both in the in the chat and on the mailing list. You all have your own ideas about why this is a bad idea. This particular approach. And so, you know, there there could be other open issues, that I have not listed here, that point to, you know, perhaps not even taking a double based approach.

Does anybody have, you know, I'll remind everybody that we have yet to actually get to the point of selecting the proposed approach. So there's one that's in very heavy, development, but there's a more, you know, potentially coming in the future. We'll work about that when the working group's actually formed. So with that, Paul Luther's start with you. Okay. I have a question. I sit down? Yeah. You can sit down at first. Jumped the queue to ask that question. Yeah. Okay. Part. So okay. Sorry. So I'll I'll try to raise a few few brief points. I think the the the problem space is mostly that the DNS host that cannot update records like the NSN and DS record And that is quite separate from, all the zone properties you wanna relay. If the name if the DNSO could actually update these records, then, we we would have less of a problem. And so the alias mode is really good thing where we can sort of redirect it and move that to the the DNSOs so that they can update it. But if you if you have that, then you have actually most of the solution. Because if you split the names here for properties from the zone properties. A lot of problems that they like tries to solve fall fall away. If you assume that the name server zones contain no secrets, you have, like, a a name server, let let's call them, like, you know, big company dash name server.com. There's nothing secret in the accept name server names. You don't have to worry about the initial bootstrap and all this in baileywick things of problems, and you're you're leaking the, the target DNS name. Because you're only leaking name, server names. And that's not really a big problem because there are, there are big hoses where you do this, where you sort get your privacy back. So, and the additional problem is that If you allow name serve for information, like, which certificates to use or other properties of which transports are available if you put that in the zone,"

I do think that we need to Try to narrow some of the solution space trying to do DNS over every protocol and every transport I don't think is long term sustainable, especially when there's gonna be continuing advances in things like cipher suites and other types of technologies and how you communicate what you support. We've already seen that be you know, an issue and a number of different either software and how you can configure it and such. And so we're gonna have to be very careful in how anything is rolled out, to ensure some amount some level of backwards compatibility.

I think this is a very good idea, and it's certainly something holds within the ITS streamer and probably are working to be as needed I am concerned though about various aspects of what's being discussed here that some of the use cases don't appears to be all that clearly defined at the moment. Fair enough for an early stage of things. But the fact that we've got people here that may have different expectations of what daylight can and can or can actually solve and I think if we do get a working group forms, these issues may either be clashing with each other or they're good competing priorities, and that will be a difficult thing for whoever's going to cheer the working group to try and manage it or at least control in some ways. Some people seem to think it's going to about for discovery for new transport for the international people talk about improving key changes and key signatures, not the rest of it. Talk about an extensible mechanism and extensible mechanism of what that always gives me the HEB GB So I think we have to be very careful about this and how specify the work going forward and try to prioritize it.

And I'm not trying to criticize here, but it's registrars. I mean, if we're going to get this idea adopted, are we going to get the input from registers about whether they think it's either a good idea or a bad idea or if it would be needed to implement it, and I was talking to a few folk killed about this.

So benchmarks that I just heard Paul Waters mentioned the idea that this data should live with the zone. And that And we've had some discussion about whether that could be done by placing these records entirely inside the name server name zone instead of trying to hoist any of this information up into the parent. And and My my view on that is that I don't think we I don't think we can expect that that is possible without performancedegradation and I don't think, that we can reach Universal Deployment, If there is any performance degradation, So that's why I think Delegg is needed here, and we we cannot achieve the same effect by for example, putting service binding records under the named server name, which is how it you know, a a year ago, I probably thought that this would all shake out. To Jared's point about being very careful about how we move forward because of the complexity here, Actually disagree. I actually think that's that's backwards.

And if you want operator control, then you're doing out of bailiwick, delegation, you do a glue list delegation, and all that's left is the And if you don't wanna deal with, like, multiple NS records, there's no actual need to to like, you can have one MS record with a bunch of IP addresses on it. That's like, the protocol goes completely fine. So the only thing that's act like this The only information that's being described here is actually the DNS SECating information.

Yeah, Ray Bellis. I see. Actually a similar comment. I mean, my reading of this is is kind of ambiguous because it says the first use case is delegation information. Says the second use case is encryption, And then it says the working group will only do delegation. So which is it? When when 2 different people write a paragraph, what you end up with. So but let let me let me clarify. The paragraph afterwards is about extensions to the DNS protocol. The the the first sentence of The paragraph says first use case for this DNS allegation. Is expected to be delegation aliasing, not delegation. So aliasing is is the important word there. So the as it stands is first use cases, aliasing, the second use case, is encrypted transport. Warren has asked for those to be 2 together. But They both relate to delegation. I think that still needs some wordsmithing because that's really unclear. Perfect.

You know, you don't have to imply a priority. To the things. And, but then you can imply a priority by saying, Hey, the the dot, a doc, though, art is maybe slightly more interesting to the IETF as a whole.

And then the other thing I want just address was, and this might be surprising as one of the authors. Of Delic, but, I think that taking future extensibility into account is a little viguous and for the topic of a working group, I would say, and consider the possibility of future extensibility. Right? Like, the way it is there, you could infer that it's suggesting that we have to somehow build extensibility into it, and I don't think that's actually the case. It's what I want. Bye. For the working group charter, I think, just considering the possibility of extensibility is sufficient. Great. Thanks. Thanks. Eric. Eric Rank, Cisco, and indeed, my other side regarding again this 4th paragraph, I would move it 1 paragraph above. Right? Because the use case are linked to requirements and not related to the specification, a minor theft. Not sure whether we can only specified delegation aliasing is a hint to specific implementation. But the more important stuff, I think, we need to be sure that we can work with then the tenant for the sequence. Requirements to specification as he must meet me when it made stronger."

I don't think that's a good thing to do in this particular scenario. And I didn't worry too much about where the documents have to be published as RFCs or not. Obviously, I think the better as RFCs but maybe all we need to call out is the ones that have to or should be standards track. The others could be issued as informations or whatever, but I don't think we have to get involved in the nitty gritty of that. Just tell them, say that they're working to is expected to abuse a whole bunch of documents, a, b, c, and d And if there's one that's a specific need that has to become a standard track, then call back one out specifically. Other point I wanted to make was actually something made in the chat earlier about consideration of the sequences. I think that's something that should be part of the overall charter here.

And with that being time for safe having another boss, in Vancouver, are we looking further out? We don't know. We don't know. And and even once we're done with the charter, we don't know how long it's gonna take for the IS g to do it. The good news is because we have so many people in and the ISG is going to know that. They will probably keep us informed on, for example, scheduling for Vancouver, or possibly even before. I mean, Here, I'll I'll do a wild one of we finished the charter in 2 weeks from now and and again, this I'm being silly here. We finished the charter in 2 weeks from now, We do a 2 week last call send it the ISG, and a week later, they come back and say, you're a working group. We could, in fact, have you know, a an interim or whatever. And I'm saying that because we just don't know, like, how this will all happen. I'm going to trust the ISG to, show good effort on this. Not because they always show good effort, but when, you know I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I I didn't hear We we are calling them used by your trust Okay. I have noticed in the past when there's a lot of people did on a topic and have said they're gonna do work we get a better result from them."

So somebody's gonna say something somebody more important than Wes and I is gonna say something on the mailing list after we have sent the charter off to the ISG. Thanks, Paul. I've just stated to our beloved area director, so it'd be nice if you give us an indication as they thought the likely type may be maybe They don't know when we're gonna get them a charter We, you know, Maybe We still have a bunch of work to do on the list in the coming weeks. 1. Yeah. I mean, a fair bit of the next time it depends on how quickly people get to a charter, how clear everybody agrees on the charter. I mean, looking around, I think, generally, this seems to have been relatively successful. At all. Fun part will be the food fight over who gets to own this One thing which I might do, which is somewhat unusual, is I might be sending out email to the list something asking for who is willing to share it. Would be useful to have like a lodge sort of swath of people who we could consider from, might choose from a different group But, you know, would be useful to also have some newcomers, etcetera, who haven't shared before, he interested in fuel. New York can speak for both of us. So before you sit down, Warren, we are pretty much at the end of the the session to a large extent? Is there anything else that the AD is either any of the ADs in the room would like us to, discuss today before we close. Nope. I was gonna suggest we go through the list of questions and how to run successful buff, but Eric Kindly, you know, stood up and did that. And I think we have At least vague answers to most of them, the sort of scope, Oh, dear. He's behind me. I should sit down. No, Eric. You you can stand up. Just one thing. You were quite optimistic if you say IAG in 1 week. It will mostly take 2 +2 weeks. Right? We are running by format cycle. But I don't see any objection on this. Honestly, it would be"

I'll abuse But not in this room, but it anyway. I just wanna say, like, On the list and both in person at the previous IETF. The emotions were super high, and people were like really emotional, really, you know, strong opinions. Today, this session was was was was was fantastic. Like, there was everybody was so civilized, like, applaud for us It's really good. Right? Thank you. to All the credit goes Paul for that. Yeah. Right. Maria, Yeah. I was I was gonna call on her. That's great. Did she put herself in the queue? Oh, I didn't see you, Hello. I'm I'm trying to report back for the IAB on this, thing, and I would still be interested to, like, do a poll on the question about the scope because I believe It sounds like everybody's key about the scope, but sometimes doing the poll actually gives some more insights, a poll about what about the scope? Is it? Oh, is the scope clear? Like, the question 2 or 3 from the Okay. Off draft. That he that's up to him. He use the tool mapping. to knows how Yeah. And we do have 9 minutes still, so. No. No. No. No. That would be called premature optimization. So I'm gonna phrase this a little funky, because all questions should be phrased funky. They never go perfectly well. But because because we've done some non action show editing. I'm gonna put You know, given the discussion today, everybody heard it. It it seemed like, you know, there was rough consensus reached"

So that's that's not I mean, the results are not surprising to me because we do need to work toward the scope and write down what was said and and go through the mailing list, which Paul and I already agreed you know, is is the next step. So there will there'll be more to iterate on I think the scope will become more clear. How left? many minutes we have 8 if anybody has a particular you know, complaint, you know, about the scope, feel free to to jump in Warren, you were already up. Go ahead and then you. marry I think it might be useful to do another poll on do we think that we can get to a scope that is clear enough. Right? You know, are we so far away on the scope that we'll never manage get this sorted out, or do we think Some of it was, like, Is it clear as written? I couldn't figure out if he meant is the scope clear as written or, you know, I think we can get a scope that everybody largely agrees with. But the way that that was worded was phrased more as Would you do this one now? I warned you. Yeah. Okay. So before don't you let So the you do it, why me ask if she if do you have some words you would like us to ask? No, not for the question, but, want to just so, like, I I brought this up because right now, I would write in my report that I believe there are people in the room who actually think this, like, everybody in the room wants to do this attention. I think there are people in the room who think this is a really big thing. And we're changing the whole model of DNS. And there are some people in the room who believe this is just like my next extension."

So, Warren, they liked your question better than my question. Even if you turned off your phone. And that is basically how I felt the room was gonna go as well that that The scope is not totally out of line with with, you know, where we're gonna go. It just needs the the word smithing, not the, it's totally wrong. I'm gonna do the You haven't yet start. So So we are almost done I'm gonna play the the the sort of heavy here This community tends to be much more active at face to face meetings than on mailing lists. That won't work for a charter discussion. We know that there are at many places in the proposed charter that are open that we've got suggestions on. We need you to be active on the mail list. And I'm speaking not only to the people in the room, but all the people remote and such like that. If you punt now We're going to get an insufficient charter. So please, please, please plan on staying active on the mailing list at least until we get a rough consensus for the charter to send to the ISG. If you think that this was great, Thank you, but This is a great lead in to more work that we need to do on the mailing list. For at least a few more weeks. Yeah. So sorry. It is the the mailing list that we've been using, which is dd@ietf.org. Any last questions? I see tail getting up. 2"
