So one for for the data collection requirements themselves, it seems to be very much these are this is an engineering job. I'm I'm failing a little bit to see really, actually, the research challenges And I think this would be good to work this out a little bit more specifically. And on this one, basically, my second comment is basically also, actually, to the previous comment, this has also digital twin network And I think it's a actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, actually, thing that I was missing actually was tying this in more with this particular problem space. because I would think actually that there are definitely research question in this thing, but it's not not so much about, okay. How do I set up the collection. I mean, this is pretty much engineering is but as far as I'm concerned, But the the question for instance, you use if you have what's the digital twin, then you use whatever predictive AI methods. It's about to see what the what but this this quiz, how can you basically utilize that to to steer points, your data collection, know what you need to collect to see, basically, whether your predictions are on track on on track where they are deviating those sort of things. It's about this I think looking at it more this problem domain might unearth some actual research challenges. Otherwise, I think also looking at the graph, I don't find it from a research perspective research topic perspective, very convincing. Thank you, Alex. Very good point. We also we also considering this this your your points internally. to see whether some existing existing or material tools or for calculation can be moved to engineering like working groups.

One comment also maybe if I can just add one one more thing concerning the digital print points. What would be interesting would be fun to look also since there are twins, there are two trends. For instance, look at basically, does the do they reflect each other or, basically, how much do they deviate and so and so forth and busy using some of exploring those aspects a little so I'm just just as just as some ideas. Thanks. Thank you. Just before Thomas goes to the mic, I mean, I really welcome the comments think comments are maybe to the draft. There is also the second part where we have a more general discussion, and I think the comments will will align with this other consideration. Thank you. Thomas, up to you. Thomas Kraft from Swisscom. So first of all, thank you very much for the it could work. I want to just comment on section 5dot 25.4 on the draft document. So in the section 5 dot to you this guy being workflow which starts with 1.1and1.2 on the Vicky patient from the DSC to TSC Here, I have a slightly different perspective in my opinion, the network telemetry subscription should act should actually follow the service deployment in the network. So, basically, if I create a new service on the network for that service, I honored also need to define the network tailor make what what I actually want to monitor and then accordingly adjust the network telemetry subscription.

There are also, like, more techniques. I will relate that more to enablers or to modeling. So you have one graph, which is on graph I'm using graph neural networks. to model a digital twin network.

So Hi. for instance, visualization, modeling, different types of simulation or enablers for simulation, aspect of life cycle of the digital twin composition like, in the sense of composability, but also if you want to compose twins together, interoperation. If you have to operate twins between them, Then, of course, as we have seen a lot of questions related to data, I will call it the data layer feeding the tree, but also representation of data and use of data in in the digital twin environment.

What I put with enablers is actually maybe from a research angle, what could be I mean, what are the the challenges or the roadblocks to actually make network digital twin technologies widely available, and then it could be types of investing mechanism, techniques, people have sites, for instance, different types of AI technique, but also modeling and other things. to try really to unlock these these challenges and say, okay.

So this will be just the the concluding remarks. now happening really the floor to the audience also online. to be able to capture your comments. So we already had a a first set before, but we can, of course, go again over that. Oh, you're Rashid from Huawei, Canada again. So one thing that probably would help the entire research in this area would be the use cases that we are we need to cover here. So what do we like, what are we gonna be using the the NDT for? one of the one of the aspects that I'd like to actually use it is to actually verify AI solution for network. right now for the solutions that like, for for problems that we have solutions. You know, we are optimized. We are using AI to optimize get we have a benchmark to actually evaluate the performance of the AI against network. Now there are certain things that we do not know what the AI solution is that are is good. or it's not good. So one aspect of using NDT would be applying the AI within the NDT to see the reaction. and see how basically performs with with those AI solutions in in in place.

This is equally important because training AI is something that very often you have to expose AI to situations that are not usual, that are not I mean, even not desirable, just a clarification. You mean, really the training phase? Or you mean, like, for instance, like, reinforcement learning that is more in touch with an actual network when you have to try No. No. No. I mean, it's it's training. It's it's providing.

And and second is about validating it in the And, again, this is something that we we have. Why we started to use things that are close to the digital twin, was because we wanted to generate control datasets. Knowing what we were generating and that we were in datasets that could be usable because they were not posing anything that was relevant in terms of privacy on the one hand. and even commercial trade trade secrets or or ideas that could be in some by by any means, they they company will not be happy. sharing with with others."

Something that is very important in my view is that you can guarantee that the that the experiments are on the one hand reproducible because you can't I mean, others can can periment the same way. And on the other hand, they are repeatable in the sense that you can random with little variations because you you might be very much interested in in seeing these what if scenarios with small variations to see what happens.

You, Missus from Physician Research of Europe. I agree with the first comment related to AI when you speak about data. So AI is very, very relevant. My take in to it. It's aligned with some what Diego mentioned. It's more what I wanted to see here is more the security aspect, the the privacy preserving aspect because we're talking about network digital twin. I think that trust preserving trust and security is something would be relevant in this case, at least in this What do you think about that? Okay. Could you clarify a bit in which area you see that there could be if we consider -- It can be it can be security or privacy consideration that are a bit more specific general consideration for those domain? 1 of the consideration is I I I see it as one of the enablers for this because there is the network us and the network element of this digital twin that you are mentioning here"

But we also need to agree that the net digital twin, it's like very wide top XL. If we define use cases or the application. will be easier, I guess, to, like,"

    "text": "talk about the specific -- Agree. Agree. Thank you very much. So then we are back to the first comment, which I -- Hi. harassment again. So the other thing that might actually help, the I I find that the the notions of the network digital twin is pretty wide in scope. as we know, network consists of layers. And, you know, the question is what what layer of this network we're going to actually create a digital digital twin 4. I'm sure that they probably can do a better job at the IP level or maybe layer 2 but as we go down to the to the obstacle level, that must be a be very or at least more difficult to actually do it at that level. Now at some point, some of these information have to be simulated to to to go to the So I find that the the the network digital twin actually just like the network self is a layered approach. So and and from the from the user's perspective. They need to be able to define some sort of resolution of of of of this digital twin. what is it that they won't actually see and even at the at the, let's say, if I take the IP layer, what is the resolution at the OIP layer. So This layered approach to to NDTV might be actually try to define them as a research topic. to see how we can actually approach this thing and and define these boundaries around this. to help the research in this area. Thank you for your comment. I mean, Joe, from a personal experience. Every time I discuss network user twin with my colleagues, anyone I need. I always say, can you qualify the network net register team, are you talking about a base station, a router, or an entire I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean 5gcoresoftware. So I think I think a bit what you say because you were talking layer and say, okay. Can we qualify the n in the n d t. That's very important. Again, I'm McDonoughich. So with digital twinning,"

And That is not that hard of a problem to be done because it has been Those creating large configuration to verify from a control perspective that they will work that has been done in the past. but the problem arises when you want to do anything with the data plan scaling. This is one area where the digital twinning is causing problems. because you can verify, functionally, to it will be working. if you want to see how the resource utilization of the under different loads are behaving, This is one area that is extremely expensive to be done, and there there isn't a good way of doing it. So Would there be a way to c what problems could arise at network scale in the digital twin, what kind of new tools could be used except building a parallel network on top of a large production network in order to do that. that would be and and interesting Way, way, it it would be an interesting research area because yeah, there is, for example, radio networks. how do as we are talking more about radio networks inside the enterprise, how they would be scaling in those microlocations, what kind of problems we would run into it from the forwarding perspective, that would be impacting. So we can model again, from a control plane perspective, we can model it. pretty nicely, but then you you really find out the problems when you hit that in the production, and then you're running into bunch of problems. and you really don't know until hit that. Hit that. So something that could help in that area there to be"

    "text": "useful, even having some basically using AI models, ae used used AI to train models on large networks and then use it for training, in in for that training simulations that that might be in an idea Okay. I think just reacting a bit to your comment is that For instance, the work from the team of Alberkavellos on graph neural network for using digital twin day bit started from this approach to say, can we have accurate enough modeling both of the structure of the network, but also about the traffic or the user behaviors. and even maybe some behavior of the network devices like bugs in the network, in the in the router to make it that that that simulating or not, but but use of digital twin is representative enough of this kind of data plane behaviors and you can put it into different situations. So there is a question of this accuracy if it is representative enough after would be behaviors. And I think this is a a key questions for simulation modeling and and different aspects. We got this all the Huddl Huawei You mentioned one reason as well inside IETF for its Stanley. And he also mentioned now that the and and and and mentioned layering and modeling. So I just wanted to say that we are doing the draft the draft in ops a area that where we are composing the digital model in approach using rca 345 as a court logic model players to logical model that you can use from Leivang for the customer service that could potentially be the core applies to model for the pure win as a kind of something that bring and bring and bring and bring and bring all the other functional parts. together together So that may be something that"

I think we I mean, we have not yet had this connection between the work that you're proposing in ops area. on the digital map and this consideration in the network management result, but It was obviously, I think, in in even one of your slide, you mentioned that digital map is kind of building blocks for a digital twin vision. So there could be relationship also, and we welcome if you want to present your work also. as a one component that could be in the scope And and it's it can provide the the API for the apologies. So it is a kind of model and the API for the core of course, not for all the other functional just logical layer. Alex? Yeah. So I'll extend. Yeah. So I have also an add on comment perhaps Dan's comments earlier. He was referred to a network scale, another aspect concerns, initially little spin. is an abstraction. It is a model. And so one question in my mind is also how course and every extract, of course, omits part of the reality. one question is, how course can the model be and still be useful for certain purposes. And one of the aspect I see here also on your on your slide, you put modeling simulation especially a lot of use cases go into this model based reasoning type of but it's basically a non discipline, and one of the pitfalls. There's always that whenever you try to do model based reasoning, you find out whether the model is never complete or perhaps not complete enough for your purposes. And this is one of the reasons also to be skeptical application of that predicted twin in this area, But perhaps one thing would be to to to be able to to to quantify or somehow characterize"

I fully concur with your comment for me, it's also a bit an intrinsic definition of twin we are talking about, like, really kind of unique exact copy of the system we want to replicate. So I think I think For me, the the design principles should be that we should have an as accurate as possible representation. doesn't mean that it needs to be huge. It's just that it needs to be able to sure well, the behavior of what we want to replicate. it doesn't need to it cannot be sold generic because then it's not a tree. It's something else. So they are I mean, if we want to be consistent also with the the use of the term, it puts requirements on this accuracy. Okay. I will use just the remaining time to go to the conclusion side. First, thanks a lot to the comments received, and we will also bring that to main English to the, let's say, collect the the the command and additional feedback and to aggregate them to to build this research agenda proposal. I was just also a bit thinking about how we can organize it at the research group level to to structure in the moving forward. So first, Again, we are a research group, so we we have valuable inputs to to the group in terms of draft, in terms of proposals. I think we should already stick to the basics that start by formulating good research questions. on this topic and also set the objectives. What do we want to demonstrate to overcome? in terms of of the work that will be proposed. I mean, it could as the research group, but also individual proposals. So really to differentiate the research work to be done by the group from what could be, for instance, standardization work or also engineering work which The good thing is that we are in the ATF also.

I don't say that we need to have one everything fitting into one one block, but to understand if we have, for instance, data collection requirements with data generation or modeling, how they relate to each other. And maybe there are also some relationship that could be useful to understand between the proposals. Second aspect is a bit more delegates to approach because it's setting priorities of focus. It's a research group already open to to any contribution, it's contribution driven. The thing is that at point also, we need maybe to concentrate some efforts on priority topics focused area because if you want to generate enough enough momentum, enough progress, in a timely manner. on some areas because if we try to tackle everything in parallel, I think maybe we will not be an efficient use of the the resources and Maybe we will not be able to to to show progress in a meaningful way to keep people invested into the research. The 3rd aspect is also that beyond, let's say, the research question and the proposal is the form of the results we aim to provide is also important. at some point because there could be of course Internet draft as a vehicle of showing the the supporting the discussion and the progress of the work. force. This is a a natural medium force. could be also publication. We are a research group. Nothing prevents us for supporting the research, the outcome through publication in various forms. I think also in this area, specifically, there could be implementation proof of concepts, demo, pieces of of elements that could not only the paperwork or, I mean, this kind of outcome of the research, think also a bit more pragmatic applied. demonstration of of the work. I really encourage this this to be considered."

This this is what we aim to produce, Because others will also do different research and investigate different aspect of networketer twin. So I think we should also try to announce what we we would like to promote. propose and also to benefit benefit from but also contribute to cross pollination I mean, there are there are different groups, I mean, even beyond networking per sel group. association, alliance, etcetera, for that are discussing digital twin technologies. which you can learn a lot from them in terms of architecture modeling platforms, etcetera, that are available, and we can make more use of them into the network environment. And, finally, this is just a few proposal for a step forward to I mean, to initiate and to continue the work we that the research group has started, including the existing documents that that you saw before. So to initiate the work on network digital twin research challenges, I think this was also mentioned today by Alex, but also in previous side meetings, we we insisted on this aspect of documenting research challenges even if it's in a working document, needs to be a finalized one. concentrate also on design guidelines and architecture. use cases was mentioned several times. I also believe this could be very important to highlight specific use and and can give us very start to provide answers what design choices we need to have and requirements. enabler.

What are actually the standard implication? to to other groups to to try to to help also on this on this aspect. So That's it in terms of overall conclusion of this discussion. I don't know if we have time for any any final remarks, feedback on this let's say, proposal for the research agenda. Of course, I said, this will be, let's say, brought also to the mailing list. And with Jerome, we will try to animates that this has become more, let's say, concrete definition with text, milestones, something organizing a bit this this approach. Excellent. We finished on time. From time. Yes. So thank you all again, and we hope to see you to the next we organize. So tomorrow, same meeting, and after tomorrow, the second session. Thank you. if you run"
