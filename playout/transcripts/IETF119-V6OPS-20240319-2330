So we have a fully packed agenda from a job perspective, it's healthy that Chang is going up since IETF 118, I think the working group and make some, good progress First, more and more people know of the ipv6, mostly solution, deploying it, not only Google, but also, actually right here in IETF 119 also in right 87 in supercomputing, 2023. So this is good progress. Also since the last IETF, Nick, became, cool chair, and he's doing a great job in bringing more enterprise to the working group So this is great, but we still need a more participation and active participation, from enterprise, from carrier, and from academia. And if anybody is writing your draft for the first time because we saw some such a comment in the mailing list, and you'll feel a big company nervous. You came"

This is, useful solution for a number of, problems such as edge's accountability, for example, So this is another important, progress Also, there are 3 draft and move to working group last call or past working group last call. So this is part of, under the guidance of Warren, we are Moving faster. The progress observed in the working group. Moving forward, Way people to continue to contribute to, Brian Carpenter's online book, this is really the central location of ipv6 wisdom for example, after 118, we have a very long discussion in the mailing list. Option 108xuse a lot of valuable opinion was is press and Brian have already added some of the, for example, the some guidance for ipv6 mostly deployment, into the book. So this is very good. And, again, we want more people to contribute it to because people started to deploy ipv6 mostly, It actually exposed mainly XUs like deal stack. Mask.

We have been measuring the people for a long time, but I think, like, the methodology we use for people not be able to be used for IoT, so they need some new methodology to matter This may be very good research topic for graduate student.

So, let's move on Thank you. Sir. Hi, everybody. Tim Winters. I'm here today to talk about V 6 and home gateway. So there's 2 presentations I'm doing. The first one is a working group document. This was previously, I think I've talked about it the last 2 ITS. This is the main goal of ISPs today do a great job of getting out. Prefixes larger than 64,"

So 64 gets to the ISP edge router, and then it never gives out any more other than ones that are sitting on, it's interfaces. Occasionally, it'll break them out 1 to a guest network, 1 to the primary at work. But for the most part, We've not seen a whole lot of gateways do prefix delegation on the LAN side. So we wanna fix that. So, well, the changes we've made since the last presentation. So Last time I presented this, there was a little bit of an up uproar. About, flat and hierarchical both being defined in this document. So what I did for this since then as I've removed both of the deep definitions of both of those. I point to them saying that these are both options that you could do to delegate the prefixes in the home, choose your path. I reference the hierarchical comes from The cable app specification, the e router spec, is where that's actually documented. And then flat, I basically document here in the it's pretty straightforward that you give out prefixes of slash 64 everywhere. To everybody. The what we did now is we reduced all that text what it says now is that it should be a default of 64. Obviously, if an operator wants to do something different, they can go nuts but the default should be 64. So that's gets us in the cases where users don't know doing and plug it in, it shouldn't damage the network. Okay. So After all of those changes, it seems people were okay with all of that. It got adopted in working group. I'm not sure there's any other changes. It took us a while to get this document adopted. The only other thing I did wanna note about this presentation. We don't fully specify what internal routers and what I mean by an internal router here is it's not a snack router, but it's not an edge router. The ones that sit in between those as intermediate routers, we wanna tell them what to do with prefixes"

And then we've gone been It's been I think 10 year 10 years, I was kinda shocked by how long it had been for this one. Maybe not 10 years. That might have been node requirements. Anyway, it'd been a while. We haven't updated this. So we think it's time to update it. There's a couple of basic things I'm gonna talk about. In this, but this is the update. So 70, 84 biz. Okay. So one of the primary things we wanted to do is the basic RFC updates. We were still getting who are complaining about they were supporting 2460, not 82100. There were some really dumb things going on there. And they would point to 7084 and say, hey. 7084 says 2460. So we fixed all of those. So we take all of the basic RFC updates. So for those Not in the know, that's, 82100spacev6 8415 is dhcpv6update and 8504 is node requirements. Great. We removed the transition text. This was kind of a weird spot when 7 to 84 came out,"

We removed that all of that text. The main one got a little scary here for me was we've I've had some CPEs coming to me saying, because they read 7084, they had to implement 6 RD with no interest in their operators actually doing it. So that's the kind of stuff we don't wanna have happen. So, so took all that text out. Another requirement we added in the original document is a should for ingress filtering. We think this should be a must This is anti spoofing. We wanna stop malware from getting extra ways to get out in the world. This is an easy fix that would prevent a lot of malware situations, in particular, the scary ones where something's hijacking a bunch of IoT devices and doing bad things, but generating spoofed addresses. All of those, this could easy fix. We should make this a mess. There's no reason we shouldn't do that. 90 96 we added. So that was an update. 7084. This has to do with Trying to remember which one this is. This is Renumbering, I think. This is stateful renumbering. We added that in. That's just part of the regular Biz update. We took all the updates in there. So we put those racks in there. The other one that started this actually was There was a paper out there. Saying UI 64 on the WAN interfaces meant you could track people It's not a great situation. So we say, hey. Don't don't do that. Don't use the UI 64 addresses on your way in interfaces.

What is it you you wanted to say about or what what did people ask me for NGP? So there Jordy, one of my co authors, thinks that we should require that. The original version of 7084 says NTP on the LAN. So this is handing out all the options and doing all of that is out of scope. Right? And he says, well, every CPE has that built in. From my perspective, I think we're talking two slightly different things here. Right? I I think it's one thing for it to be giving out an with an NTP server. It's entirely different. I, you know, I don't see a whole lot of home gateways come with NTP options giving out an NTP server. Right? Most clients get it from someplace else. So I I would envision leaving it instead of having home gateways handing out NTP that way servers. I actually think it's it's both those things.

David Lompater. To throw more onto this fire. There's ways 2 very different that this can be interpreted. The one is to actually just relay the NTP information that the router got from upstream which sounds perfectly fine. But the other is to run NTP directly on the router, which is a horrible idea in my opinion. So it needs to be clarified which of the 2 this is actually referring to. Yeah. I, I, I think if we say anything, we should be very clear about that. I agree. That's one of my fears, actually, with this whole thing. Yes. Hello, Carsten here. So we work a lot of IIT networks, which are also offline, and seeing this discussion, I see that this is not, reflected. And so if we have such a requirement having NT p as a base function of a router, which means we need infrastructure even in networks where we don't have an online router right now.

Just to recap, so the draft is about to present the solutions, solutions currently available. So something that we can find in, live networks to support the multi home incona activity based on IPD 6. And the idea is to discuss strengths and their weaknesses, Now let me pause for a second here because I need to place a forward statement. The authors are not supporting or endorsing any of the solutions that we address in our draft. That's because we want to reinforce the message that our preference goes for, let's say, the native solutions, that provide IPV 6 end to end connectivity without any kind of translation. That's for our preference, yet in the field, we find that many more ops on. So the idea is to take them and discuss in our draft. The reason for doing that is that you find If you reference, probably the most important one is, listed at the bottom of the slide it's a RFC, 4984, which discusses the evolution of the use of BI addressing for providing, multi homing connectivity based on activity 6, for, business sites. Are some indications. It's something important here to discuss whether That's correct or not, whether the projection is right, but indicates. That's a reference. So said that, the solutions are clearly based on ipv6, and we know that native solutions are throwbacks. So the idea is to discuss them. The solutions are listed there.

You see that ideally, the solutions that can knowledge the technologies employed should support clearly end to end connectivity provide, site resilience through multiple carriers. And even one of the CPE or the CE, gets a failure, goes down, yet the internal connectivity should be granted and supported and so on. You can clearly read the draft and see all the discussion about that. You see there is space 4 more requirements. So I just anticipate a question that I will repeat in a minute. We are open to any contributions that you see as important and for discussing the draft. Then we took the requirements against some scenarios. You see one that represented their just for the sake of providing an example. That's the case of, use of Provider Aggregatable solutions. So you see Raleigh. Perfect, prefixes or addresses that are sent to the host from multiple carriers, they are different clearly because We have a 2 CPs connected in some way to different providers. And those providers may have, for example, dedicated services such as a walled garden, then we have, a active active configuration the 2 CPs and so on.

And we also add in appendix, and I'm going to introduce that in the next slide. The idea was to try to see What is really used in the field? This survey, I can say, got, if I remember correctly, 22 answers, unique answers. So probably from a statistical standpoint, it's not it. So I will say, meaningful, yet it's the first indication. What is used in the field? Well, you see, for example, question 1, how many CPs are used the majority says 2. 2 CPs to have It's the the support of at least the connectivity to 2 different carriers. Question number 2, how they are configured in terms of uplinks, you see more or less, the situation is is a kind of, split. There is one link per carrier.

Clearly, we have only 12 unique responses. So, again, probably is not so statistically, meaningful. So there is the opportunity to get more information.

We can do the same thing. I'm not entirely sure we should be encouraging it so much.

The other thing I was I was going to point out was, and I I wonder whether this will cause some some fuss, but Realistically, I, I, I, I understand the elegance of the pie solution.

So, yeah, strikes back. There are many cases when renumbering can ipv6 break things. Right? We've heard quite a lot from people who care about ISP deployments, about CPs, and prefix when delegated previous changes, CPEs might not propagate the change, to the client. But also in, like, enterprises and enterprise environment, we have other cases of or Renard Birank. Slack prefix might change. For example, if you proper intent driven network. You change your intent. Configuration is pushed. Your, like, prefixes your number. Or maybe it's just a manual config change.

When radios provide the VLAN number rails indication event might lead to VLAN change.

You have multiple prefixes and you need to it's actually basically a corner case. Right? You have 2 prefixes. One of them is not working.

It's what I observed in my network dot 1 house indication moved port. Place port to be on a. It gets prefix a. And later, the client might move to another villain. Ideally in the ideal world, the client needs to detect this, understands that, dotonex state changes from house indicated to authenticated or vice versa and do something with IP stack. In reality, I do not know if any host operating system does the right thing here. All of them are just I'm fine. And as far as I know more like enterprise operators. See, using these, they put in some automation around Aziz to deal with that. So Again, it would cause an unpleasant effect of host heaven, 2 prefixes are only one of them actually working.

Like, we repeat virtual mark, which depends which is derived from VIRR PID? And why would they have different VIRR PIDs in in the same wheel on button 2 different buildings. No reasons. Right? Some implementations violates where our previous rerif is which actually prohibits to derive virtual local address from MAC address. But a lot of implementations do this.

For ipv6, they explicitly say that that thing could only work in the assumptions that your default router link local address and MAC address are different when you move between links. So why would router have the same link clock all the time. First of all, we kind of do not we normally do not care about what link local address the router has, right, because it's supposed to be the specific to the link. It could be actually the same between different links. The corp is leak. So, again, for VRRP, It's quite common to have the same link local everywhere for the same group ID.

That's that's what you wanna tell people to do, I I don't think this is gonna be successful if that's game plan. If you want operators to figure out how they're going to set every link Okay.

I So, I think it's, the point you want to address is, totally understand. So we had faced this problem very often. But I wanna is it would it be maybe simpler just to say don't use linked local address as gateway just use the ULA of a router as know, like, well, your neighbor discovery works on Lynn Clocal. Right? Your router sends a race from link locals. That's one hosts installed as default gateways. Yes. So maybe very controversial here. But just this is a general problem we have.

And then, of course, other RFCs have passed since recently that we want to update 85 85. In a nutshell, although it is a pretty short draft, encourage everyone to read it, You need to be using unique ipv6 addresses per interface so that we can do stateless for tons of reasons. We use from the previously defined slash 29, which puts a maximum with that combines to make a maximum of 8 sealant instances on the same node.

However, we're currently conflicted as to if you discover CLab before you discover IP before availability and then later find it, what do you do? Go back to it, which will temporally disrupt connectivity. Stick with sealat, might have a performance hit We're thinking about it and open the feedback. You can use option 108 to disable this with out affecting ipv4 only hosts but that doesn't apply to all situations But if we say by discovery only that we're going to go to see that even when IPV is available. There are issues with networks that weren't accounting for that and having spoofed non DHCP channels redirecting you to CLab may not be desirable. So, open question. Less of an open question and more talking about how to deal with prefixes We just saw Jen described what happens when we don't do addresses selection correctly, but we think that for native ipv6, that's something we're all doing pretty well. For CEA implementers turns out you need to make sure you're doing the same thing. Because if you keep using the same select source address, after you get a new PIO, fun things happen.

Because otherwise, you have no idea what comes back. So DNS sec is important. So how well does V Six work with large UDP packets and DNSsec. Because that's kind of one sentence. So we did this test. Joao and I, back in December January, using around 500,000,000 individual measurements."

And ads oddly enough, are quite amazing because insider analysis is scripting language. And all the scripting language does for me is to get URLs. Right. I use unique domain names to defeat caching and then a customized DNS server and a customized web server. And in this case, I'm really looking at the DNS. And and looking at How many folk come at me. Now The funny thing about the DNS is that you might think you might ask one query. You would be wrong. When you ask one query from your browser, somebody immediately turns it into 2. Around 46% of all end users, a single query in the scripted ad becomes at least 2 queries than if it's the DNS infrastructure. 03 or 4 or 5 or 6, and some of you You wanna put their hand up or astonishingly enthusiastic and can offer 10,000 queries with exactly the same query name inside around 5 seconds. You're not putting your hand up, but we know who you are. Amazing. Now my machines Always answer. Always as fast as they can. No tricks. It obeys what's in in the packet. If you come with me at TCP, it's TCP. If you offer some kind of, you know, eating a serial buffer size parameter, it'll obey that. Before only. So I'm dual stack, of the 1, 2, 3, whatever queries I see, If all of them are in V Four, 43% of the queries that were asked, 43% of users on the internet by inference.

Whatever. 46% asked me of users were behind revolvers that asked in both protocols. So Quite frankly, less than half of all these named Resolution query sequences showed both protocols. Odd, there's only one server. It does have 2 addresses. But the query farming doesn't seem to sort of change the protocol very often. You just change the resolver and hope you get a better sir, I guess. Is there happy eyeballs? Mark Andrews has had to, I think, leave to go back to Sydney. Of the folk who asked twice, I look twice or more, I look at the first two queries. The first two And if there was a preference to use 6, I would expect the first query I see to come at me in 6. The second query to go, well, well, it's one name server you've got 4. Haven't got the answer in time. I'll ask again in 4. Now that only happened around 22% of the time, the exact reverse around 20% V6 only around 20% and V4 only, as you see up there, around just under 40%. I don't see a bias to 6 in that data. It may be there, and indeed, the folk behind bind tenders has suggest that they have code that when they order the name servers, they will prefer 6.

It sounds like for the green bar, A recursive result for somewhere sends you a V Six query, which you're answering as fast you can but regardless, the recursive result goes too slow. I'm gonna give you the same query again. Another resolver, it may or may not be the same one. In the DNS, we actually don't know what a resolver is. And sometimes it's a farm, sometimes the query is forked, you know, I get questions for the same query night. Each ad, each measurement is a unique name. So folk are asking me the same name. Now it might be the same IP address asked me in 6 4. How do I know it's the same resolver? Really good question. I'm not sure. So I I can't say it's the same resolver flipping protocol stacks. I'm saying that the first query was 6 and the second query was for, it would be strong evidence that there's a V Six bias out there. And that's great. But I can't see it in that data. Okay. So Maybe I'm missing some of the golfers here. Why is there a second query at all for the same name. Woah. There are PhDs going, and there's all kinds of of folks would love to answer, why is the DNS its own piece of AI I think it's a sentient life form. It's you. We just haven't recognized it for decades. Yeah. Why? Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Great question. I'm busy pressing next. I really am. I'm pressing next. What happens now? Do I press back forward? You were moving your mouse. Yeah. Okay. This is one of the more puzzling parts of the DNS because I look at those first two queries and I analyze the time difference between them. You will see peaks.

It's DNS mask, and it sits inside CPEs and DNS mask just simply thinks, well, because queries are free, I'll make a lot of them. A huge amount. And this back to backing that occurs up in the first 20 milliseconds might will be the reason why all this other data gets clouded. Because right at the edge, There is insanity. Absolute insanity. Because who can resist free software. Evidently none of the CPE vendors. Penny really. So the answer is there's no in in what we see There's no pronounced happy eyeballs version. He might say, well, DNS mask sort of covers it over, but what we see at the authoritative Is there's no V Six preference to answer? You know, so, no, there's no happy eyeballs And and there's a slight bias in V Four. If you go back to that data, 40% of queries, multiple queries are in just V4only. Okay. So the answer to the first, no one probably. 2nd one, I'm gonna put it in V Six only. Do you want me to pause you Okay. I'm gonna put it in V Six only. How many can reach me if the only way to reach me is in V Six, and I'm counting users. I'm not counting resolvers. So it's a really simple thing. 35% of users sit behind DNS resolution in structure that has no V Six. One third of the world has no V Six, which is actually better than users. The same test in the web says 35% also have V Six capability. The rest of the world, Dustin, In the DNS, it's up to 65%."

Here's a few DNS keys. They they be. Yay. What actually happens is that More than 300 sites just in the root zone. If you're running DNS, you're gonna have to ask for their DNS key. You're going to have to cope with packets that are larger than 1500 octets no matter what. Somehow that data has to get back to you if you're gonna validate their answers.

You can't alter the packet that you sent. It's gone. So you now have to go through a large amount of effort as anyone's tried this. That when you get back one of these messages saying too big, You've got a case in the forwarding table. You then gotta say for any packets to that destination, typically for 15 minutes. Fragmented source. So it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. And, quite frankly, in the DNS, you might be placing too much work on the DNS timers because when you ask for a name to get resolved, you're not gonna hang around have a cup of tea, have another cup of tea, sit around for a while, Oh, so DNS come back. Yay. Let's move on. It doesn't work like that. So in this case, what we do is send large answers. They're big.

Yay. 30 years later ain't gonna happen. It it's it's just not fixable. This kind of problem has now got to the stage where the install base is not gonna We gotta live with fine. So what we probably need to do is to avoid packet fragmentation completely. But I'm not telling you anything that wasn't already said in RFC Mumble Mumble back in in March 2017 because in the UDP usage guidelines in the said, For god's sake, don't fragment. Do anything you want, but the fries don't fragment. So How do we do this? Well, we changed that suggested buffer size, here, I can handle anything up to well, I don't know, 1280 octets. And after that, truncate. You don't try it anymore. Do not fragment. So we need to we have workarounds by changing that EDNS above a size. But do we do it? Do we do it? I haven't got the slide here. Around about 67% of resolvers are still offering buffer sizes that lie when they say I can handle big packets in V Six. The Indian S buffer size that's actually being presented Massive numbers are still at 4096, and other numbers are still ridiculously high.

I have a reasonable belief that your DNS mask theory doesn't work because DNS mask is generally configured to forward to other recursive resolvers. So you should never see that hitting your DNS server. I think there's something else going on there, and that bears further investigation. The DNS is a wonderful thing. So many people spend so much time at because none of us understand it. Thank you. Stewart Joshua, Thanks, Jeff. As always, great work. My very quick comment is and I might have misunderstood you, but the way you use the term happy eye balls It seemed like what you meant by that was a preference for V Six. And That is not intention of happy eyeballs. The essence of happy eyeballs is you rank the candidates in order of your preference, whatever that may be, and then you try the first one, and you don't try all of them simultaneously. That would be a misunderstanding of happy eyeballs. The idea is you try the first one, but but but But then you wait for a reasonable round trip time where you'd expect to have 90 plus percent success rates. And if you don't, Then you rapidly start going through the rest. So, it's not Do them all at once, which is a huge waste of capacity and and load on the surface. And it's not the old sequential way of, like, do one and be sure that it's really timed out before you try the second one. It's a middle ground."

For the web, And so is she understanding how the DNS is working in dual stack gets really interesting. Is V Six slower for the user? Now that's a great question. And it's actually all about the density of V Six and the caching populate in the V Six protocol as to where this stuff gets fed. And and so the answer is, as always, in the DNS, it depends. I'm using happy eyeballs as shorthand for We should really prefer V Six if we want V Four to die automatically. Which is a longer thing to say. That is certainly within the API frameworks. Yes, but there's more than happy.

Where they decided fragmentation was fantastic, and instead of the old conservative 512 Octet, They come up with, well, let's put a field that goes big What's a good number? You read the early drafts of that EDNS 0 thing, and it says, what, 496 will work.
