I think that next to the first and the art, also for the world, and for 12th country. In 6 continents. So for each continent, we pick 2, countries.

And, result, it over the wall, it will be 90%. Slightly less usable on the ipv6 packet loss rate that we narrow the range down to maybe 0.5to0.6 per se.

To implement, the the major problems on why, the current implementation of collective communication. It's not so performance because the point upon implementation of this, practice, because mass overhead, reflect reflect in 3 different perspectives. One is we will, occupy large bandwidth because there are lots of duplication in the packets transmitted on the. And also, it will introduce lots of, data movement and also it will it it will inevitably introduce lot number of data copies at endpoints. So there will be, very obvious communication bottleneck and performance gradation. So, if you want to design format networking, find, better solution. You need to say bandwidth. And, because, it's really, especially for bandwidth sensitive applications like this real AI, the bandwidth is the new oil I like the metaphor. It's not from me, but I think it's quite impressive. And also need to reduce data movement and decrease data copies. So This leads to a a solution called collective communication, collecting operation offloading. And it's very related to, a term like in other computing. So next slide, please. So here you can see that the communication pattern we have So the the problems and the requirements in our drafts that the submitted to TSB Working Group if you are interested, you can see more details in the drops.

There is no human administrators inside the information space And it finally makes the concept of global antitrust across the main possible. This is this was not possible a few years ago. This is in fact enabled by confidential computing. Also known as trusted execution environments, here are the 3 key properties to make this possible and the fact that the data is for tax aid. In use so that you can actually manage keys within those environments. The fact that you can remote, you know, remotely very find those things through the attestation process. And the fact that those chips have these very viable sources of atrophy that enables you to do decentralized cryptography in a remotely verifiable way. And so our goal, of course, is to fix the fundamental weaknesses of the the today's domain centric architecture, where you can't get rid of the privilege insiders. Everything is supposed to be administered by people how do you remove them from the equation? And the second thing is that you strings you can't do cryptographic linking or chaining or binding with it. So we are left with, you know, associations of data with URI. That is at the goodwill of whoever programmed to serve on the other side. And so this is reflected, you know, from Alice and Bob's perspective. In the today's world. They are just resources within domains. And there is no zero trust from this perspective. They have to have blind faith in everything that sits in the middle. It's reflected in the structure of URLs where everything is under the authority the domain name and the domain administrators.

The agents get very tied by the UNS and the UCA. between attestation you know, layers you actually have a path to automate key exchanges. And that's what enables automated end to end cryptography between any 2 entities. The concept is fully recursive, hierarchical, so you can layer it up.

For, reducing the post quantum signature size impact on expanding message series. So if you have multiple messages coming along, you can sign an overarching thing once and use the authentication path to verify those messages independently so that you reduce the amount of time you have to spend the size you have to spend on those post quantum signatures. Now there's concepts in here about a ladder and a rung so that it could evolve as you add more. You don't have to redo it all for the older messages, and it lets you continue along with the series. At a high level. And that's so what are the benefits? Well, the main benefit so that I keep moving quickly here. The main benefit is that it allows you to shorten the signatures, use constructs that are available today, like, Ashes are already available in a lot of places, and they're already fairly efficient So you can reduce that overall impact of the new algorithms on the series. We introduced a draft at IETF117 to ensure concepts of MTL Mode. And really what I'm here to talk to you today is last week, we had open a reference implementation library. The implements that"

And, We are now starting this personal agent, list to with a goal of, establishing a standard work group. Next slide, please. So please join the, mail list or contact me directly. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Adrienne. Neck Alright. Thank you. Okay. Hi, everyone. There's a lot of people there. I was there in the front row. I couldn't see how how Okay. So My name is Jean Francois. I managed an organization called Area Foundation, and I'm trying to figure out place for some research we've been doing in the past years, and we kind of suspect the IRTF could be a placement I would like your opinion and possibly some feedback from you."

    "text": "So the idea that we had back in the days was to ensure that technology doesn't do certain things by design. Kind of a very aspirational idea. Then if you think about it, so every single, product that you acquire or that you use, in minimally regulated in the tree will have two sides to it. Of them is gonna be compliance, and the other one is value proposition. And in those industries, no one is competing at the compliance level. That's the bare minimum for you to be in that industry, whereas that's not what's happening in the software. Industry. There's no such thing as verifying compliance of GDPR for There's no standard way to do it and that can be applied for a number of things. And so What was basically that, inspiring us was this joke that I read many, many years ago, and still think it's more nerdy joke ever. It's true. So you would as as us building technology. We are the ones who can control what that technology cannot cannot do. Problems at the moment, we don't have the language to define exactly what that is. And so the idea was precisely because, So none of us right now, unless there's some hidden architect around here, gets to care about why this building is not collapsing in our heads. We just take it for granted. And you would hope that, the final user of any particular digital product also doesn't have to be concerning themselves how it's ill. The reality right now is that they need to know way too much. It's a very interesting cognitive business that we have, in the industry. And so, slide. So examples about problems that we have right now. So data protection laws are a mess it's great that they exist, but you don't have an actual SDK for instance, to be able to implement them. It's even worse when you have cross border exchanges where ideally, you would like to have the situation where you send some data between motors and you can add a manifest or indicating what you want. To happen to the data and what you don't want to be having that data. That's not possible at the moment."

    "text": "And the next step would be to be able to do remote attestation to verify with their those requirements in the manifesto have been or not observed. You know, we hear a lot of conversation and a lot of concern about god. Yeah. He's gonna be cute people. He's gonna do these bad things and bad know, whatever. Sure. Can you please define me what that means? How we're gonna be testing our room algorithmically that it happens or not. We don't have that at the moment. And think about neural implants that are coming up. Neuralink has been approved by the FDA for human testing. It's great that we will be able to allow people to walk again. I don't think it's so great that it will be possible to inject images into context. Again, we don't have possibility to verify that those things happen or not happen or not happen. So part of the things that we would like do in the in his research group if you'd ever makes sense for us to have it over here. Be looking into, some data modeling that have to do digital twins and so forth. We see the importance of some taxonomies, which specifically those related to what will be the processes that you don't want to happen upon data for those negative outcomes and one very interesting one on data use case scenarios, which we haven't found anywhere. So the asks are gonna be for you if you'll know if this has been attempted before, what worked, what didn't work. Audition collaborators, Soviet experts, and detractors that always helps a lot. You can find me around. That's my email. That's also my gift card. And so Thank you. Great. And last but not least, our last presenter, Okay. But he wants me in control. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, Welcome. My name is Janfred. I'm with the DFN, the German Research And Education Network, And we are one of the"

    "text": "national roaming operators for eduroam So we are in charge of a Durham, Germany. And I before I was working at the DM, I was at the university a Brahman and I was administrative the at your own there. And from that, I have a lot of experience with everyone and the problems that especially end users get into So, together with some colleagues in the edirong Europe steering group. We want to propose a new method based on title keys. When we don't want to do something new, we need to ask ourselves why? Well, at your own configuration is not trivial. There are a lot of configuration options that you need to trust the user to get right. In order to get a secure ADROM connection. And certificates checks are hard, and there is in the current interface, at least no implicit way to derive, for example, the expected certificate name based on the information that the user is is expected to get right. For example, if if if if if I have an account for TFm then@cfm.de. Bootstrapping and bring your own device environments is also very a very big problem. So, what are the new requirements for this method, well, we want to have a trivial configuration. We can expect the user to know that their realm isdfm.de, but that's all they should input. So, we don't want to rely on users to securely configure things. And the second thing is we want to move away from passwords. Authentication through knowledge is fine but revealing that knowledge in the process is is a bad idea. Because we have to trust the whole transport way that no one loses this password."

    "text": "How do we solve this now? Well, we use asymmetric crypto and we use file keys. A lot of devices already carry fido compatible, software tokens I can use title with my Android device Yeah. And there are is the possibility to use hardware tokens we have a way to provision these title keys for example, via web of end. So we have the simple web portal where users can register piece and then on the device, they just select, okay, I want to use Eggy Rome with Fido and my realm is dfn.de. And the device already knows, okay, now I expect a ATLS certificate 40fn.de, and the user does not need to configure any security parameters because if we use web PKI for web auth and then we can use web PK I 4e EAP authentication. So what now, well, we have an early draft there. Still a lot of to dos in there. We have a site meeting on Monday So tomorrow at 8, 6 PM. In column 4. And we are looking for feedback on the design if there are some people that operate EAP servers. Please shared your experiences if there are people that know Fido very well and immediately say, well, there's a red flag. Please come talk to us. So we will present this in the emo session and Yeah. Just find me or my, colleague Stephan Winter in the hallway. For discussions. Thank you."

So how does the timer button look? You just pressed it in the fantastic. Oh, I just closed that in the medical Mhmm. the bottom, there's like a On buttons for an extra menu with a couple of extra options. There's a timer. But then it just you fill in how many minutes or seconds or whatever and and then you can do it again if we get it wrong. Okay. You just go back into the try to bend you the same way and you can cancel it. Yep. Okay. It's very helpful since they added that. We've started with sort of, like, trying to do a separate treatment app. You know, I'm Yeah. And it's so Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Thank you very much. So it's Spencer calling to come again. Beautiful. Is it? I think so. Just to let I think she just wasn't able to travel Yeah. Yeah. Good. I'm sure if you've wanna help out with this again? Yeah. I'm sure. I would if I'm here. Because what they want? No. I thought I might be the judge. Them. What? Not. I actually have no problem. I was wondering what's my remains of my hope."
