Like, like, you show there you can have a good package and the bad packet can in both come on the provider interface, and it is hard to tell which is good and which is bad. You just accept both.

Traffic from both of the four and back burner. That means the destination and sas threats should be just to turn wrong. Is forward and backward the direction. So in most of the sr six. As service implementation today. The source address is using the little better address. But the destination is kind of we can see. So So that means the traffic from the forward and where direction not symmetric. So traffic be dropped by firewall. With sit as self dress. We can meet the requirement of the firewall That has a host direction of the flow has a symmetric address. So That is a first use case. Now Is two and three, I've for already and service respectively. So the idea is to because you at highway six even for a a special for Bm model. It's is easy a two to fa and destination see that less user to access any of the. So it even if the vp vpn not itself. So the idea is to do the a vpn verification on the tail end of the the service tunnel, like what we have"

Thank you. So I can't often my cameras so maybe in So maybe okay. I... Okay. You can I me? Yeah. We you can't hear you. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Today, my topic is a source address edition has its security using in Blockchain. I I'll talk about as a briefly next next please. Okay. With without ross, I can the best on routing information on download information after the root routine information and the point in the I took attacker. There will be nowhere way to verify the also hesitate of the route routine information that the the loss. So we are be incorrect. Okay. The main security are to sell come from the following areas.

So Considering about the problem. Western about blockchain as a good is a ghost solution. Blockchain technology due to its natural our decent centralization. I'm proof of.

A way to frame with this solution seems to be looking for is to allow a said of c parties to override legitimate resource allocations. To say what I'm going to do or that do from a source validation perspective. If that's not your intent write that up. But that's that those questions are for other working groups. Yeah. But let's about sound mechanism is the cells security is very important. So maybe we can we can... We can use blockchain. So proposal draft. But also it proposed draft. I will also be clear. Soil solutions are much much later in our charter. Even if this war in scope, it is way premature and I don't want spending time arguing about it. But... I we do not have time for the next... It's ten twenty nine. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I we shouldn't... I think the shares shouldn't have put this on the agenda. I'm sorry. And that's that? Yeah. Okay.

And when we see sa idea, we found that maybe we can set up with some solution based on the network. So that we can such as achievable though active while. Of the something like that. That's page. So as a basic architecture like that next page, like Sd the architecture. We have the routers, which can support some that basic functions.

Maybe we can do the a attract source tracing. And the last one, we can optimize the so security planning for the until to of operators. Next week?
