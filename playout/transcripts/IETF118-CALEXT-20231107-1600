And in this session, now I would like to, get a common get us all on a common understanding on where we are with GS calendar based and, what would be the next steps that that we might take and now I need to figure out how to go to next page. So just a short recap. So We had published Chase calendar in 2021, in summer 2021. And a year later, we started working on Jay's calendar biz which basically was the result of us not publishing the JS calendar, I calendar conversion draft, together with Chia's calendar So when we continue working on the when we when we continued working on the converse conversion, we realized that there are a couple of gaps that we need to close. And mostly in scheduling, we found some of these gaps hard to close. Verr very shortly said, the semantics of scheduling in Chase's calendar are a superset of the ones in Icalendar. So we weren't sure how to best to either if if we should either use the semantics I calendar or if we should go with the ones of JS calendar and figure out how to prop that until I calendar. In 2022, then, we, in an interim, we made the decision to go with the expanded extended scheduling semantics of Icalendar And, started defining properties around it, but then, basically, she has took all the focus, and, we didn't sunder work on that."

I've been looking now, where we are with calendar is, and I've been so what you see here is the list of changes that we that we had made in, in addition to the already published, chair calendar, specification. Since it's a long time, I wanted to my own on my own get a better understanding of WER on what were these changes actually. As you can see here, quite a couple of them are basically just additions So this is All you see on this page of the changes is stuff that we could easily just, just bring it to Jay as Kevin, with an Ariano registry edition, we do not necessarily need to obsolete or even really update jscalendar. Although we might want to define a new RFC for some of these properties if they are, not basically trivial to, specify, but I think looking at them, I think all of them basically are. So think we wouldn't even need a new Internet draft for either of these changes. 10 Also quite a chunk of these changes really are clarifications and fixes to JS, to the JS calendar RFC. So looking at them, none of them really would, in my opinion, on themselves be be would warrant coming up with a new RFC document, some of the stuff we might even want to push into as a narrator, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. But basically, These are also is also stuff we could somehow just more document,"

    "text": "then there is there are a few changes which are renames, I've been told at an earlier meeting, think last year or so that, So, basically, I when I defined these renames, I was of thinking of what if we are coming up with a new specification for JS calendar anyway, we can just also rename a some stuff for consistency. I got, told by someone who implemented Chase calendar already that are not keen on just doing renames just for fun, and I take that I accept that. So this bit all these renames, basically, stuff could easily drop all together. I mean, it it it would make things probably a bit more consistent, but, I mean, It's not it's not much of a big deal. So then interestingly, only two things are left. And these are these are stuff that are really incompatible So they are really like the gist of what we identified to be an issue with the current JS calendar specification especially when it comes to Icalendar conversion. So The first one is this, the schedule ID, which was, the content of the discussions I had mentioned earlier, And when I look at them now, I think we can, come up with an ink, a compatible, a JS calendar compatible recognition or a chase kind of the incompatible definition. The JS calendar compatible definition is basically easy to define for GS calendar, but we it will make conversion to eye calendar a bit more brittle, So there are cases then where we don't really know at least I don't know off the top of my head, how we could convert them to Icalendar, but I think that would be even fine."

    "startTime": "00:24:01",
    "text": "But then the other, the other, the the the JS calendar incompatible definition would be a redefinition of some of existing properties, namely delegation, and member of properties of the participant, And then basically, we would have, I think we would have covered all cases of icon in the scheduling conversion both please take, with the disclaimer that, we would do some some more thorough testing a discussion of this, but I'm pretty sure that this is fine. The other, incompatible change, which we could also like sneak in as a compatible change to JS calendar is that the times on definitions that we define. Js calendar are kind of a pain, for edge cases where with regards to converting them to, we calendar components in by calendar. Namely, it's The first issue is really more of a redundancy issue is that at the moment, since an event defines its time zones, imagine you have a group of events, then each of them would need to define their own time zones, again, if there are custom time zones, so that's kind of redundant. But this also has another issue, like if you would come up with two times, so, custom time zone definitions in 2 different events in the same group. Have the same time zone ID, we just cannot map this to eye Canada, basically. So what we would suggest is, what I would suggest is that we mark the time zone's property for event and tasks is obsolete, in the Ayanna graduate street, and add this properly to group. And then basically, that's also something we wouldn't necessarily even need a new draft for. There is a some of stuff that I would like to bring to Chase"

    "text": "contact. Sorry. Took Chase Kender from Chase contact, though. And this is first versioning I think that the versioning that we defined for Cheah's contact I really hope it to be useful. It's certainly brings in more versioning semantics than we have for JS calendar, which I think we do don't have any at all at the moment so that would really bring value, in my opinion, secondly, I would also like to bring in that we can make the high properties, optional in Chase calendar, because it first, it really reduces the the, the amount of data, but also it's something I think it's it it's it's it just looks better. And I think for some developers that's, that's also value. And last but not least, I would also like to align the semantics of the patch object, that we had to that we had to redefine for chair's contact with regards to patching a assisting array members. For consistency, I would also like to bring this to chair's calendar but I'm not like, it it it's not a hard to require but I think it would be I think it would be better if at least these two formats are consistent anti chain map patch object definitions still are more restrictive. I see that yours is in the queue, and I think that's into far grade as I'm just at the last slide So looking at the at the looking at it where we are, which she has kinda, I would suggest this is just a suggestion. I think we could go forward like this. We register all the stuff that are identified forest, merely additions to Chair's calendar, we don't need wait for Chase calendar based. We just defined them now. We registered them at Ayanna, and, we will just need to come up"

I I would say after some more testing, I would suggest we go forward with the backwards compatible scheduled ID definition, that are outlined for Chase calendar and I think that's the only the hard requirement that we need to make chemic for calendars, scheduling, useful. And for any of the other stuff, we should we should come up with the GSK and the BIS then we are not as much in a hurry because we are not going to block, the main uses cases of the Jmap for tasks and jamiec for calendars. RFCs And if we define CHA's calendar based and we bring in the version from Chase contact as I had suggested, we might then later defy if we want to come up with, backwards compatible version 1.1 for JS calendar or 2.0 if we decide to break stuff, And, that's the end of my presentation. So Looking forward to your fitted Yauris and whoever is entering the queue. Yeah. This is Charles Palm. So I think it's very valuable to keep js calendar in sync with JS contact because they're both underlying data formats that are used in Jmab, like, that it doesn't make any sense to make have a different I don't. Structure, between those? Yeah. I'm not fully understanding the next steps here. Is Am I reading that or understanding that correctly that you want to You want to not include the schedule ID and this 1st version 1.0 And, No. Actually, the other way around.

And we should add the schedule ID where we have 2 options how to define it. The first one, the compatible one So the the thing here is that at the moment, the delegate from and to properties and the member of properties, are defined to to point to, participant ID in the same object. Whereas for that doesn't help still with converting to Icalendar because for Icalendar, we will require them that this participant must include a schedule ID property because this schedule ID property value is the cal address of the attendee or organizer in the I calendar data. So we in the in this in this in this compatible, change, which is just compatible to Chase Calendar, we might end up delegate that one participant dedicate to another participant in the same event, But if the delegate doesn't have a schedule ID, we cannot we cannot convert this information to Icalendar because we are missing the thing that allows us to to converting that. Think that's kind of an artificial issue because for every from Icalendartojscalendarconverted event, is not gonna have to happen ever. It's just for the way from Cheah's calendar to I calendar. And I mean, in in if if that's the case, then well, then there is just stuff you can't convert easily to IQ, and then that's just how it is."

You mean, for for what, for updating Kerindo, or for writing CHSKerindo Biz. Before I'm I guess, Both didn't I'll get that right. Okay. So, So for so neither is is blocking. It's just as always a matter of, of the time we have available to do that. But since time also is kind of a concern to me to, to, have Chase calendar defined as useful as possible, as soon as possible, to get more traction on the chain map specs that build on it, I think it's I would suggest it to first do all the quote easy changes to Chase calendar. And postpone all the stuff that might be better to have at some point where we are not under much pressure, come up with Cheah's calendar biz. That's my suggestion. Alright. Yep. Makes sense. Oh, please, Nick. Go. Yeah. And it's Neil. Just wanted to, I think, mainly been covered, but just making sure I understand with the schedule idea. I think the schedule idea is the only thing that really affects Jamapp calendars, in all of this. So the idea is we add the property, and that's just you said, a registration, and we can have a, maybe, a short document that defines these new properties that we're adding. But then we leave the, kind of type definitions for the delegated member of to point to the participant ID because that would be a breaking change"

    "startTime": "00:34:00",
    "text": "we change that. Is that the plan? Robert, just so I can clarify. That's correct. So, I would also say that we keep the non breaking when we add the schedule ID property to the current GS Canada specification, we will extend the definition of the of the delegated from property to say this points to a participant ID, actually, we did Sorry? Yes. It already does it. And this is kind of bringing, a bit of, of, like, it it makes things a bit more complicated with regards to Icalendar conversion because Yeah. If we if we wanted to have it watertight we would redefine the delegated 2 property to say it must point to this to the scheduled ID and not to some participant ID. But I think it's, I think the edge cases, each case we will would cover with that. Is not, is is not enough to bring in a breaking change. I agree. It's not important enough. And breaking changes about if we can avoid them, it would be great. Yes. That's also my opinion. Works for me, I think. So then, yeah, that should be easy to do, and that Jmap calendars is basically ready. So we just need to add Do do we want to add the schedule ID in the gym Jason, jamac calendars document itself, or maybe better to keep separate still if we're adding some other properties to, like, you We probably want a short document with all those properties you want to add as just like extensions to js calendar or something? We yeah. I mean, we are, we are having expert review, as the, registry change procedure. So it's up really up to us to decide if we want to come up with an RFC or if if the description field in the Ayanna property description is enough, but think we can Yeah.

We can actually go get the definition. 8 8 8 8 I would have to see how that sufficient documentation text, is phrased or if there is, like, experts, they would be the one to decide if that That's enough. It does not have to be, spec, like, RFC. Maybe a draft would be enough. But Yeah. It it's I can only give you, like, my personal opinion, but then it's the expert's opinion that matters deducting Right. Right. But in general, the problem with web page is that you there is, like, who who is maintaining that and, yeah, So adding to that, adding to that, this is also what we currently have defined in see in the Ayanna considerations, where I think there is a section advice for experts or something like that.

But what I can relate to the the idea of why would I want to implement this but not wait for, like, the real thing or whatever. Like, developers should just be accustomed that this thing would always evolve. I mean, that's exactly why we added a versioning scheme to Jay's contact, to make clear that there's always going to be new stuff, hopefully, because it's, people will find new use cases for that.

And series But once again, came up for me, I'd I'd like to I'd like to try and and, and and do something with that over the next few months. Me see if I a bit more done on that and resubmit it Oh, I'm gonna try and concentrate on on people So for the moment, then So to give it some time out and distant future. Oh, So the service side description gets subscription get to get adopted, or do we just just just leave it as a as a zombie. And you can let somebody drop But it goes in the data tracker. It stays as a expired. 6 bi document just leave it expired. I think it's it still has some some merit. It's just, There's nobody shouting for it. We can mark it as dead if we want just to so that it's clear that we're not working on it and it's not you know, overlooked but we're not cruel. That much curl in that working group."

This is Ben Bush. I'm been working on Thunderbird, and we been adding, the feature of HTML descriptions in the calendar That was a frequently requested feature by end users. Because they're getting meeting invitations from Microsoft teams, for example, which are very weirdly formatted with very long URLs in the plain text very unreadable. And, and the HTML looks really nice. So that's clearly the format that my of intended it to be looked at. And, that was a fairly common user request. HTML descriptions are obviously useful for many other things. If you want to make, put an admin meeting agenda. You can have bullets with lists, you have titles, you have much more ways to say what you wanna talk about doing that. Meeting. So we tried to add that and we ran into multiple problems. The main obvious one is that there's no clear specification about how to do that. So I can't remember whether in Ical description is specifically plain text, I believe it is. Yes. It it is. Okay. That's good. So that's doesn't work. And the result is they're they're a few other proposals, or things in the wild."

That's the first thing you find to how to do that. But apparently nobody is using that in the while that I could see apart from old Microsoft software or the outlook or something. And what most seem to be doing. They're just dumping HTML into the plain tag description. Which is obviously problematic because it's there's no clear way to know whether this is actually plaintext or HTML. I have to know that before I can display it because of new lines, how formatted, do I use fixed fix where do I use how do I display that? If it's plain text, I need to and in their new lines, it's HTML, I won't, have to use a parser So that's not clear. Google is doing that. So Google is just dumping HTML randomly into the description. The golden calendar. Sometimes it's plain text. Sometimes it's HTML. You gotta figure out what it looked at the event, but with style description, Sing in? The event speck has dialed the description, which is a is specifically for this. And it was, He was he was It was developed along with input from from Google. Is that I I don't I don't know this event pops back. Is that background. This is Ken, RFC 9073. It's, I calendar extensions, and one of the properties is style description exactly in this purpose. Okay. So Google doesn't seem to be using it, but, okay, that's that answers the question. Found something else in an old spec. The original spec actually had an alternative representative should for property alt rep."

    "text": "So in the description, Yeah. That that was that was really not. The and we looked about So can can I just finish, but I've found. So, so the So there was this this all draft. It is actually in the standard. And with an example, I kinda have I have an a description, property with a parameter of AldRAB contains the URL And the example that they make is an HTTP URL, which is obviously a problem. Beds, then we had the idea, hey. We could put a data URL in there. And the data URL contains the MIME type. What we're doing right now is we're putting description, Always is plain text, and then it has an alt rep equals data takes HTML and then the ML in there in line in the parameter of the description property. So that's what Thunderbird is doing right now. We were the only ones doing that as far as I know, next cloud, calendar, think is doing that now. There's also the problem between synchronization between the 2. So you don't want to have properties. That's what problem with the alts Excel desk because we had problem in Next Cloud. They were editing the description and then the HTML was out of sync, and we didn't know which one is the right one. So that property is that the parameter is better because if you edit the property, it's more obvious that you need to drop the parameter of that property that is out of thing. That's the status as I know right now. I don't know about the even style. So 6 The perimeter issues just the same, and people will ignore the parameter and update the description. So you you've really got the same problem."

The description property itself is is, is optional so you could have just a style description. So it sounds like we have a evangelism problem if if this is, you know, well known and opposite that people out there are using it So they just published in August one. So I really look really hard for that and then find that Right. There is but, you know, I think that's that's true in general. I mean, the number of times I find people still referring to 2554. Only last week in for so so It's it it's come. Yes. Yeah. This list that it updates 5545. So it should be fine. For the Madison up, but that's a little challenge. It's registered with IIM. It is what I ran over the street. Yes. It's their it's But Didn't did it? Am I understanding that correctly? The style description is another crop parallel to the Yes. Which is the that's not quite This is Kenzo that it may not be foolproof, but the style description can have a, derived parameter on it. So if you're trying to keep things in sync, You can well, like, correct me if I'm wrong, did it Does derive go on style description or just description? I forget which way we went with"

I think the description's property, it was thought they would go the other way around. You'd have a simpler fight description based on the base too. Yeah. That that's right. So, yeah, if you've got rich text and style descript and description you want, just have plain text and description You put that there, and then then Mark flag it as derived. So anybody understands the new property would would know that if have to update So what happens? So the the problem outlines which don't know about SARS description. Right? So they see description. They don't know about the device. They don't know what it is. So that's been going to be ignored. So they modify the description. So now I end up with the description. You have more situations to add a curve, though. Can can I finish my sentence and then Thank you. So we end up with a with a description which says b a style description which says, a, of them says derived, so you don't know what you which one to But what what what what situations does that occur in? I'm editing the calendar in Thunderbird, which supports supports the latest standard. Then I added the calendar in, let's say, Outlook or whatever client, which does not know about this. And, I synchronized the back calendar back. So I have 2 different use a clients, which both added that and then are not one or suspended the one that the other doesn't that does happen. I'm not making this up. I know it can can happen, but it's it's, it's the it's the same user using 2 different clients, isn't it? Yes. But that that is very common use I don't know how common that is. Yes. It's very common. Like, you have a web a face, in Google, And then you have Thunderbird, and then you have a mobile client. You have 3 land editing. I think you'll get the same effect with if somebody updates this to support a parameter, they can update it to support a proper mean, the the situation's the same."

Well, with the parameter, at least it's clear that the parameter needs to be dropped like a client that's editing a property needs to the parameters. They they won't unless they know specifically that it I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, 554 has to say, it says explicit So if they don't know about what it is, they'll just preserve it, and you'll be able to step with the description. So there needs to be some because that is a real bot. Like, I'm not making this up. This I know. But it's the same but it's it's but it's the same It's the same problem as a parameter or property I will try this with, I can't remember which particular a property. They they added some property somewhere that which was essentially a more complex version of something. I think it was their extended location. They tried putting, check sums in and the rest of it. If any with their own clients, It was an imperfect solution. It just didn't didn't work. You just have to Hope that people will move to the new thing. And implemented properly. That's that's that's part of the problem we have with with eye candor, whose way, arguably, very strongly for having a version and always updating it so people know that they're they are not, they are not fully supporting the So are you are you suggesting that every that that checked on being added because whatever we do needs to be interoperable. They they tried that, and it it just didn't work. I I all I'm saying is that I don't think there's any difference between a parameter and a property in the in in this sense in that they will get out of step. Either way. I I hear you, but I'm saying we need some kind of solution for that. The the solution is for people to support. The latest version of whatever it is. And and, make sure they they keep these things in step Yeah. I cannot control other client. I know. It's it's it's so important. I cannot change Google Calendar. But Right? 4th"

So there is a way to do that. You could do a description, which contains all the properties and including the HTML and including the tags. And then you define, you have to update both at the same time. Then the description is there for legacy purposes, and then it's basically a copy of that. And if you see that description is there and it's out of sync with a plain text version, of the start description, then you see that it was another client and you drop So there is a way to do that. It's just It did it did a clean. There was a clean one Yeah. Just gonna make the point that we need some something new, either as as you suggested a parameter property, but we've already got a property defined And I don't see where one is more preferable over the other. So let's just use what's already defined and and make it work. Correctly. None of which we can do without buy in form from the rest of the vendors, obviously. So I'm I don't care how it's called. I mean, it's it's obviously, of of problem if because we have certain things already deployed, right, and needs to be conversion. But whatever. A bit if we is supposed to use style description. We need to have both HTML and the plain text version in the scratch description so that I can see that this matches the description. So can I do both the style description, can I put both HTML and I don't why why do you need both in the same So, yeah, so that he can detect if it's chain if If a client updates just a plain description and doesn't know about star description, it won't update copy of it in there as well? So you can see they're different. Therefore, you can know that the the the Yeah. So the the the, I mean, the question here really is about how do clients handle things they don't understand? Because that and because that's how you make something more backwards compatible. We're at a time. It feels like this was writing up the west."

Other things that weren't meant for me to set this matter refreshing them, there we go, milestone is done in record time. We've finished exactly on time. Thank you very much, everybody. See you at Brisbane. When I see at the dinner in an hour, That's an f be way, you know, useable. So you can update us about some of us here rather correcting. And we need to get back to that.
