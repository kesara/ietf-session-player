Of what your obligations are as an It participant. In terms of Ip r and and other processes. So As always, let's just try to keep heart behavior professional in the meetings. Let's see. We don't have terribly full agenda, but we do have a bit of things to talk about. I think we already have note takers. Are folks in a chat there's somebody who can reflect Thanks you up. You all should also log in through the on site meeting tool if you're on site here, so your attendance gets recorded. So please do that as well. Can you hear me okay? K. Alright.

We go to next slide We have inter implementations for some definition of inter, and I'll I'll get to this a bit later. All the open rad have been addressed the document is in about as good as shape as as we know what to do. So next slide. Open issues. It looks like nobody has implemented the Pk portions. I'm presuming Elliott wants those to stay in. Which is probably a good idea. The question is whether we will have to go through another biz revision if we discover anything that's wrong in the document or will be implemented differently. I think some of the discussions about Pk are not is addressed a bit by some of the other open issues, which I'll come to later. There's also the request action issue as raised by Elliott, which still needs some discussion. If we go to the next slide, There's big issue with t. I've raised this on the list.

So you're stuck with either always doing e are always doing password and then hoping that the client will go no. No no no No. I don't wanna do that. I wanna do the other one. Which means at best you have a couple of extra rounds, which are useless. At worst the client gets a request. For password authentication says I don't wanna do this. And hangs up or gives a fatal error saying, no. No. No. I wanna do deep. How long you gonna take questions now? Sure. I'm happy to take questions now. Good morning, everybody janet Alan Thanks again for doing this document. Tell we are here. The woman issued. I I think This one, we looked at it, we said was, well, actually, you can make the decision based on how initial happens in tea.

It's not gonna be a machine if if if it So you you get a lot of hints based on on that Tls initial. And maybe one of the things we should do is explore that and maybe write some of that an un really hard coat. Alright. Thanks. Okay. So yes, if if you do get a client cert, in phase one, you have an identity and you know something about what to do. If you don't get a client cert in phase one, our tests were that it's possible for windows, for example, to do machine authentication in phase two using. So in the general case, Tee sets up a tls last tunnel. Between the sup and the server And then you had the server has no idea who it's connected to and there's no idea what to do after that. So, yes, there are cases where It does get some information. But in the general case, it does not. And so ...this is an open issue. So this is what I mean when I say, there are inter implementations.

So that's something which could be addressed. The other thing, and this is coming from my discussions with people implementing this as part of policies, how do you know what the other end wants to do or what the other end has. So let's say The server says I want everyone to do machine and user authentication. But the sup is only configured with machine authentication are only configured with. User. There's no way to signal that in advance other than The server proposes one and the client says no. Right? Ideally what should happen is the client should tell the server I'm capable of doing these things, hopefully also with some identities for each one, And now the server has the appropriate information to make a decision. As opposed to the server gets a connection and the server goes. Let's try to do machine authentication. That didn't work. I guess, let's try to do user authentication. Maybe with passwords. This is this does not provide a good user experience. And makes debugging and policies very, very, very difficult. So next slide, So what actually happens with windows there's a bit of text here.

Which presumably is a signal that it doesn't have those credentials tools Arguably, if you look at the list of errors in the spec there is no error saying, I don't have those credentials. An error credentials are unavailable but is that it's not able to get them or does it mean I haven't been configured with them? And this is shipping in pick a number hundred million devices. Right? So now all the servers have to be updated to look for this empty identity and recognize it and verify in fact that, yes, this m identity means that those credentials Don't exist. I was trying to do user authentication. But now those credentials don't exist. So now it has to decide whether two reject the system for violating policies because the server wanted to do machine plus user, or doesn't wanna let the user on the network.

It's not that And you said we have a an error tl b for credentials unavailable or? Okay. But there there's there's no description of what that means other than it means credentials unavailable. Does it mean you know, maybe that could mean that I asked the user for the credentials and it timed to when you tried to enter them, or I tried to get them from a one time password system. And that fail. Right? There's there's a difference with between unavailable and does not exist. I have no such information why is that an important difference? I mean, if they're unavailable they're unavailable, because it or what the reason is. Perhaps not. But I I I I would argue that needs to perhaps a little bit of clarification. And some out of pushback against implementations going If you can't do something, please send an error there's an error Tl l defined with you know, twenty values. Please send an error rather than just silently doing some very odd thing. So I I guess this and the previous issues I talked about get into what do we wanna do with this document?

It should be attached to a request action frame any. Or were in front of a request action frame. For a Pk ten request. And that way, the client gets the Csr attributes alongside, hey, it's time to renew. And there may be other time that it can be sent like at the beginning of a transaction then I think we discussed this a little bit on the list.

So Yeah. The sooner, you know, The sooner we can get text and and resolve kind of outstanding behaviors around the request action Tl, the better because that's one of the issues.

Is there anybody here who would like to comment on that issue and whether I know Elliot you already did, Is there anybody else who you know, wants to comment for against doing This identity piece. To to differentiate between machine austin and user auth Yes. So so the question is, do we want to add another Tl v for this and perhaps also for the client to signal what it has available. Even if nobody implements it. Because if it's there, we can upgrade the implementations to use it. And it will just be better. Don't think it's that complicated. I mean, really, it's it's the proposal I had to the list was the client sends to the server a Tl, which is identity hand and it has some identity and now the server can decide what to do with that.

Right? And take what it would take what actions, it decides. One of the things that we should be considering is if we add it, we should just add a little bit of discussion as to the trust that one that the server might or might not put into that. But I don't think that's a lot of text. I think it's probably a with a small paragraph. And that's going For me, that's why I wanted to call it identity hint because if you get an identity that's not part of Ep or not part of the big password off, they could be different. Right. And now all kinds of bad things happen. Whereas if you call it an identity hand You know what? It's a hint if the actual identity you see in basic password, or Eat is different too bad The hint is only used to select eat or password.

A little bit background scene there has been quite much interest or in e in new industries, especially in Iot and also in in 5g is now a major essential part of 5g can be used for prime authentication or secondary authentication. Authentication, access authentication and secondary or authentication it's on the application layer of the afterwards. And both of these can use any method. What's missing is a lightweight eat method. Yeah. For constrained Iot.

The difference is the massachusetts isis four Tls with Rp yes. The Tls not the thing is eight hundred bytes. Massachusetts for Ad hoc is around hundred bytes. So drastic the reduction.

The idea here is that we, you know, usually this credentials once it's even bus bootstrap. Right? One is deployed. They tend to be very static. And one things that that we are looking into, especially in some use cases that we see and convergence projects that we are running also you know, Wifi Wired and 3g type of networks. Be could be very useful to have a policy that that allows you to define get me this security level and then forget about everything else. And so Ip comes in and and basically does the then all those activity that usually we've nobody already likes to do and try to connect with renewal if you certificates try to renew your your password with the password services that that you have. And the is that allows you to keep the same level of risk level, right, You know, define whatever your policies. In those credentials that tend to be, you know, not your application per, not your boots bootstrapping credential. Those are the in the middle that are provisioned when the devices on the on network, for example on online. And those are usually very very difficult to manage.
