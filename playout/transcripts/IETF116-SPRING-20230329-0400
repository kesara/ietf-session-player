Because it a similar the cc system program At the problem High level you're saying, but the the is different. But different because why for Mp? Why for S sr six So it's kind the same, but in detail is different because in the Sr mt mp, and then we can change the the stack But for Half v six, we cannot attach to at spec can only use the cab or whatever, heads the trigger there. Hey. I'm just understand for for two a different solution. But in my opinion if this is the same problem, it's probably easier to address in this working to have consistent feedback Yeah. Great. Maybe it's because it's the same problem and in same group and also maybe merge and then have one one one draft and then just have stop sections one for as I less on one for s v six, that's also possible. Yeah. That's that depends on The author people's opening. Yeah. I'm open.

We can we we can figure that out, but let's get some comments on the document. On the mailing list for sure run Lewis. Yeah. Luis from J Networks. So I think if I'm not wrong, in this p one operation the pi router, we'll drop the first label b n. Right? If I'm wrong and then for it to be q one. Am I correct? I mean, in this slides, right? One is doing the actually, the dropping of the first I mean the top one. Right? That's it The see for the field note. And yes. I think this is the how works. But the problem actually, if the end is the Ab or the barrel reporter routers. P one have no ability to kill maybe. Right? Is a problem maybe. Means from p to q it must be good for n.

So here there is this context Id thirty and the contact side, if you contact id authorities allocated for C e one, which is p three, p four primary and p three is a, whereas context id fifty is for p four and p five. So the traffic is being sent from p one, it would use the context Id thirty if you is c one's traffic, and it would use a context Id forty fifty if it is c traffic.

And also defines what is a context table wherein, you know, when... You know, the the other P, the second p construct the context table, like, this all the service labels that are allocated by primary p would also be put in this context table in in the second pe so that when the protection traffic arrives, protected traffic arrives.

Many times these services are virtualized, and they are not servers, and they may be moving based on availability of memory and Cpu.

So the p three has to receive the same prefix from C one, and it also received Receives the same prefix from p four via I advertisement and that that kind of condition is used to detect multi homing of this prefix from between p four p three and p four. So the requirement is that for to participate in auto edge protection is that they should all have this pre provisioned any cost address pools and index pools, and they should not conflict between each other. So if that condition is satisfied then p three and p four can participate in in the auto age protection. Next slide, please.
