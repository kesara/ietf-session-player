One example is the 5G antenna that's opposite of my home in Oslo the middle of a city, and serves my phone, which which I don't see any benefit at all Nobody I know would see any benefit There are, of course, other reasons to deploy 5G There are many other things in there, you know, Slicium can get it you hardware reuse, but I'm talking about the actual capacity upgrade that may often be meaningless I see two major reasons for too much capacity being rolled up but I'm talking about the actual capacity upgrade that may often be meaningless. I see two major reasons for too much capacity being rolled out. One is simply over-provisioning Over-provisioning was what, from my perspective, killed quality of service, at least one of the things that killed it in the 1990 as a major model. It was similar and cheaper to roll out more capacity It also helps resilience. Maybe even today most likely, even today is probably the cheapest way to make a network resilient by just rolling out more links and not fiddling too much with traffic"

Could there be ways to make these things cheaper? reducing the risk cost for manpower somehow? reduce the risk somehow I don't know that but I'm wondering, you know, from a point of view of a service sustainability, I'm not sure if this is the right way to go We've been going like that for decades, right? but yeah and then the other thing is congestion control and application demands I already mentioned 5G on the cell phone as opposed to fixed wireless access or things like that, which, you know, may then the other thing is congestion control and application demands. I already mentioned 5G on the cell phone as opposed to fixed wireless access or things like that, which may have an absolute justification But for instance, on the cell phone, it's very hard to notice a difference between 4G and 5G for any practical application. I do see a difference if I decide to offline offline down a difference between 4G and 5G for any practical application. I do see a difference if I decide to offline download a movie, which I never do over a cell, cellular that's not a fantastic use case. I think for most applications it seems pointless Most transfers and in Slow Start, that is already quite well-known fact. These are just a couple of data points from different papers one that we've met where we we carried out measurements looking at retransmissions so you know you would normally assume a retransmission happens after slow start. Of course, you could have things like high start getting in the way but generally in our data set in other data sets we we're talking 80, 85, maybe 90% of connections finishing in slow start, which means that they never even, potentially, they don't even get anywhere close to the capacity that is available that is available. And we're just having many of these flows you know, coming and going and yeah like, you know, like a big, fat, empty road"

This is using a token bucket so not exactly 100% realistic in how it's limiting, but the general trend will be the same. What do you see? is that the median page load time in the plot below, of course it goes down as you change from 500 kilobit to one megabit to 10 megabit where you see a significant difference but what you also see is that it flattens above a surface value the difference becomes pretty small and if we do just a very basic axle sheet calculation, right, saying what happens if I send 10 packets or what happens if I send 10 10,000 packets over a link with 8 milliseconds? and you change the capacity? and you consider the serialization delay as a opposed to also the end-to-end delay that you just have from the link then it just flattens. I mean, it's something that is unavoidable At some point, you know, you have eight milliseconds plus basically nothing, and you increase from that to eight milliseconds plus even less of basically nothing right? So becomes just a round trip time therefore capacity upgrades really have a limited speed benefit the benefit will be there if the lengths of connections would scale at the same value, I mean at the same speed at which the capacity would also scale. And if we were not also limited by round trip times in transport protocols So again, factor of X requires the data use growth of factor X at least, right? Also the protocols would have to go along"

That's related to how often do we use it, how what kinds of applications are we using, how many people are using it, all these kinds of things Not necessarily one application traffic is growing inside which it may not do that quickly. So what I click and I have I have more to support this but this is just a short overview, right? What I claim is that physical capacity is really not the bottleneck anymore, mostly. Capacity upgrades hardly improved latency. Applications to all not demand more capacity, right? You may be dreaming of holograms as people do for 6G and so forth, but the applications really lack behind. And also, if you just take this into the future and you start thinking, this is why I've been mentioning 7G here on this top slide, you know, if you think beyond 6G, if they say 7G, seven G, eight G, nine G, where is this going? Right, we're getting high and higher and higher capacities and they're going to be emptier and emptier and emptier it's a strange trend and not necessarily a sustainable one There are many arguments for why under load exists for why it's like that. You know, you can read one of these two pages or both of them if you want. There are many arguments in these papers also for why congestion control will actually become increasingly worse, saturated in the capacity so it's not you know the country the many arguments in these papers, also for why congestion control will actually become increasingly worse, and saturating the capacity. So it's not, you know, you can't just scale the parameters, you cannot simply scale up the initial window forever.

There's got to be a sweet spot where it makes sense to upgrade I don't know if people if this is the 10-year cycle of 5G to 6G and so forth, for instance, is that sweet spot And then there's also a question about wired networks in the same way And if I'm right, and we really should do fewer hardware updates, then there are questions like how would we convince the industry. I mean, I'm sure with that talk, I get a lot of love from people working on my massive mymo and things like that right? So lower layer folks will not be happy to stop upgrading capacity I guess the biggest question for me and the reason to really go around and start talking about that is how to convince funders to put money into this That will be my biggest question like focusing on congestion control again and on the understanding that under load is an actual problem, we should better use available capacities rather than rolling out new ones And if this is a sustainable benefit, how would one measure this? I'm clueless And that's already it. These are my questions That's what I would like to discuss Thank you, Michael. Tolus, go ahead Well, I mean, one simple data point against it is if you look at a one RU slot somewhere in a pop of a service program, or a data center, the amount of energy that you can cool away there and that's being used has been pretty constant whatever generation of hardware is in there and they've just been getting faster and faster, right?

So production cost of the hardware and then, you know, the green energy costs over the lifetime of the new versus the old hardware I think that's the comparison ultimately and I think you'll, you'll see that because I mean, we may not have the green energy, but all these things are priced in typically, right? so the upgrades are typically afforded, it's just that the energy that we're using is is bad energy right so otherwise I think hardware upgrades are typically always afforded by you know, the money that they're making with it more. Even, yeah, of course, the average utilization of these things goes down and the peak utilization goes up that's what you budget the hardware that you buy for what's the fastest hardware that I can afford for peak you utilization so to speak that's the best service I can provide And so ultimately, I think it's a lot what's the fastest hardware that I can afford for peak utilization so to speak that's the best service I can provide and so ultimately I think it's it's a lot you know more important to try to get more energy proportionality with the through in the newer network hardware especially something which we already have in most of the server hardware, which is 90% of a data center right so really already have in most of the server hardware, which is 90% of a data center.

So it's not that somebody is using 20 gig per second, but you're trying to put like way more people. So if you take an example of India, right? this is operator which didn't exist 10 years ago right like you know who's like common has like probably 300 million or 400 million customers, right? So they are really trying to squeeze like, more people into the same thing So like so what like the capacity increases just funding like our making it commercial feasible to have more number of users for the same amount of spectrum because the governments have realized that spectrum is something they can sell for a lot of money for all there like budgeting things right so I think that is probably another angle you need to look at it so like a lot of the upgrades even though some people think it's flippant right like to kind of increase this thing it's not for one user it's really for like more users like to get connected onto the internet. So I just wanted you to think of that angle of looking at things too thanks I'm Suresh just told what I wanted to say and it's kind of very interesting especially when we say that especially in your slide when you said like 5G do you feel the difference?

So, and in fact, like, you know, even there is a data to back like it's only 15% of the population that still uses 5G but amount of data they're downloading amount of the usage the quality of user experience that they get is very, very different another unique point is that many people are mobile only, that that is the only way that they connect to the internet.

You make cells I mean, you make towers smaller and smaller and smaller You connect more people, but I mean, there's probably going to be a limit at some point of the point in increasing capacity further and further. That's what I am mean, you know. And also, if you think of the use cases right, up until 4G, they made sense. Sorry but I mean, you had use cases like video conferencing and things like that that really matched the application that's happening right for 5G we were going a little bit sci-fi with, you know, with remote operation and things like that like you have a surgeon but the surgeon doesn't own the fiber cable he wants to be out in the woods and do it things like that right so these things i think appear because you try to justify somehow, you know, what you doing, but the application isn't really there And this will probably become worse as we have 6G.

I at least personally feel like at home I have a gigabit interface but I don't feel like I get the gigabit experience And I think I attribute that to a lot of large extent client issues or server site issues.

Ali, bye empty Thanks very much. Thanks very much for your call I really appreciate that multiplexing should be effectively used. But as colleagues have already said things are different in different parts of the world. So we have to look at the context and the use case before deciding. But about necessity there is also the other dimension You're looking at the access network that one subscriber is potentially served by multiple providers That's also like you get signal from three, four operators There are parallel networks operating at the same time. That's also really a wasteful use of resources. It's huge that one network is underutilized, but there are multiple networks on underutilized. So what can we do about that? as well? Infrastructure sharing Then you're focusing on the access network Typically in access networks, multiplexing rates are not huge, like in fixed and same mobile. But what about the core?

And that's an issue because it's, very easy to keep increasing the network capacity, as Michael just argued, we tend to do that a lot but it gets harder and harder to improve energy efficiency so we need to progress because more energy requires more electricity, electricity comes from carbon sources still primarily today. Okay, now we all know this. If we do things naively, the networks state up all the time, that consumes a lot of electricity That's an issue. I'm going to go a bit quickly there because I think most of you in this room know this Network device is always on Their power profile tends to be kind of flat.

The point I want to make is that, of course, we want to strive for more proportionality. How can we do that? Well, we can do that by either running at higher utilization or we can try to do some sleeping options. We can turn off a certain number of things in an hour network. I go through those things quickly to go to today's main point. We try to do a study on putting links to sleep right? Why links?

You can perfect packet and then wait a bit, sleep through link, then you send your burst of packets in one go That doesn't work today. That doesn't work because we cannot turn all the link fast enough.

Then among the load, sorry among the links that are lowly loaded, we can select some that would be fine to put to sleep. I will explain what I mean by that in a second You turn those to sleep, you instruct the power of command. And if you should have an increase of utilization in your system, that is somewhat unpliant, either due to a failure or to whatever sort of flash crowd event, then your controller can wake up your links. You may suffer from sporadic congestion that will be resolved as soon as a the link or backup. The only tricky thing, in this, in this description is how to select the links to can turn off. And again, we try to go for the simplest way possible. So we took all the links in a network prioritized the low utilization links So we rang the links by their current utilization rate. We defined a maximum budget of traffic we allow to be rerouted by the process of turning links off We verify that we don't create local botanics and we of course verify that we don't break the network connectivity And if you just follow those simple Euristics, we found that on the two networks we could study, we turn off about one-third of the link And this one-third, if you see the data on the graph, that shows the number of links that can be turned off in the entire network is capped right? It looked capped. Well, this gap is actually this spanning tree in the network. So one more link would be disconnecting the network. So effectively, what it means is that in every nighttime in the lowest utilization, possible of the network, only one path is enough to carry entirety of the traffic"

We can discuss that later if you're interested There are more details to the how we do this and some subtleties and so on. We presented this recently We can talk about this more if you're interested The key question we had was okay, we can do this. It actually works. It does not create congestion as far as we can see But how much can we really save by doing that? It's still kind of tricky to assess this, but one thing we can do is to look at the transceivers that are effectively being deployed in those networks and get power not numbers for those and then multiply the two together and get an estimation of how much we would save. Unsurprisingly, if we turn off a doubt one-third of the link, we'll save about one-third of the power budget of the transceivers, right? we would save. Unsurprisingly, if we turn off the doubt one-third of the link, we'll save about one-third of the power budget, of the transceivers. And of course, this is only a fraction of the total power draw of the entire network How big is the transceiver power relative to the total network power? Unfortunately, as of today, we don't have a way of saying of answering this. It would really depends if you look on a per device budget, if you have a small switch that doesn't throw much power, then the transfer power is going to be a very large fraction of the total If you have a very big core rudder that have I don't know, many, many fans and a lot of processing units, it might not be that much. It's kind of unclear as of today Second, um, second point is that if we turn links off, we will save more than a transceiver power. There will be some power saving also on the router side. So in the internal route components. We know this because we've observed this in the lab but those are still pretty hard to quantify So we"

So external parameter that you plug it into, the power supply unit, and then you get the data out One side benefit of this, then we can get very high time granularity so we can observe the power effect of traffic bursts and things like that in the reading, which you typically will not get through SNMP data or young data So ultimately, what we want to do is create a database of all this sorts of information and yeah this is something that is currently ongoing Once we have this data, we will be able to build our models for a router or switch which is pretty basic. There is no major very fancy in there. That's also some data, we will be able to build our models for a router or a switch, which is pretty basic. There is nothing very fancy in there.

We did our best to estimate where the traffic would go if we were to turn links off So we have sensible intuition that we do not generate, we do not induce congestion, but we don't yet have proof of that or validation of that I'm discussing now with people at Orange and people in Swisscom to eventually try that on a share of their network If you're interested in that as well please feel free to let me know I'll wrap up now to leave as much time as possible for discussion There are a few more slide in the slide pack.

I think that's like a concern and how you would use the results for that. So I think it could be an interesting place, probably for the IABG next time to kind of go pitch that. The IABG is like a set of operators kind of who meet on IETF Sunday. Okay. Is that similar to right meeting or? No, it's like, it's more the operators will come to the IETF, right? Like so there's like a slide, there's like overlap from the right meeting or Nanak meeting or Appnick meeting, but it's like people kind of are interested in IETF stuff. So that's pretty interesting, yeah And this, you know, the baseline that you kind of base this on right like how stable is it like over time right because I think these things can stay like stable for a long time.

It's definitely a interesting crowd and some of them are willing to put those boxes in their network, it seems Thank you. Toulos Yeah, so one of the unfortunate problems is that of large numbers, right? So in a data center, 90% of the energy consumption comes from servers, 10% from the network So guess how interested the data center? operators are to optimize energy consumption of the network, right, if they instead could go for the network problem.

If you go mobile, it's even worse, but even you know, all the power for all the DSL lines DSL stuff on the edge and all these switches for tens of millions of users easily exceeds what's in the core So that also means you need to look at the topologies and the very limited redundancy that you have on the edge right? So in the US for a long time, you simply had a ring. So you were connecting, you know, 10 million and only one of the links could ever be down or else you would lose connectivity. Now, if you go to more densely populated areas like the US or even here, the big cities, you may at best have hub and spoke with dual connectivity, so yeah, you may be able to take one of the links down, but unfortunately, you know, we don't even have the technologies over fiber right now to basically say, oh, what happens? if the other link then fails right how do we recover right in in the animal stuff that we've been doing we've been saying that, well, if you can have an in- what happens if the other link then fails? How do we recover? In the anima stuff that we've been doing, we've been saying that, well, if you can have an in-band management channel still running, then we could still bring up, you know, the link that we switched off the data path for and in actual, you know, non-IP optical equipment, there are these type of channels that are very low low-powered. But in routers, we typically and I forgot all these strange abbreviations from ITU and IT ICCE, they have crazy things at the optical level which I'm actually quite yeah, would love if we would have them going into routers but in routers we don't, right? So, I mean, if you switch off physically, the optics transmitter in a DWDM interface there, there is no way that you signal something to the other side.

Thanks, Roman Very helpful, I think one thing I want to add on the data center versus telecom network comparison is about virtuization I guess, level of virtualization cloudification in data centers is much higher than in telecoms although it's increasing. And that helps optimize resource use So that's one thing And also, as TORL said, the distributed nature of technology versus rather centralized as far as one data center is concerned it's really helping say a lot of resources, energy and else. One thing the title of your presentation, triggered in my head was I thought also we could look at what's keeping the let's say, links or nodes up What are the protocol features? characteristics that are not letting equipment sleep? If we can handle that in a let's say, systematic way, perhaps we get some benefits as well. Like what are the keep alive things, signaling as Torlo said, even at physical? layer?

So I think that'll be really cool roles if you can send it over at some point okay So we didn't study energy actually, so we did study how much privacy and for a purpose information, personal information is being distributed by those protocols Yeah, thank you. Thanks I have one question on, I mean, initially your assumption was to evaluate the average link you utilization on the switch wondering if you were considering that switch can have, I'll say, links for the same, let's say, reachability destination, and whether we can, you see thinking beyond the first up of the switch to say, OK okay if we have to look for next ops then we can maybe concentrate traffic over one link and then also turn off multiple links that go in the same to which different destination yeah i see what you're saying um so we don't do that at the moment. So we do look at so there is an easy thing to do is that when you have bundle lengths so you have multiple parallel physical lines that connect the same two routers then you can optimize a bit this. So you can optimize the bundles so that you keep the number of links you need between those two endpoints. But they are local right? They are direct neighbors. You could envision to do something similar by taking like one hub neighbors or, I mean, two hop neighbors, depending on how you look at it We don't do it as of now. In principle, there is not hop neighbors or, I mean, two hub dangers, depending on how you look at it. We don't do it as of now. In principle, there is nothing that prevents you from doing that.

And I think that would be probably more useful. They're trying to optimize in a way which of the links you turn off. If one would be to optimize this, then I would most likely try to optimize for power so you would try to turn off the links that draws the most power and for that that has essentially that means that are the more power-hungry optics Thanks, Romaine.

And then also there is adaptation, which is how do we keep it? going, given the climate change is happening? And that's really the question that I wanted to throw out And to be honest, this is a result of Yari. It's right asking, can we think about topics that are out of the box? or different or things?

There's also larger storms, erosion that happens Now, some of this, in this particular case, may be somewhat simple, you know, and simple, you know, in one way And there was a, when a tsunami hit, I believe, it was Japan, when they were coming back and restore systems after that, they were just going back and moving the cable landing stations at 50 meters higher. You know, those were perhaps some things that could be solved but it is a question, what happens to those areas Destruction of infrastructure, just a little bit sound of you right now in Oregon, in the United States there's large-scale wildfires that are affecting communities in place that are affecting the infrastructure, the pieces are there. We just saw, as I mentioned here, Hurricane Barrel hit Jamaica. Extreme heat this past Sunday was the day ever until Monday. So we are seeing that, and that creates immense demands for cooling for you know, places, homes, buildings hotel centers, everything that's out there, you know creating severe electrical demands. We're also seeing drought, water, cooling issues that are coming into place with this So the question really sort of is, you know, how do we adapt the internet? to be more climate resilient? And if you look at some of the different issues so much of this comes down to energy and electricity, power infrastructure deployment. Generally, we've just thought about the internet in terms of that the electricity is there for the most part So how do we work, how do we think about it differently? Many of the efforts are out there. You see community connectivity, you know, CN's community network internet bait, you know, internet exchange points, helping build local resilience.

From the network management research group perspective, we have also some reflection on, we call it green networking, but I think your point on the resilience and survivability can also be taken into account from a management point of view I mean, a few years back, we've been looking into a so-called autonomous networks, where this, I mean, robustness, and survivability is also a key characteristic So I will say from the software part or a little more the logical part, if the infrastructure is a bit up again"

What I want to say is that to a large extent, the challenges you describe have been experienced somewhere in the world already. Like when we talk about the internet in some parts of the Africa or even we saw in the Gaia session how Indian or as they called it but native American residents are including or building internet and the challenge they are facing. So these challenges are already faced with certain communities I know is helping them already So the idea is this is becoming a main mainstream topic now. But we can already look for the coping methods of these disadvantage communities. And this is bringing the inequality side of the things.

It's not an area for the IETF IRA or TFIB. So, and that's fine. I think we just have to ask that question and be conscious about it. And I see a Q So another aspect, we also deal with climate change adaptation and what we see is that the problem might be a little bit technical, but it is more on the solution side basically how do we bring different technology? enablers components together to solve a use case? in climate change adaptation?

Can you hear us? okay so i'll take you out the Q queue let romaine go and then you can try again okay thanks can you guys still hear me yep okay uh thanks ali for the presentation. I just wanted to bump back on both what I presented and what I think we should primarily work on I presented this work on turning links off and there's some art argument in the discussion that that might not be saved the most I actually agree with that. We started looking at this just from an academic curiosity of people saying, it's worth it, it's not worth it. And we're kind of like wondering at the end of the day, how much could we save by doing that? Do I think this is the main driver and what we should be working on? No. I think it should be worked on. I don't think it's the most urgent and the most promising avenue and and what I think is most promising as of today is the search for more levers for proportionality in today's network. And I think this will not come from the protocols. This will come from the hardware. This will come from better use of the hardware we have today and better design of tomorrow's hardware. And when I say better design, I mean design with more proportionality in mind That would be my answer to your question Thanks. Yep, I appreciate that Although I think we have some software impact as well for energy proportionality Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, what I presented is like one tiny part of that, right? There's something that can be done in software, but I think we won't get 10x improvement with just software, or at least not at protocol layers but more at the driver layer with final"

    "text": "control of the hardware we have Yep, thanks Thank you. I'm also looking right now I think I can go next Sorry, for the audio issues Thank you for the presentation. I just want to make a note, right? You were considering the energy consumption getting the right metrics on a popular frequency Maricio, the audio is coming into muffled Can you get slightly closer to your mic? Okay. Is now better? It's perfect Okay Yeah, I just want to make a note on the right metric that Ali was highlighting and I think it makes sense as well with other comments that we have done in the past on the call You talk about the scope and rarity and frequency the consistency on the metrics is key because I think this is where IETF can make a difference, you know, as a problem for the green bov I think we can bring some clarity as well from the technical point of view and be able to compare apples to apples. And the other point I want to do to make here on the energy and when we talk about carbon, operations people is not part of those conversations in organizations today right this is that by advisory. It is done by third party that validation and they are in another world, right? We are not comparing the same metrics when we talk about carbon and the energy consumption because they always say it's made values that are far from the region And I think these conversations could come closer if we can try to make an effort as well on the metrics definition. Yes, yes, absolutely But I think we need to make an effort to"

    "text": "create metrics for carbon as well I agree totally agree. Sorry I agree with that. Oh, thanks absolutely. Thanks for yourself Yeah, I just wanted to agree with Romaine on this energy proportionality being a high priority but I just wanted to slight disagree what you Romaine had said about that being a implementation issue or sort of a hardware issue yes, like 99% or 99% but there are some areas where standards and sort of set technology also matters like in radio networks we know what frequencies you have to listen and to how often how you schedule things that does affect the possibilities of when you can actually go to sleep. So that's important, too. Yeah perfect thank you and Perfect, thank you. And we are really at the end of this meeting, so thank you everyone for making this early start like you know we at the end of this meeting. So thank you everyone for making this early start. Like, you know, it was like an excellent set of presentation and great discussion And we'll continue on the list And so we kind of want to have this like once in a while, we meet in person but we really want to meet mostly virtually and off the IETF cycle so like keep the topics coming what are we you want to talk about we'll schedule a meeting when we have a set of topics and again go enjoy your any bar working group you're heading to so the digital ambulance looks really awesome so thanks thanks very much"
