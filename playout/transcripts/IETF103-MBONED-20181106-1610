McBride table for one it\u0027s crazy that\u0027s just funny all right so this is a document that has had a major rewrite in the last six months prior to the previous ITF we did not update it for this ITF but we thought we\u0027d just give it a quick overview so that hopefully other people either want to be a co-author or can just review it "
