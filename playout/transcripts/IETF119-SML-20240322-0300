I hope everybody in this room of watching the recording, I have noted a note well well, including the IPR policies and code of conduct, Okay. Okay. So We're using mute echo. We this session is being recorded. We have a note taker. Thank you, Pete. Agenda. So with Hans York's agreement. I reshuffled the agenda a little bit to start with vacation notices and use cases so that we kind of form up a little bit. And area director wants to save. Just just one quick announcement. Aren't Gil Branson has volunteered to assist a chair. He will start I'll I'll point him after this meeting. So like, no change right now. I'm looking for anyone who might want to assist further as Alexis was expressed more interest in attacking this problem from the floor than from the chair. So We'll be like this for a little while, but, I'm looking for a vault here."

Yeah. So I I'm very pleased to help Anteser. Future cochair. Yeah. Unfortunately, you have to leave. Before the end of this before the session. So He's not here. Right. So any objections to going location notices, use cases, and then go into the main spec and trust. Documents. And I think I'm going to be slightly flexible with times if of We'll try to spend more time on the main core document after use cases. But if we spend if you're making enough, you know, taking a bit more time for the main document, we can you know, shortened that security and trusts, section on, and we'll see how it goes. Right. With that, Let's get locations. Yeah? 1st. Yep. Test. Test. Alright. Welcome, everybody. To our 2nd ever ex SML, formal SMS working group session here, And, as Alex said, I think we do it quite similar to Prox that we start with, very particular use case, which is, email specific in a way And that is, structured vacation notices.

And, basically, what has been done or what has changed since the last IETF meeting in Prague. So there were some minor fixes in the document. There's 2 little bit larger things that were done. So one is about, use case is similar or related to vacation notices, we will come to that later. And a small section about on how to implement this, in the document. I'll also talk about this a little bit. And there is now also an, first implementation of that. So in case you wanna have a look, how's that looks in codes, you can see here as a GitHub URL. And so there will also be some screenshots, in the presentation. So you probably might already get an idea Next slide, please. Alright. So this is just a a slide for those of you who are probably not that familiar with vacation notices as such. So this is typically a standard feature of many email clients, systems, wet mail systems. One interesting thing, if you look at it a little bit is set the IETF specs, don't really cover a lot in terms of vacation notices. So it's mainly a feature which is which has never been fully specified to a certain extent. The only exception, beyond some side notes and some RCs is actually, of course, SIF, action of a vacation notice, which is mentioned here, RFC, 5230. However, if you look at it, it's more like the action. So it doesn't even, define or less, like, so conditions under which you apply is a vacation notice in many systems, obviously, is a date, where you say I'm on the from this and the state."

But, probably it's not what the typical user is doing. And this is a little bit important for this draft because, of course, it leverages a little bit, kind of sift rules that are outside practice. Yeah, think everybody of you probably who is using email has seen one of the other of these in the past. So you, you know, especially now people are here on IETF, you get a message from people an auto reply when sending them an email, which says, well, I'm basically on vacation. I'll be back next week, talk to my colleague if you need something urgent, things like And, obviously, this is something you need to read by yourself. And you need also decide on how to act upon And this is what makes it, I think, a good, example use case. Next slide, please. Because the idea is, this is actually some information which in most cases is very well structured because the things you've write in your vacation notice are basically, that that define your vacation notice is actually the time frame when you are away. Probably somebody else to refer to in case people need an emergency contact, things like that. And so it could be, or it's an easy win in some ways that you try to formalize this a little bit and, then clients could be enabled to actually, you know, provide some assistance to users based on that information and users would not need necessarily read, the manually written text. Yeah. And we will also see some examples of how that could be leveraged in the next slide. Alright. Alright. So this is a current proposal for, case in LD, structured data representation of such a vacation notice. Or out of office, how it is, mentioned here. You see there is a start in the end date."

And so I've seen where you can actually specify that. So it's typically in days, there is is forwarded, which means basically that you can say, you might have noticed the phrase in many of these messages, like, will it be forwarded to somebody else, or will nobody read your email while you send it. And there is also a notion here of a potential replacement persons how it's kind. So I'm not even sure if this is a very good understandable name, so there's, proposals accepted for better naming. If that's unclear for some case, but the idea is these are persons, one can address in replacement for the person who is absent in order to proceed with matters. And for these persons, one can basically define is there an email or a phone? Obviously, all of these things with respect to replacement persons are also optional. And finally, there is, a very short written additional note the user can add. Yeah, so that's basically how it is right now. Next slide, please. And, this actually a vcard representation. It's not really in the core of a draft because it's actually the way we implemented it in a reference implementation on the side of the, sender, like So I get back out of office vacation notice from somebody And, of course, in order to do further things with that in the future, I need to store it in certain way. And in that particular system, we decided to do that within the vcard of the risk active person, and just the define some x properties for that. The reason I'm showing this here is first of all, somehow to give a little bits a big picture. Of course, every system could do this in a different way or storage into normal database, whatever you have in place for your particular system, one open issue a little bit probably also for the group is"

It might even make sense for such a use case to have said the opportunity to take that with me to another system in a way, but I said, it's a little bit of site. Aspect, but I would like to hear opinions on that probably if somebody has a strong feeling about Next slide, please. Yeah, and just quick note, I think my hope is that chair. Just stay. Oh, sorry. Is that we can also adopt this document and, If the working group decides to adopt it, then It might be an small issue, whether this is in scope for the chat or not. We caught that that If the document is in scope, you need? No. If the vcard purposes is is okay to define in the same spec or not, but I know it's a little thing, and we we can figure it out. So yeah. Okay. Next slide, please. Alright. So here we see some actual screenshots from our implementation. I hope everybody can see it have to look a little bit here on the main screen. So, basically, on the left hand side, you see, the Radcube standard user interface on top for out of office messages. So you can do two things in Roundcube and in many other systems, you can either edit raw, sift rules. Enzys in many cases, also an additional specific, display for things like a vacation notice, which means, like, you, the user doesn't have to do it manually as a complete SIFU and"

So it's basically actually the display on the right side. Is this or less a similar rule, but just in the detailed SIP specific editor. Yeah. So that's 2 different user interfaces run has in place for editing these rules. And as I said, everything, above these advanced settings is basically the standard which you already have in place. And what we added here is basically these, two buttons and, numerical value on on, it's a button here. And so once you enable this thing and this is why I included here this detailed view is, it will more or less automatically generates schema and populate and generates a schemas snippet, which you have been seen on the slides before. Uh-uh and enters this actually in the, in the safe rule, in this vacation action So that is sent out to people, that want to contact me during my vacation notice, and you also see here that for instances, this is something that's done anyway. The start time end time is to in a civil condition on top. But you see also these states and end times are then encoded here in the structured data. So that's, email user agent of the person that is getting back this, this, out of office message can interpret it. There is one more thing here beyond the standard. I also mentioned that the in the into this, into presentation in Prague because there is one additional thing you can actually achieve with this. And this is the second, button, which is basically attaching the out of office even to regular south going Yeah? So, this is like little bit of an experimental feature.

You are writing. We told you, but be aware he's traveling next week, probably rather give him a call So, so this is the idea of this preemtification notice This is actually not, attached here in this, safe vacation rule action, of course, but it is separately attached to outgoing emails by another technical mechanism here in the tool, but, of course, that's too specific. Next slide, please. So how does it look then for as a person on the other side. So that is, basically trying to contact the absentee and then receiving, a message for illustration. So you see, for instance, in the at the top of the mail, that, special highlight, offset message, that says basically, so this is, like, from a preemptive message it's a regular message that was sent, but it includes some start, some out of office information. And, this is especially displayed it's a top. There's a second screenshot here, which is, like, for if I want to proactively write an email to somebody who I know is absent. And in this case, it's not very beautiful, but, it basically is a mail client informs you that the user is currently out of office, and you can just ignore that and send a message nevertheless.

Of course, for illustration. Yeah, next slide, please. If there's no question here, So, yeah, that was basically the way, suspect is mainly written, there is some follow-up questions here. So one question is, some people noting use cases which are not covered yet by that data, which we currently have seen. And the question is a little bit, if this should be a draft to be adopted if that should be, extended as a scope for the draft, or if the draft should better be kept on Focus Lexus is here. So one thing might be, a change of address, something also mentioned in an older RC. That means a person is soon maybe changing, the email address or as a company's merging, something like that, and this is an information you could similarly convey, we as this kind of structure data. A similar thing, which in a way email clients currently cannot understand is no reply. Basically means this is coming from an email address which cannot should not be allowed to send emails to there is a generic issue of updating contact data that's a little bit related probably it was a first point. And some might also be easy ideas that some people might want to include some additional information in the vacation notice for informative purposes. So, like, what if I if I'm to IETF. I might want to tell people I'm at IETF to let them know and to let them probably follow what's going on so that could be an optional addition to that. And there might be other cases as well. Next slide, I think we can probably have if there's no points, no discussion in the meantime, in the end."

So user should not be forced to include, store rectification notices if the email client supports this. If there is a stratification notice, there should still always be a human verification notice, obviously, because you cannot know if, email client of the party receiving the vacation notice supports it. On the other side, there is a question, like, what do you do if you receive afflicting vacation information from a user, like a user might decide to you know, updates a vacation time frame at some point. And so you need to decide, which ones to follow, and not and also one question might be if you want to exclude this kind of includes this brand of structured information if you forward a message to somebody else. So let's see. Let's say Vittorio sends me an email, with simplification information inside as a preemptification notice because a normal vacation notice, I typically might won't might want to forward anyway. But if it's a regular mail, obviously, and I want forwards, this is made to Alex, say, that might expose vacation information of Vuittonio, which, Alexei may, may or not need to know here. Yep. Alright. Next slide. Alright. That's already the final slide. So as Alexi said, one quick would be, if the group sings is is worse to pursue further into adoptions of working group as such. As I already mentioned, also, the question is if this vcard stuff should be included, I would also be happy if somebody is interested to help course rings us I mean, I think it's not incredibly, big draft or complex graph, but still, I think it would make sense to have some more thought about this, and, of course, any other feedback and input is very valuable.

The vcard question who was actually interesting to me. And I've always had sort of a problem with especially, but this particular mechanism getting my head around where in the layers this all fits. But a vacation notice. The vacation itself seems like it should be a calendar object of some sort because it's got a start date and an end date, and then it's got embedded other stuff And the other stuff like the, replacement person might be a vcard or a j card in there. And I could imagine implementing this such that if I put a vacation notice and check it as such in my calendar that the email system would notice that and start generating the SML to do this stuff. So I think it makes sense to me To have these objects be Jay Cal objects and j card objects. But I'm not sure how that fits together with how the mechanism gets implemented. May I may maybe, you can stay to make sure that if I'm allowed to respond on us. I'm I'm not sure one thing is probably important to distinguished. So what is proposed here to put in the v card is not the vacation information of the absentee itself. So if if if you are using that system and then you say I'm absent. I'm at IETF, and I want to have that included in my outgoing out of office sent to other people. Right. This will not go to the v cart.

Because your email client might want to remember I'm on vacation so that if you try to write me an email, Right. So, I mean, take that example. So you're you go on vacation, you're email client sends me a Hans. You're on vacation. I would think Yeah. That it would be handy to me for that to be a calendar object. Because I might want to enter that into my calendar that says on 0 on vacation. From here to here. Yep. That that that's the kind of data that I want. the That's absolutely correct. I just wanted to ensure that in first said Right. there's Because the configuration information for the Sieve, and then there's the what structure you're sending me. Absolutely. Yeah. And And the replacement people Yeah. Might be j cards or v cards because I may wanna enter them into my address book and Yeah. I totally get your point on that. And I also see your points that it's sort of weird in that case to store calendar data is the address book, obviously. Yeah. The re I just wanna explain the reason why this is currently done or why it's suggested here. It's basically done because we are also leveraging, the address book for trust mechanism. So we say only, you know, considers this if this is already a person in the address book. And also the question is a little bit if by default, let let's say you this is widely implemented and you receive, like, 20 of those, do you want to have all of them automatically stacked in your clients like, random person, X is absent.

Hi, Jim Fenton. Yes, adopt. You asked the question about are there clients that that, Have finer granularity than date. Microsoft Outlook allows you to specify a start and an ending date and time. So maybe that that that answers that question. The other thing that they allow is to specify whether the message whether the, vacation message goes to only the same domain or or elsewhere and that kind of brings up the idea if you've got something that's machine readable you might actually want to have some kind of an indication as to the sensitivity of the information that vacation message that if somebody forwards it outside the domain, It might get stripped off or or something like that.

And in general, around the all these structural data because in the moment in which you turn data, which is not machine readable into something which is easily machine readable and processable and forgettable and Then the the practical privacy risk becomes much higher. So I I I first started saying, okay, you know, maybe I can provide input to for a privacy considerations section in this draft. But then I thought, do do we need something horizontal throughout all of SML? Would we rather have a general reasoning on how we should in or we'll have it. We do it by draft draft.

Everybody of us knows that a little bit I think, this, this message is from a service I I tried to, hide it a little bit, but you see still in support from our friends of mail, it's basically a confirmation code. You have, you have to enter a to, second factor, you have to end up logging into a a mailing list software, and you receive set by email. Many of those, of you know also that similar thing, getting by SMS. And, obviously, the simple thing you need to do here is to copy paste it. Right? But it's still a very manual process in a way, and this is a super tiny, helps that basically could allow an email client to understand. This is the things that needs to be copied and probably offer you a button or something like So you might have noticed in some of the SMS messages which you get you have this kind of option to directly copy the codes of percent. If somebody knows more about that, that would be very interesting. I try to do a bit of research on it seems that this is currently just, guessing and heuristics so that basically SMS email, SMS, apps, to, try identify codes colon, colon, so space.

And you are typically offered like Facebook, instant messaging tools, as a social networks and so on. And there was also good old emails sometimes. Sir. And, I, ask you, try it out. It's it's very funny how different services to it. So some will in the past, and there are still some existing that will give you a form, which, of course, is a little bit spam problem because the email is sent on behalf of the site, typically. Most typically nowadays, we'll just have a mail to URI scheme attached to it it will open your email client. And the left hand side is what happens if you, for instance, do that on Spotify, and launch k9 email on Android. And as you can see, it will basically paste the URL, into the body.

And it basically is was introduced by Twitter for pasting URLs into Twitter. And, This is basically how they do renders and this kind of information. And, So this use case with structured data could be very easily, also used with an email because many of the services like Spotify just don't only have security cards, but also they already have chemA annotations within certain pages, like songs, you can also look set up in your browser. And, what you can do here is you can just pull that out of the page and embed it within the email. And, the nice thing in the case of email is also, to be clear, so tracking aspect involved in that regarding the image. Yeah. So if you, for instance, send it, in an instant messaging tool to somebody else the SMS and tool might download that on the recipient side. And so the service knows, okay, is this and these people have received that kind of shared, item. And within email, when you share it here inside kind of structured information way, you could already in, includes the image something mail was in the sent mail from the receiver side, and probably wouldn't have something problematic on the recipient side. And the other nice thing of course is due to using the information here again, difference and in an instant messaging tool where you just have a nice hard display, but it's a messaging tool. There's no idea. This is cooking recipe. Is this a song? Is this something else?

So when your sense is kind of structured information in the message by share by email. What do you want people to do for those clients that don't have, the possibility to show structured data yet. And so So what we, did here in that case is that we automatically generate an HTML version of that, thing, yeah, which is just a fallback for those clients, which cannot do the rendering by their, by their own. So they just, they just get a standard rendering. This case, of an album or song, Alright. And as a similar case, I I don't even need to talk too much about it is location sharing. So in many messaging tools, you can share your location or some location with people, and you receive a similar kind of card rendering about that. And, obviously, also, if you try some map software and try to send location by email is the same case actually as before with the media. It's, just a u l. And so, again, basically, it's very similar to the other use case one interesting I think future question, which is currently out of scope of the charter would, of course, also be how to deal with effect such information updates over time. So what you want, in such cases also probably, to have means that allows the initial sender of the email to update that in information either either in another message, which could of course, result in a lot of messages or if you would, have some other means for that, but Yeah. I think that's probably too much of discussion for the moment. Next slide, please. That's like use case.

And on the other hand, there is some bigger vendors like, Office 365, Outlook com or Gmail that allow you to basically react on a message you receive by a thumbs up a heart or something like that. But at the moment, this is not interoperable, so it works very well within their ecosystem so if you send within Office 365, that all works very well. If there is one party involved using another provider or just a normal email client, basically is a kind of message you received from Gmail is the one you see here at the bottom. So it's mainly a textual representation of that. Yeah. So, and, yeah, so that might be this might obviously something you could do in, in this with structured data also, in order to make this more interoperable. And, that's also maybe interesting if you think about things like, Activity pop or activity streams, which actually, you know, this is kind of favors networking software. So, actually, you already even have re presentations for these kind of, interactions defined in a structured manner so that could even be reused or make in operable with these kind of services. Next slide, please. Yeah, one more generic case is actually newsletters So, newsletters, I think, are still a big deal in the email, used by many marketers and people that, you know, commercially send around emails, if you like it or not, but I think it's one of, still one of the most powerful use cases that drives the adoption of email to a certain extent, also especially from a sender side and where a lot of effort put into.

And, obviously, that would not be applied to this recipe use case, but could think about similar things if you have a music newsletter and so on and so on and so on. Next slide, please. Okay. I think this is already the final use case. This is actually part of some larger hallway discussion we had in, Prague, some people. And so the idea is a little bit, you know, one of the initial arguments in the SMS and email is sort of your API a little bit in which you interface all with services, you subscribed. You come to Australia, you subscribe with a e scooter vendor or something like that. You receive an email, hey, this is is good of and or X, welcome to Australia this is your user ID. This is your link to reset your password and on. And, if you're not traveling, but at home, like your electricity provider also on, you might even receive emails continuously with your invoice, something like that, And what many people do is probably is I have something like a folder where they put all of sale. Electricity provider emails into, but this is some work to do somehow, and probably it would be nice if your email client would understand this is my, what a contract or something like that, and similar to context, calendars, tasks, could provide a view of that and, maybe even know what case this contract is terminating, or this is maybe the,"

So it's probably one one idea. And on the other hand, you could also try under try think about conveying information about acceptable URLs to be sent by a provider. So you could for instance, teach your email client initially you know, this is your contract with your electricity provider and these are the 3 or 4 URLs, which the electricity providers allowed to send And afterwards, your email client could actually pooved email addresses from that, sender could block it and say, okay. This is not a just. Dotdotdot Okay. So you see this is a little bit of a more advanced use case to think about but, yeah, it's probably also worth mentioning is initially. Okay. Next steps.

I think Ben Books, who is I think not here this time, also wanted you to help, but, yeah, any input is anywhere that comes sync k.

Very, very helpful. I think for the first point since since this came at second time now with the trust and security things. I think this is even in the charter working groups that we have this explicit draft for that to address it. So this is why this is kept out of this presentation here, a little bit on purpose, but on the other hand, course, it's even good that it triggers such kind of, questions and observations. Because it's just the idea that this might help us actually better understand the designs trust and security document is yet. Right? And in a similar way, I agree with you about the modeling thing, even though at this point of time, we are, I think, not yet in that stage, but also deriving such kind of recommendations and observations as I think a very, good thing at some which we at some point should think about, how this could be structured.

Just just briefly. Think the pattern that I've seen where you do trust and security in separate document Is that it doesn't it doesn't really get taken seriously and it's treated as sort of an adjunct. And I think this is actually core to what we want here. You're not gonna see a male user agent be willing to adopt this. Without getting egg on their face if you know, We just say, oh, the clip board and then it turns out there's some sort of, like, I don't know, clipboard overflow or clip forward spam thing that can happen, right, or forward email, and all of a sudden, your exfiltrating your address book. So I really think that the each scenario In the use case, should contain or should be close to a description of how it could be potentially abused. We all know you know, keeping that close to the use cases and thinking about, like, describing how we think about it will help us build I think the the appropriate instincts for, you know, as new use cases come up. So, that's why I would lean towards keeping that together. Anyway, I'm I'm I'm glad we're talking about this. I'm not saying it's don't, you know, don't do it. I just think we should keep the trust and security privacy and security questions, pretty close. I mean, very short comment. It's it's interesting a very valuable comment, because there was a lot of discussion on that very initially before the working group was founded. It's this obviously, it's one of the major things for this whole working group which is why it was singled out to be a dedicated, draft in a way. Yes. So it's interesting what can also see it's the other way around, of course. You will find, certainly, already also in the court documents that should not be adopted before also the trust or, sorry, published or, released before also this trust document is ready.

There were some smaller, things in the document but also some, some more bigger things, which I will mention in the presentation. There is also, 1st demo implementation of this which we partly have seen already in the previous presentations, which you can also download in which we will see a little bit of it, also in this presentation. Next slide, please. Yeah, so the the things that probably is most foundational besides securing trust is, on how to put the structure data within the emails. There was a lot of discussion about that, about the different options. Before the product meeting and during the product meeting, it's also mentioned in the documents, the actual trade offs are quite clear. So there is actually existing work right now, which is probably technically not so clean. Basically means that the structured data is sort of put into the GML body part of the email in the script tech, various, of course, if you would designs us from scratch, in a cleaner way, you would, for instance, use you know, dedicated multi part related multi part alternative, structures here. So that discussion in a way we we did to a certain extent already in Prague, said at some points is is is is a fundamental thing to be decided in a way.

So one of the things we didn't discuss in that detail or only very shortly touched, and it probably is interesting to discuss here right now is basically, These cases, so maybe just going one step back. Think one of the, important distinctions is draft makes is this case about what's what is meant as full representation and partial representation, just to repeat that shortly. The idea is mainly that, there is a difference if structure data in an email is just partially represents the content of the human readable part of the email."

So as a newsletter, I've shown you before, this New York Times cooking newsletter is a good example. The effect that there is a single recipe attached as a a data element doesn't mean this is fully representative of the user experience, right, on the other hand, you might have the case, let's say, of a flight reservation where an airline sends your book fly to you and basically the information, which the human readable part is exactly the information in the structure part. It's when is your flight going, what is flight number, lada, lada, lada, So in that case, obviously, the email client could either proceed with some automated ways instructed the email client like that because, you know, you said, like, if service fight was innovation act systems that are part of this, or the email client could decide to, yeah, just represents this in a different way based on the structured data. And now going to that partial case, so there might be coexistence of structured data, email, and emails, and the HTML email part. So there might be scenarios who still consume, HTML emails. But you also have structured data, which somehow annotates these And the question is now how do these particular cases interrelay? What what kind of implications come from there. And one kind of obvious case is, let's say, again, for that recipe case, you have an image of the recipe. So there is, like, select bowl or something like that. You have some image in the normal MIME structure, for the HTML email, but then you also have an image property within the structured data. You might want to avoid duplicating this kind of information. The proposal here is actually quite straightforward. You already know that from, HTML even as such. This is viewing the CID your ice scheme for internally referencing content elements from the MIME Tree."

I think there is just two things that might need to be considered. So I'm, not sure if there might be corner cases based on that. So can this be abused in some way or can this lead to some difficulties in certain, situations. So if somebody has an opinion on that, that would be interesting. Second thing is I think this would probably in the document at least need some guidance for the case that structured data is removed from the email context. So if the email client would, for instance, allow you to export, structured data separately from the email as far as I understand, so CID, your ice scheme is only defined within the MIME context, So the email client at least, would need to covers that ideally in order not to break 6. K. Jake? Yeah, Jim Fin. The main case that I can think of where the human readable content is is maybe subset of the machine readable content is when you've got, like, tracking links and things like that. You know, little pixels and and also, the those those sorts of things. I think Need to consider what the potential privacy implications of of that are here and there needs to be, the ability for some for the recipient of the mail, to either accept or not accept, that sort of thing that they're that invisible tracking. Mhmm. I I think it's a valid Yeah. thing, but I think it's unrelated to the issue on the slide. In the sense that, well, CID will never be it's always it's CID is only used inside multi parts related to a straw, the body parts. So it's Can have a trick trigger that tracking bug, basically.

So, slide is the now is a question, On the left hand side, again, you have said recipe newsletter from the New York Times. And, now you have, as I said, structured data about certain recipes mentioned in the next No? Without any additional means, your email client will not know a actually to which part of the human readable message a certain piece of structured data basically belongs. Obviously, you could do some Euristic text matching in a way, but, first of all, it's it's not strictly necessary if there are other way other ways to do so, and it might obviously be not as, as good. So the question is, would it make sense to allow offices of these kind of, emails or newsletters to denote, actually, is that a certain piece of, information within the newsletter refers to a certain piece of structured data. So let's see, your email client can probably leverage set by whatever adding a certain pop up or whatever kind of information.

Right. Like, you know, like, when you reference, XML schema, you know, for the schema elements. You don't expect them to be necessarily published on the web, but it might accidentally be resolved. Again, there is security consideration. Yeah. Pete. I'm unconvinced that this is necessary or desirable. I think over the long term, if SNL gets implemented by clients, what you're gonna do is you're gonna drag the recipe into your message. It might appear as a piece of text with a link that says sheet panchopsaladrecipe and which you can change, and it will have a pointer with a CID to the structured data that exists in the message.

And, obviously, you can meet one of the other by introducing a way to, you know, do one direction. And, obviously, the client can do the math to to resolve. I sort of understood you sort of propose like that. But in this particular case, at least the CID would probably be enough because he would, he would want to reference. He wants to, want to say, this recipe references this thing in the human readable part. Right? So you would need something beyond the me a CID, which only can refer to media, right, like, to a to a video. Well, I I guess I don't think this case will will come up. People will either put it in purposely, like the previous slide and therefore, the client will already know to highlight that piece of tech Mhmm. With the CID or they're gonna not want it referenced.

And this kind of thing is is obviously more difficult to do in the HTML as such. So this is the idea why you would have opportunity to do an interaction with an, you know, human readable message, but where you know this part of the human readable message is carrying some structured, meaning and this kind of meeting you want to act upon. And very shortly what this particular slide is about is even a second level distinction, you know, very shortly. And this is this distinction is, like, as will repeat also put out. You can put the recipe in completely, like it's on the right hand side in the human readable part, and then, of course, this visualization, like on the left hand side, would be sort of duplicate. Right? So it looks a little weird when you see the same kind of pop up showing you the same thing you already see in the unreadable part. But, of course, the email client does not know because the email client might only underspend machine readable part, but the email client might not understand how the editor designs human readable part. And so the idea here is to have even a second parameter which could, which could help distinguish for the email client to understand if if the entity which exists as structured data is on the left hand side just mentioned by name, for instance, or if it is really like 1st order representation, and could accordingly adapt in terms of the user interaction, that could be offered.

How does structured data, relate to other messages you have in your mailbox or you exchange with other people, And one obvious case is if you forward a mail manually. So we are not talking necessarily about automatic forwarding to another account of yours or something like that or like aliases but about you receive an email from somebody, I might say, example before we see auto office, I get an email by Vittorio, which is out of office.

Like, I was recently sending forwarded a message over a mailing list would have let me unsubscribe the person who forwarded it from another mailing list. Mhmm. Mhmm. Right? So there is a generic issue with email about what what know, if there's pieces that we think should not be forwarded how to annotate them so that at least compliant clients can do that. And I don't know that this should be solved specific to structured email. I think if we're gonna try to solve that, we should be trying to solve that generally for for email for clients that are We're never gonna fix legacy clients. But if there was a way to annotate that certain links, they should not be forwarded when you're in the process of forwarding, That would be a great thing to have. I just, I just, you know, I just don't know. Like, that's relevant for You know, arbitrary elements of the DOM, even in in a text HTML part. Though Anyway, I just wanted to flag that I don't No. I'm not sure this is a this is some This may not be something that needs to be solved with SML, particularly. This may be something for mail made. I don't know. But but very good point. Agree and I good example, actually. Yep. Yeah. I I I agree with, DKG and I mean, nowadays, many implementations are if I forward it and it's in lined stuff. That is if it's CID stuff, I do include it. If it's attachment stuff, I don't include it. At least I've seen that from a few clients, And I think it's gonna have to be a case by case thing if we expect implementations to do something different than that, some very general sense of what's good to forward and what's not."

Fair enough. And I assume you'll you'll you'll type in your own Okay. Thank you. Okay. Next slide? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not I don't see the queue, so you'll need to Okay. So, I didn't see Okay. Okay. So this is about, replying to structured email. So, Again, you might, want to you know, your email client might allow you to reply to a structured email Normally, for this particular case, there is a flag in, the IMF RRCs historically, I think since the beginning, called answered, like a system flag. And, the question is a little bit, does it not allow a client to understand if in some case there was a structured email sent in response to that. Which you also would not want to do tries. Yeah. So in in theory, a user could could respond, of, obviously, also in real world, the user can respond infinitely, that shouldn't amount of times. However, the email client will initially, put a hint there since this email has at least once been replied. Based on that flag, typically. Structured email, it might be a little bit different that you might not want even to do an infinite number responses in some cases. For instance, if you want to confirm a flight or something like that based on that, and so for that case, I might you might want to have a a similar flag or a parallel flag, which distinguishes, like, so human readable answers or, you know, a regular answer versus a structured data answer. That's basically what it's about. I hope it's clear. Yeah. I'll just, give an example of something else"

    "startTime": "01:16:01",
    "text": "which is somewhat similar that we already do with MDN requests. Like, you know, have you seen, acknowledge that you've seen this, received this message? We have similarly defined dollar mgnsend. Flag, which basically, if there are multiple clients viewing the message, only one of them will generate a response. And then they will send a flag saying that it was actioned. Maybe a bit of a bike shed, a little thing, answered structured, might not be the right word, maybe it's actioned, actioned. Or something, but, I'm We can. sure we can. Figure it out. One side question on this. Was a little bit confused when I looked it up by myself also about the MDN sense that this was think the dollar says it's a user flag, basically. Right? So historically, it's It's a convention. Yes. But I think it was probably also in MDN already by designs one didn't want to extend the system flags because that would too big of a deal, I guess. Right? Yes. Everything starting with the flash as a system flag, you cannot really extend them without updating the server. But, So, and use of dollar is a convention. Why we decided to have a dollar, you know, because some people also registered flex without a dollar, and they are kind of still valid. Yeah, I think it's those kind of signifies that there might be some standard behind it or it's defined somewhere. Okay. Seems okay. Fine. But other than that, semantically, there is no dollars not magical in in this space. Like, well, so it's no more question. Quick. Chair, interrupt, 5 We have, you know, I gave you half an hour. We have one minute left. Do people want to continue with this, or shall we switch to trust? How how much Shall we continue? House."

How about, like, 5 minutes? And then we'll I'll ask again. Okay. So maybe let's do the next 2 or 3, in a row and have questions after that, if there are any, right? Okay. Okay. So one a little bit specific cases, error replies. And this is basically, It's a issue. So I might re receive a structured email. Right? And typically I might not want an automatic response. Like, if that's email was broken for somehow. Let's say my airline sends me a a flight reservation. I don't want my client to tell the airline you have broken, data or something like that inside. Right? And that is also okay for both parties probably. However, if I'm to confirm that kind of message. Like, let's say, again, this is a flight reservation, and I might have structured email answer, like, I confirms a check-in or something like that. If my email client does something wrong on that structured email or if probably the flight is already concerned or canceled or something said, I might want to have actually an kind of error reply to that. Because otherwise, I safely assume, you know, that has been processed and everything fine. So this is basically the use case here. So it's not yet good proposal, probably MDNDSN style mechanisms might be the thing. Yeah. Probably is something to discuss on the list or maybe later on, but maybe next slide first. Yeah. Another thing is updates. So if I have human readable messages, there's something wrong or no more recent, I can just send another email, like, can, our meeting has changed, has moved to lessen the date the reader can understand it. Everything is fine. I have structured data, of course, I need to tell"

    "text": "I need to help the email client to be able to understand this is basically an update of the previous email, right? There is a historic header called Superseeds, which sort of has this kind of semantics. So there was some proposal already from prior discussions, I think, in sets this could be used. So this is actually in the room, for this, there's always a little bit of a probably problem of using some historic header, not so many people might be con using so far and so on. Yeah. I think Pete might be looking slightly confused, but supersedes would define for mixer. Yeah. I know. But, I mean, this comes up. So it has the same semantic as supersedes, I think. In in general, this also has may might even have some site issues, like what happens if the data, which is now updated has already been processed in some way, so there's a whole lot of stuff that comes out of this So I guess this is an issue we will anyway discuss in more detail at later times, it won't solve by today, for sure. Next slide, please. Okay. And I think that we're already across email things. Very shortly also this because I think also this is nothing we will solve by now. There is things like calendaring where we also have a situation like, in an in an distributed client server setting. Like, we have multiple clients on the same mailbox, there might be multiple portions of software acting on my behalf. Like for instance, I might have a calendar configured to process on the server already from a webmail. But I might also have my, desktop client, my mobile client want to act upon that calendar, and this is sort of something I need to handle manually right now. So there's actually no way as far as I know how my different calendar clients know of each as I, if I even have multiple ones. I think this is basically a problem that is left to practice, which means that Most people would just have a single cat out now, but,"

    "text": "the problem, of course, is a little bit more complicated in here. Because I want, once I start having structured data and emails, I might have cases where I want to have something, I guess, if extension on the server side doing some things, some stuff is structured data. And of course, in that case, clients should be aware that this has been processed already. So this is it's a core basically of of what is happening here. So, the question is first of all a little bit again. Do we need some sort of flags? Probably is a help certain clients to be informed. Again, since this was already processed or something like that, so this is one category here. So it might be even a longer term thing here, which is, I think, out of scope a little bit of the charter, but I wanted to mention it. And there was a which is more about what we not even need similar to the message store API, server side API on mail service support structure data for the structured data. So that all clients somehow have a common view on the the data and don't need to do a local processing in some way. But, yeah, again, this is probably, yep, then you. Thanks for this. So I'm just trying to make sure that I understand the scope here. I generally understood structured email to be about. We define the contents of a message and how those your agents would interact with it. And I'm now hearing this scope creep out into questions of say, I'm at representation or JMAT representation, server side flags, things like that. So so As you may or may not know, I am an advocate trying to get and then encrypted email fixed. Then I'm concerned about how much information leaks to the mail servers. So I'm a little bit confused about when we say defining appropriate flags, really talking about leaking some part of the Melius Agent State To some potentially adversarial server. Right? But no. I mean, the question here is, like, for instance, if rules at some I mean, you typically process them on yours, on your email server or your provider's email server. Right? Right."

    "text": "And so the question is, and this is an open question. Must be provided to the mail server because they're gonna take action when your mail user agent is not online. Exactly. And so this might also be for some cases or struck data, you might want to you know, have set functionality. I mean, Somebody? Okay. So, you know, this is this is actually not, I mean, actually what to do with structure data in that sense is out of scope of the, of the charter, right, But, it's it's it's might not be forbidden that somebody wants to you know, like, if I have a SIF rule, like, if there is a message coming from somebody at Fastmail, I can have that, right, but I might also you know, you know, you know, the future. If if, if my, you know, my email provider or clients can understand this, I might also want to create rules for that. Right? I mean, we don't have set extension for SIP right now, but I might want to do and even if you even if you just remove And so server part on that, right, you might still have multiple clients that might want to understand that another client already that one something or so. So I I mean, just to reinforce this, I think constructing this as, well, you might have a sieve thing that's going to on these. I think that's the right construction. Right. And that's I, as a user, am going to configure my SIV to work at the server level or at not. I think trying to embed lots of implementation tail into the objects themselves as the mistake. So don't think about this as, oh, we've gotta come up with this metadata, Think about this as SML's job is to define the objects, define what the objects mean, all that. And if we need civ rules, that's a separate document in this separate topic. Right. Because what"

So I I I'm These issues seem orthogonal. And it seemed like things we should define elsewhere, not as part of the SML itself. We can talk about this for offline. Yeah. And I just posted, comment. Yeah, I I think, I agree. Sieve extension is currently not scope, but if we just decide just adhere that it will be helpful. We can figure out where to do it. So so I think it's not technically necessarily out of scope. It's just like, I'll double check the exact wording. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I do. Yep. Okay. Okay. I can I think we can skip some next one, which is Yeah? I think we can have that the next time. It's also not something urgent for the draft. So as for, next steps, Okay. Question is generally, I think there might be still also open issues in the court draft as such So things like we identified here, but, other things that are not yet identified and might need to be addressed. So that's a call to everybody, to even to also consider, like, it's a unknowns here that need to be thought about, beyond obvious things also, like, the trust and security thing we will come to. Yeah, we already talked very shortly at the beginning about general idea of putting, structured data within the mind body parts, And, yeah, we also talked about, identifiers things"
