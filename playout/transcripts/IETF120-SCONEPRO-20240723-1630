That was a good discussion on a number of points It was clear that there were some open questions at the end of that meeting and there has been quite a lot of work since then on addressing those questions You'll observe that there is quite a number of drafts related to this work there is no expectation that you've read all of those documents, although it would help if you haven't understood sort of topics in there that this was, I think, listening materials at some point reading them.

Do we? actually know how to solve that problem in a very general? sense? And do we have people here? that are interested in doing that work? Do you think we can be successful at the IETF? in achieving that goal? And that's it. These are essentially the questions we'll be asking at the end of the session.

I will do a very brief overview of the problem statement and kind of why we're here and what we're trying to solve. So in case you haven't seen this before, this is just a little short overview so the it's a common practice in many networks today that you do kind of what we do call ABR video shaping. So this is a way of managing traffic by throttling or shaping certain traffic flows that tend to be adaptive so that you reduce the volume that these flows consume This is done to manage load. There's also common practice to kind of use this mechanism to differentiate between subscription tiers and so on. These shapers are deployed typically as like token bucket filters of some sorts that either delays packets as in shaping or drops packets like a policer Oftentimes you configure this player to be, sorry, this shaper to be trying to force a video player to adapt its quality target to some specific bitrate like 2 megabits per second. Next slide, please So why is this done? Well, because a common class of traffic is what we call adaptive bitrate video So this is a scheme of delivering streaming video to clients where the client is continuously estimating the capacity of the network, selecting an appropriate video quality that kind of ensures a smooth playback. So you continuously measure your own buffer, you measure your network capacity, and you decide which video quality I'm going to select for my next video segment. So this works fine. Real-time video has"

    "text": "similar properties as well often, like trial and error to kind of optimize or try to find the optimal bitrate Next slide, please. So with shaping the network then kind of forces the tries to force a client into a specific range of quality by detecting the flow shaping that flow to a certain bitrate, sort of so that the player, so that the player bitrate This can be done under congestion to kind of manage the load or it can be, you know, as part of a subscription plan, etc cetera. So in this particular case, the desired outcome could be that you want the ABR to select a 2 megabit percent, second video track. Next slide So this works, but there are problems with this, like the ABR schemes they don't converge very quickly, so this can lead to poor user experience. They might be trialing for some higher quality the shaper kicks in, and then it takes time for it conversion to find a good, proper quality Also, this kind of shape, and policers interact interestingly with congestion control who are typically more suited to kind of classic queuing mechanisms So you can have, you know, shapers that momentarily let through large bursts of traffic and then they kind of shrink the available bandwidth for some time and it can be very difficult for a congestion controller to kind of add and find a suitable rate So the problem with all this is that the limit imposed by these shapers and policers is artificial So while it can kind of support this instance, high bandwidth, sometimes it then needs to compensate for that. So you get problems and it's hard to converge and get good quality of your video pretty much. So next slide, please. So what we propose needs to compensate for that. So you get problems and it's hard to converge and get good quality of your video pretty much. So next slide, please. So what we're proposing here is to instead explicitly inform the video application about what bitrate cap is applied in this network So with an explicit information sent as a"

So you can select a quality track based on this explicit information So we kind of move from being congestion limited to be to determine what the optimal rate is, so you can select a quality track based on this explicit information. So we kind of move from being congestion limited to being application limited. Then you can may or may not decide to disable shaping completely in your network. That depends on the deployment. But this is kind of what we're trying to solve. Make this thing transparent and explicit So you get better performance in this case And yeah, this is the short recap of this problem statement Okay, any questions here? clarification? We saw last time we met some performance numbers of what this much look like, but that was from a trial Matt, you want to come up and give us the next one? Thanks Marcus Hello, everyone.

This discussion has been split across numerous places, both directly on the sad scene mailing list, which is the original name for this work but also on GitHub where we across numerous places, both directly on the sad CDN mailing list, which is the original name for this work, but also on GitHub, where we've been working on the charter, and there's been made issues and discussions on those issues.

And then of course, we've been working a lot on a proposed charter so and that charter has changed significantly It's changed probably most significantly since the last BOPF, but even more recent in the last few weeks there's been a lot of honing in on certain ideas, removing certain things, and a lot of clarifications So we're not going over that this presentation is not going over the charter or the PRs or anything like that. We're just talking about a higher level. And also, we want to identify any open questions that we've missed as part of this. So, and that will be we'll be able to discuss those later Next slide Okay, so one of the biggest questions is this one about scope, and this is one where we've been really honing in on certain things So the focus now on the charter is on network to host signaling and also on all networks, not just mobile So it would apply to all networks where this could be relevant because we believe that it is relevant to all networks And there's also a list of out of scope items in the charter explicitly enumerated and we will be seeing that later as we go over the charter And so that was something that was clearly needed after the last boff is that, you know, having a specific list of things that you know this is not about Next slide Okay, so extensibility There were many discussions and questions about like, we have this goal, but what could this also be used for?

So this is basically exposing that information and only that information, not other things and anything else that would could be extended like is not in the current charter Next slide Privacy. So this is obviously an extremely important topic. Whenever you're exchanging information and that information is emerging from the network and ending up at an end point there's obviously a very natural concern about what are the privacy implications of this work. And so right now, the idea with Scone Pro, as outlined in the Charter, is that it is often and it's opt-in from a client so this is a client a client initiates this, and the information that's flowing is from the network to that client. So the only information that's really coming in the other direction is the information that, hey, this is ABR video But what's the key thing to note about this is that this information is already there today. It has to be there in some form because operators need to know what flows through their networks are video because it's just an absolute need of their operation because of how important managing video load is on their networks And so today, you know, those are identified with numerous mechanisms, the most common is, you know, being"

And so anytime you're exchanging information from the network, the natural question arises is how can I trust this information? So if that's a very natural question, but so one thing to think about this is can you actually do it? So what security property? can you achieve? And so if you look back, at the proof of concept we did at the last box some of that is addressed in that proof of concept of the broad strokes of what we think are possible in this space But another thing to that we've been thinking, about more is what kinds of things could be problematic here in terms of like what do you really need to trust and the thing that is most important is that Scroen Pro itself is optional in advisory. This isn't something we think are required thing for a video flow And so there's any given client does not have to use it And so it can choose to ignore it and choose to trust it as it sees fit and so that's so that's true whenever the client wants to initiate this and choose to use it or not Next slide And then of course we have the question of incentives. So why"

So the behind the connection And so that's the people that use video on the internet And the reason that they would be benefit from this is because shaping and policing of video traffic fundamentally leads to poor outcomes for that video and we've been able to show and we really believe that you can improve the quality of experience of that video by not having the network shape and or police that traffic and instead having this explicit cooperation The other thing that is important for why a standard here is important rather than just, you know, unilaterally trying to have these sorts of agreements between certain content providers and certain internet providers is that by having a standard that used continuously and is a property of networks any smaller video provider or a one that is not a current dominant place has an equal opportunity to provide this to their users and that fundamentally means that you know, a user can switch between video heavy products that they want to consume and not have a worse experience on other simply because they're a smaller video provider does not have the resources to have these relationships where they strike agreements about you know, video policy on the internet By having a standard, you know, they just need to opt into that standard and then they get the same benefits For carriers, the main incentive here is that these traffic shaping systems are expensive in many ways They're computationally intensive.

So we think that this is one of those cases where there are actually relatively aligned incentives between all of the parties, assuming we restrict, we have some restrictions around, you know, how, what kind of information is exchanged Next slide So this is always a tricky topic net neutrality partially because it's not really a well-defined single thing, but it's been raised and naturally it should be raised And we have a draft about this, but fundamentally, we do not think that Scone Pro is really changing anything with regards to net neutrality so we are responding Scone Pro is a response to existing practices that are varied throughout different markets throughout the world and it's basically offering an alternative to some of those practices, but does not really change the core of what those practices are doing And that is something that's, you know, the subject of regulations and individual markets and a standard protocol in this space that is changing this limited bit of information is not really changing the net neutrality story. Next slide. All right, that's it That's it. Okay. And I think right now are we just doing clarifying questions on these topics? rather than going into the questions themselves? I mean, we've got lots of time to, you know, this is our conclusions that are led to the current version of the charter We'll have lots of time to discuss the Charter and implications of that going forward, but certainly want to take clarifying questions on this right now Have a few.

Or is that? just, or is that not the intent? So, yes, it is in the charter enforcement mechanism I don't think we've really thought about that because it's somewhat unknowable whether it's true like so in general with this with this, the trust model here, we expect in reality there's a degree of like trust but verify so it's advisory information, right? So if like a client is lying about what it is or or for example a network is lying about its limits, like, yeah, all of that is possible because there's no way to prevent it but there are humans that run these things and the humans have their own ways of digging into what's really going on, and then the humans talk to each other and, you know, figure it out. That's kind of our expectation and that's what happens today with these kinds of the system. Does I answer your question? Yeah, I think so at the risk of not clarifying it sounds like there isn't actually a privacy experience here if there's nothing to prevent a client from you know uh using say, ECH and saying, I'm ABR, but he's not actually ABR right? Thank you Just a second, Martin, I missed your point on that So today on the network there's, I mean so you're saying there's nothing, there's no technical mechanism to prevent a client from ignoring this data that we're going to provide them. No, no, the opposite So Matt's comment was that there was a potential privacy exposure in that the client communicates it as ABR is ABR. Now granted, they're, they're,"

Obviously, there's all these things like ECH coming down the pike, which might change that scheme, but if there's no enforcement mechanism then the client is not in fact communicating it as ABR video necessarily. It could be some other application entirely And thus, there's no privacy exposure. Got it Now just remember clarifications questions are in place. Liza and Mozilla So, quick statements of the presentations, Matt and also marked were great. Thank you. So they're highly polished and easy to follow Good job. The question is, it's the inverse of Martin. So you said earlier, that there wouldn't be privacy concern because the clients have signals you know i'm doing a vr for this but, you know, not no other information flows up like, you know, what video stream? this is or so on. I'm actually wondering, sort of does any subscriber information gets exposed? So would the operator be able to be able to decline responding to a request? and could, therefore, the operator decide to only, you know, offer this feature to customers who pay extra? So the intention right now is that this would not be explicitly have subscriber information in it whether the information exchange implicitly communicates subscriber information is like this same thing happens today. Now, and to answer to is like the same thing happens today. Now, to answer your question about could an operator just choose to know for certain flows? Yes, just like today they can choose to not shape certain flows if they're like, I'm just going to not do Scone Pro for this flow versus this flow They've similarly not shaped this flow versus this flow Not shaping makes it better for the user"

That's what I'm worried like if the system sort of didn't have the ability for an operator to distinguish users into bucket I think that's sort of the high level point Q Mycel MPI and I have two questions The first is you've talked mostly about ABR, is that the only thing that's been considered or are other network properties? properties? is the charter just about ABR or? are other network properties also considered has any work been done on anything other than ABR? My, yeah, I'll let you answer that first. The Charter exclusively target ABR video over Quick, where ABR is things like video playback but also potentially say like RTC, video play, video Quick, things like that, but has other work been done, like maybe thought work, there's nothing explicitly of matured charter or in any document about other potential? properties? Okay, I think that's a limitation that shouldn't be there but uh myself second question is, does, is request for information explicitly linked to a traffic flow? or does the client say hey, what video bitrate can I? do and then independent and then there's no link between asking about the network properties and saying, and the actual flow so if would there be a possibility for the network operator to decide the shaper for a specific flow or add a different shaper onto a flow because the client asked about the network?"

So to answer your question, the expectation right now is that it would be associated with a flow So a given quick connection through so you're asking for information about this quick connection that carries ABR video Give me the properties for that, please So it would be possible to differentiate, like, you can for information about this quick connection that carries ABR video. Give me the properties for that, please. So it would be possible to differentiate, like, you could add a different flow rate onto Netflix or Disney Plus. That would be theoretically possible for an operator to do, yes. A question for people to think about that, is that something we want to allow? I'm not expecting an answer right now Hi, Watson-Lennan-Lad Acomai My question, is this, can we see? this basically as a mechanism to advertise to any flow what the bandwidth constraints are? on scales beyond the lifetime of congestion? control? Or is that too general? So we are going to talk about that a little bit when we go over the charter And one of the out-of-scope items is explicitly that this is not a replacement to congestion control. Specifically, this is more application layer information So in this case, that application is explicitly ABR video. So while an operator may choose to send this signal, based on some notion it has of congestion, it's not meant to be congestion in the sense of like this flow is experienced congestion. Please have your congestion controller respond to it. This is a higher level signal That's, we're going to talk about that later in the charter. Does that answer your question? I think we'll talk about it later but it's a very good answer for what you're thinking thinking"

Because there is a big difference between let's say, the low latency in such a video conference, as you said, and then some you know over the top video which is happy to have to second play out and I think whatever these other distinguishing properties are that we do want to capture within the work would be best not to be, you know, pointed to some abbreviation that people may think differently about but explicitly in the charter Okay, yeah, I mean... Long, short, latency, whatever these factors are. Sure. Just to be clear, the our definition of ABR is rather, uh, general insofar as it literally means that a client is a able to switch between different video encodings as part of a given video playback or video experience. No, understood, but then you been doing, let's say, or I, as one reader, has been doing video playout with 10 seconds and think everybody does that and people come up and say no we want to have very low latency, right? And then people disagree on whether both of these things should be in scope, right? So let's make clear that we don't have a disagreement on what it means. Sure Hello, this is luis contreras from Telephonic I have a question and one comment The question is about privacy. You have focused the privacy from the perspective of the user, but I was wondering what about the privacy from the perspective of the provider? so somehow the information that could be exposed could be used I mean for different purposes. So probably we need also to do have some emphasis on the privacy from the perspective of the career And the comment is about the neutrality"

So that would be something to think about separately with that hasn't really, that hasn't come up exactly um net neutrality i agree it's a large topic. It's one that it's not, we can talk about that as part of the charter, but I think just historically with the IETF like but this isn't a regulatory or a policy body it doesn't and as far as I know they IETF's not in the habit of making recommendations about policy, and so it's a little bit tricky to put something like that in scope because it's not strictly protocol or in internet engineering so it's definitely something to think about because we're real people that you know run things on the internet.

I'll read it The insert name here, working groups primary objective, is to specify a maximum achievable through property for quick-based streaming video and an on-path protocol for securely communicating this property from a network device to an client endpoint. Now I've heard suggestions that client and whatever else may not be appropriate, hold those for the discussion but just keep that in mind All good? Not all else as a clarifying question question Langez-Egris, I'm in the on-situ's slower Why only quick-based? Ah, quick for now. Sorry the basic premise of this. We'll get to that Yeah So solution characteristics, there's a lot of these and I'll go through"

What was identified during? the discussion was that having a flow associativity is what we particular flow of in this case quick-based packets would be subject to the not the connection, not the client not the person none of those sorts of things that network can really only see flows And that's the, that's an important thing to understand Single communication channel for both the interactions here and network properties and the network sends those network properties Steven. It says the same communication channel same as what? Exactly That needs to be worked out Okay, so we don't know? I think this is a a... Matt has a solution that is put up it's a straw man, essentially, that says, the same UDP flow, which would be same destination same source and destination IP address and ports and same address family probably in V6 the same flow market and various other things like that that The answer is not clear to me still, but maybe it's just me. So let me try and clarify the answer The charter doesn't specify. It leaves open to the working group to figure out the answer to that question but it seems that we have exam proposal, straw man proposals that indicate both types of solutions would certainly be viable to build Does that answer the question?

It doesn't have to be the same communication channel as the end-to-end traffic It's just that the client uses some way of identifying itself to the network and the network responds on that same channel Does it make it more clear? clear? Okay. Okay, Martin I think Trivost is next. Let's avoid jumping in the discussions if we can at all, please Pellas trying to formulate this as understanding So you folks are assuming for the charter that the place where you know, this magic needs to happen, the network does allow scaling wise for per flow operation both in terms of providing the bandwidth as well as doing the signaling. Is that what I interpret? on that? That's essentially what these three things Which I think is fine as an assumption, I think, whether or not the solution then actually does need to use that is, I think, a charter bashing discussion later on martin duke, connection ID in enthusiast. I'm sorry, I don't think the slide matches the words I think you used, Martin. Are we talking about questions? connections or like? UDP four tuples, slash five tuples? Because obviously these are not the same thing Right. And that is something that working group will have to.

So if we put in the chart, that this is related to specific quick connections, and we decide that we're going to actually map it to something else, that seems a bit weird. There are multiple streams, which you could read as flows, per quick connection and matthew quick connection itself can hop across four to twoples. I think we're spending too much time on this This wording changed relatively recently. It used to say flow and we decided that flow was too vague, but it seems like now we've decided that quick connection is now like either too specific or too vague or depending on you ask so i just think we could probably move on from this the the intention here is that, you know, it's related to, it's related to a existing thing that was in the network, which is in practice a quick connection So, but we're kind of getting into semantics here just we're way behind time so if we remove flow association as an added to this charter, right now and make this sentence will be 100% clear that it relates to it specific quick connection, which is pretty well defined would that that resolve this issue well they will remove the ability to mark against the four-tupil. And I just want to remind- folks, can I remind folks that one of the goals of Quick was to make it said that the network could not distinguish between multiple flows in the same connection? So it is surprising if we are now chartering a thing that is planned You're 100% right. We just use the word flow here, wrong You're right. Did you use flow wrong or connection wrong? I can't tell We used flow wrong and probably connection wrong too So what I suggest we do right now is show this particular one. This is a topic we've come back to during the decision session.

I had a question on the previous slide about maximum achievable throughput and if the Hi, this is John Varsanek, YouTube. I had a question on the previous slide about maximum achievable throughput, and if there's a stance on sort of building more information about what that means, is it like expected to be a hard limit or over some sort of bandwidth connection as we use it in terms of defining quick i believe that that again would be something that the working group would would be discussing what I've heard here is the max use it in terms of defining quick I believe that that again would be something that the working group would would be discussing what I've heard here is the maximum achievable throughput is typically somewhat messy and flexible in some cases some cases. Some cases it's absolutely very, very hard In other cases, there's some sort of squish involved, particularly in certain network environments where the network might find it advantageous to let someone temporarily exceed that limit for some amount of time And that's so I think that's in scope for discussion. Thanks Thank you christian huitema. Your definition of quick connection appears cool but what does it include the use of matthew quick multipower? extensions? May I request that you bring that back to the discussion as I previously requested that we do later? I understand this is a challenging and complicated topic but we're shelving it for now, okay?

Once again, the charter doesn't specify this, the working report Well, but I mean, it's, for me, it's So, to be clear, as Matt described, this is not congestion control. It's not on the time scale of a round trip time or something along those lines. This would be on a longer time frame, and no one has specified that yet and the working group should be able to make the decisions about that. Please put that in the shutter Put that in the Charter. Can someone take a note of that? That's a reasonable If we get through the charter, maybe we can do that. Yeah do that. Miria, at this point, I'm going to start to cut I just quickly wanted to add a point that this quick connection thing is not we don't need something to identify which packets belong to a certain connection because that's what people are worried about because the client will request this information The reason why we have it in the charter is because we want to have a solution that works for quick traffic that's the most important point. I think we need to clarify Moving on So we have On Path to the earlier discussion. Please don't come back to that just yet.

TCP style security is potentially important here, but confidentiality, integrity and authenticity doesn't really cover it it Question, I think it is. christian huitema? You told me to come back so I'm going back. I think you should strike number seven And the reason I say that is quick is specifically designed so that pass that different use of different paths cannot be correct So by definition, your specification of number seven requires that you break that property And I don't see think we should have that in the shorter so I think this comes back to the question about flows, connections and what"

No, it's not okay to have that in the proposed charter. Okay. We're noted Noted think it's a little bit problem with the wording here just a quick clarification When we say resilient and net rebinding, quick connection migration and so on, it's that the client might migrate to different paths and might receive different signals from different paths. And the client should be able to handle that. It's not that the network should be potentially aware that this is a client that comes from one path to another. So I think it's a, it's like different I was told that we should have that conversation later Yes But we're later is like 15 minutes from now. Not long, not much later All right. So this is really new since last time we meant out of scope So streaming video flows in. Transportance other than quick, out of scope For now. And always reach out of support for other types of media that require extra properties rather than simply the maximum achievable throughput Things like jitter and delay and all this as well rather than simply the maximum achievable throughput.

Okay. There's a much better write-up of it on the comments. There is a line here that's going to be a little bit difficult for a working group to work through. The idea of having a charter in this area is to establish a sort of guideline. And then obviously when it comes to rate adaptation and congestion control, and the continuum between them there will necessarily be some some amount of discussion within the working group about where the line is And that's okay, that's healthy. The idea here is to explicitly carve out and say, we're not doing not doing ECN we're not doing LFRS we're not doing any of those things. And we're only dealing with longer time scale rate adaptations So those things are in scope for the charter in scope for a working group to discuss we don't need to have very precise definitions of these things Otherwise, we end up with long lines at the mics, just like we have right now I just want to think, one out one, two things is too, it's word not reporting the current bandwidth or the current congestion or any of those things.

Can we agree that connection? has a connection ID? Yes. I might change that connection ID, and it would still be the same quick connection, but the network wouldn't know right? Yes. Okay, so we already know that quick connection are not the same as application connections Yep. Within a given quick connection, I can have multiple streams some of those streams might be abr and some of the streams might not be ABR. Yep the network provider cannot distinguish between those streams because they're all within the same quick connection. Yep. So the quick connection is neither one single stream nor multiple streams. Yep. Nor a linkage between streams. It's none of those things And yet we are trying to associate semantics for one ABR flow against a thing that is not that, manifestly not that for anything that the network operator can currently distinguish. So either we're chasing something that doesn't exist or we're trying to break the properties of Quick and describe a different scenario to the network operator than Quix currently describes. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but my understanding so far, I guess, like, okay, if you get something from the network, on Iscon Pro, it actually the application needs to handle, like, how, the network doesn't know which flow within a quick connection it a VR or not. That is still valid. It's like application or information.

So how do we reframe? this? They don't want to look at any of that information So, I mean, I think we could say this quick connect... We could say that the signal that we're proposing here I'm not sure that I want this either, but we should say the signal we are proposing is that a client that uses a quick connection may signal that matthew quick connection contains ABR, not is ABR because there are multiple streams, right, right? And then the network operator has the opportunity to tell the client, hey, this quick connection that we are talking about has the following limits, whatever those things are That, I think, is a coherent frame, but it has nothing to do with flows in the sense that application layer thinks of flow So what you just described is, was the intent, which is to say that this contains a B.R video, because the idea here is that this is an alternative to what's currently being done, which is that that information is coming implicitly from, they see a quick flow, they extract the S&I, they say, oh, look, this matches an S&I that I have determined has ABR video. They could contain other stuff too, but they don't care. It says the S&I, says it's video, so I've decided it's video. Okay, so I had actually said ABR and didn't say video. I think it's deeply weird that we would not want to have adaptive bit rate for other things and that we would want to signal, hey, I'm watching a video stream. Why would we do that? I could, I can"

That's adaptive bit rate, and I don't want to signal that that's distinct from video so the reason it's limited to video is one because these practices are current only really applied to video, and two, because by limiting the scope to just that, it makes the problem clearer rather than you know there these these these a nice theoretical example that, like, a high bandwidth stream of financial data, that's not something that's currently done. So, like, we could have something that says it's more generic, but more generic problem is harder to charter clear scope around, whereas video is like a known thing that people kind of understand Let's move forward in the line here. Thanks So, gorry fairhurst, enthusiasm for having more information to tell people what bit rate is the maximum but agree with what was just said, right? I mean, we're talking about a pipe here. It may contain one floor, it may contain many flows. It could be masked. It could just be a whole palette people what bit rate is the maximum. But agree with what was just said, right? I mean, we're talking about a pipe here. It may contain one floor. It may contain many flows. It could be masked. It could just be a whole pile of other stuff that includes ABR traffic And I really think we should be talking about ABR traffic. We're not tagging this as a video. We don't know what that pipe contains I do have a little knit. Okay, um, you want to come back on that one? Look, I think it's obvious this thing, he doesn't even have a mechanism to detect whether it's video or something else. So look, let's let's work on the assumption We'll update the charter to be ABR traffic is where it's relevant And look, you need your traffic's not ABR, you can find out, still find out what the rate of ABR traffic might have been, right? So, you know, I think that's the reality of where we are, right? Okay, okay, and I think we should also just everybody in line, proceed on when we will, you know, get this very clear There is no intention to look inside of anything that would be normally be encrypted by a quick connection. This does not change quick in any way or that sort of one, right? I think that's also sort of everyone's on the same page there, though our words are not and I want to try the second one again"

If we can just make it so that the client can ask the network, Hi, what bandwidth do you recommend I use to connect? to Netflix? And then, there is no need to, the enforcement mechanisms are operate on the four double layer the information that we're providing is advisory the client can then be a behave better from the perspective of the network, and there's no need to connect it to the connection itself because if the client can ignore this information anyway so this isn't going to change anything about how the network treats the connection All we really need to provide is a way for the client to ask some advisory information about a connection.

It's just not a random message by some third party off, you know, you have prove that it's in a place that could actually do this enforcement. It's just not a random message by some third party off, you know, UFO.

So I think that that was I'm speaking for the proponent here slightly, but I think that that was sort of one of the underlying things to say, you know, well, it's an on path connection thing this the thing that's sending you this information can effectively prove that it could be doing this rate shaping, that it's, it could enforce this upper bound that is claiming.

I guess, quick carrying four tuple is the lingo now? or is that a endpoint cap? Or don't we know yet? If it is tied to the four-touple, it incentivizes opening multiple four tuples which exposes additional information to an observer about what you're doing, because you can't hide your stuff in one quick connection anymore. Sounds like a great conversation for working group to have yes so i think we need to put this in the charter. I think we really need to know what information is this carrying because it really, you know on the mechanism we're going to build Mike build Mike. mike bishop, Akamai. I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that the parties in this protocol have different things that they can see and we're used to having protocols be a little more equilateral that the client knows what a connection is the network path elements don't only the other endpoint does and same thing with ABR.

But the second point the single communication channel, I didn't read that is the on path for the actual application flow.

I'm not a I'm not I have no personal involvement in this work So just as an observer, I think that video is extra special in a way that maybe we haven't totally grappled with here because the video systems will naturally use all available bandwidth on the link for the entire duration of the usage time if allowed. Essentially, the bit rate can just go to infinity. This is very different from a file transfer or any of the sort of classic things the TCP congestion control was designed for. So because of that, we need to think about the way it uses data in the network very differently And that's why I think it does make sense that this charter, talks about video directly It's also why we can't just speak in very general terms about conveying interesting information about things that are happening on the network because the point is that there are policies that are being implemented in some ways on the network that are specific to video Because for things like a file transfer, they don't make sense the operator wants you to download your file as fast as possible and get it over with if the bandwidth is available right now but with video giving you more bandwidth just uses more bytes in total. So, it doesn't pay off in the same way The one thing that I am confused about stuff, from the charter is really, uh, point three, that the information is supposedly only flowing from the network to the client but I hear hints in this charter that there's also some sort of indication from the client to the network or from maybe from the server that this flow is going to attempt to comply with that limit and therefore that the network might if it has sufficient faith in that signal"

The reason that a bunch of network operators have deployed rate limiting traffic shapers is that video was so much such a high percentage of their traffic So that's why people are coming to the table because they have a real problem that needs solving i don't I'm not saying that the solution that gets built here has to be you know if it's not video it must not work But I think putting in the scope of the charter, it must be designed for video, makes a lot of sense. That's the problem we're solving If someone uses other creative uses for it later, that's fine That's great.

It could be an entire household behind a NAT. It could be my phone with my bunch of you know, tabs open on this browser or my phone with a laptop behind it on a hotspot So there's going to be multiple applications going on for what the network considers a user.

So my understanding for why there's flow here, which I think it should be is that the notion of the shaper today, only applies to some of these, and this solution should maintain that property I think we probably want to drop the notion of like quick connections in there because the privacy implications that we're just discussed are true we don't like we want to be able to migrate in a way that the network doesn't know.

I think that's relatively clear It seems to me like there's some some questions we want to ask about the general topic, but I think this is going to be about this very difficult question of scope and applicability that we need to resolve And that's not going to happen here today clearly, in a number of conversations that we'll need to continue on that one What questions do we want to ask? I mean, sorry, Miss Mike here I'm not, I'd like to sort of, you know, confirm"

    "text": "consensus and we'll figure out how to phrase the question correctly here in a second. I'm not trying to phrase it right now but it does seem that we're fairly confident with moving this to be very clear that this is about a, you know, UDP-2 pler, or floor tuple, however we phrase it, that that's the network information of what we're connecting to here. That's what's visible by the network that's this and, you know, make it clear that there's no intention in any way to be looking inside of the things that Quick is protecting for it by the network that's this and, you know, make it clear that there's, there's no intention in any way to be looking inside of the things that Quick is protecting with its security guarantees. So I like to sort of some of that. It also seems, so that's sort of one question I'd like to go on. People are like, no, no, no I couldn't live with that In fact, I'm not sure we need any questions. Is there anyone in the room that would really strongly object to moving the charter? to be that, to be worded very clearly that way? fact, I'm not sure we need any questions. Is there anyone in the room that would really strongly object us to moving the charter to be that, to be worded very clearly that? Okay, I'm not seeing one leap up Now, the next set of information that seemed interesting came up here but was a bunch about the, does the client even need to reveal to the network? it's interested in this type of information? okay or does the network just always provide if the network's the type of network that provides this information to some of its 5-2 bullshit? that provides it to some, you know, all of its 5-2 pulse, like that would be fine right? So, uh, know, I think that that does have the thing that existing clients today that don't support this mechanism are suddenly going to start reset that does have the thing that existing clients today that don't support this mechanism are suddenly going to start receiving some packets they don't understand, right? That's the tradeoff there. So does anybody want to, so are people okay with us just moving the charter to be like you're going to get the information unsolicited? unsolicited about this rate limit for network? that decide to support it? Is that anyone? object strongly to that, us moving the charter that direction? And eliminating this one directive, the upstream sort of signal. Go for it, Mary. Oh, sorry we're doing too many things at once as chairs here. But go to the mic anyway"

I saw some other thumbs up Okay This is spencer dawkins. I just wanted to follow up after Mirius thing. So the were thinking that this information would be coming to the client through a quick connection so if a client has not opened a quick connection to find this information out, we would not be, it would not be receiving it, would it? would it you're deep into the solution space you know the job here. I'm sure we can introduce. I was just saying, just the architecture, like, how do you, how do you sense? would not be receiving it, would it? You're deep into the solution space beyond the job care. I'm sure we can introduce. I was just saying, just the architecture, like how do you send something on a surprise quick connection? ICMP manages to do it all the time. Okay Can I provide some reasoning? Because Steven, you said, if there is a working solution for that and I think we don't know that yet so you know we cannot put it in a charter because we're not there I agree with what you said But for me, that implies we shouldn't charter anything if there's no solution that has the right properties. I think we're got there's going to be a clear range of opinions here. I don't even need to take a poll I can like look at people's like expressions on their faces and see that there's a range on that one. Okay, next on the cue was Moe. Can we bounce to Mos and Addie. So just to clarify, Colin's point about unsolicited, I don't think it necessarily has to be unsolicited in the sense of you didn't send a single packet the client didn't send a single packet. I think it could be generally so that on any outbound connection that a client makes with some optional indicator in that outbound connection that I'm willing to accept scone pro data that any network entity can come back and signal on that connection that this is the limit so i i don't think that's not unsolute"

Is this information signals before, uh, a client connects to a network at some intermediate time? when it's starting a connection during the connection does the client have to explicitly ask for one piece of information? Does the network tell? it, hey, you can ask for information about this network? over here, or does it just give a big give a big chunk of information, or do we say, you know, you need to you can ask for this information, but go over here to ask for it. And which, you know, do we take do us on the network level or a connection level or whatever? I don't know what we have a wide way into it. Yeah, yeah, I don't need your point. It's good correct answer to this i don't think that's a correct answer to this i don't think it should go in the charter I think it should be one of the first discussions we have once chartered on excellent. At what point and how? To catch you hand Take care, Jay. daniel huang Gilmore. So I think Mo made a really good point about that we need to understand the scope of whatever the shaper is connected to And I think it's also interesting that that's in conflict of little bit with our idea that the on-pathness of the indicator will tell whether or not it's appropriate for them to send these signals so that is the big issue So if the signal that's being sent here from the network to the device is going to say anything about like a"

Like device ID, most of the network doesn't know the device ID It doesn't want to know the device ID Last comment, Hangshin, we've got one question to ask people before we on. Yeah, Hengshin from Pauli I think it's very difficult for the network to send a random packet to our client, especially if he's behind an IT device. I mean, what? connection need to be initiated by the company? At least some kind of pops up indications So I think it's very difficult for the answer unsolidated approach to work Thanks We've heard a bunch of things here, but there's really a poll we'd like to take at this point in the last two minutes which is do you think that there is something in this space that we can come to some consensus about in terms of the problem statement that has been presented here and I will phrase this very simply in a show of hands hands just to give a general sense of the Now may not be that everyone agrees that how we should work on the problem is exactly the same way. I'm just talking about that general shape of this thing And given that we are now"

Well, yeah, so looking at the poll, I think there is some interest on like, well, we'd like to work on this, but definitely we have a lot of discussion on the charter, so we'll be working on charter So let's update the Charter and let's start discussion on the SAS CD and mailing lists, right? And then see like where it takes us yeah and we've had a lot of constructive feedback during the session so i think it was really see like where it takes us. Yeah, and we've had a lot of constructive feedback during the session, so I think there's a lot of work. It was really good. Thanks for doing this. I mean, it's really good. Thank you and see you on the list"
