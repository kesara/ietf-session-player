So slight slight schedule change, but I guess it says it's a bit Okay. So here's the note. Well, I guess this is the first time you've seen it this week. It tells you to you know, we should behave. There are rules about IPR. there's a whole bunch of rules, and they're all linked up there. and That's but Like I say that this is the lake slot. We're sharing the session slot with Ace,"

So just a status check with the ad hoc draft, which are kind of main work item and date. is out of the working group. Our AD had a a good idea and with which the work group agreed. So it's currently an IETF last call. which will end a week or so, So, again, if you haven't read the adhocrafts It's an ITFS call, and now is a good time to do that. Because of the delayed change we made at hot, the traces draft needs to be redone, that's in maybe talk about it. And the working group, we rechartered that's gone through the ISG process, and the working group is now rechartered to do future work. We haven't really kind of started substantively on that yet, so we talking too much about it today. And this is our agenda for this morning, which is kinda nice, but and obvious. So we'll have a A a status check on the ad hoc and last call comments. I'm not sure if you've actually gotten any on the Last call lists so far. Not that I know of. Yeah. Well, that's a good thing.

And most of the updates are based on the AD review. and some cleanups of old issues. So we closed all the issues. on the GitHub tracker. And as we already mentioned here, that we're waiting for last call comments to come in. So there's 3 slides about about the latest updates. So here's the summary. And of the new version, And the main changes were encryption of CR in message 2, And there's a new arrow code for unknown reference credential. new subsection. And those are described in the following two slides. Under were a bunch of minor changes as well. the area code 0 is now explicitly reserved for success, there was a section on Message due deduplication in the appendix, which is moved to the body. Now in in section you should say section 7 there is section numbers. And there were some changes in terminology, aligning terms like a profit called run, exchange, or session were used interchange interchangeably. And now only using the term session. and we moved from discontinued to aborted. So there's, yeah, some alignment of the the terminology. There are also some clarifications in particular when derive application keys, So that was an and something that the implementers had different views on, so we were made clear on on when that's allowed to happen."

Two headers cose headers are introduced in this document it's it's 1 for CBAR web tokens and 1 for CBAR web token. claim sets. but the security considerations for those who are missing. So that's been added in version 20. that's things like I mean, the c CS that's CWT claims set is essentially a raw public key. So you you're sending that as a credential, you need to know that there has to be some other way of establishing trust. So that's the example of the content of those security considerations and some updated references. So those were the minor changes, and then we had the 2 main changes. The first one was on encryption of CR, So as you remember, the connection identifier, CI, CR are are used to simplify for the receiving party to retrieve pro the protocol state to get the security context in place to to to process the message, those are defined by the initiator and responder. respectively in message 1, message 2 And in message 1, there is no way of encrypting c CI because there is not enough There's no case based to base that encryption on. But in message 2, there are actually piece I mean, this is encrypted at message, so it is possible to encrypt CR. which wasn't done. And and the reason for that is that a typical use case is that you actually use CR in plain text in message 3. So because of the nature of these connection identifiers is to be a plain text handle that you could use to look up security context. They can't typically be encrypted,"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:10:05",
    "text": "but they can actually in in message too. And that that since we are on the premises of always trying to encrypt as much as possible when when possible, we also decided to encrypt CR. So this was one of the proposals from the AD review, and there were also consensus in the working group. to do so. And that's so simply I mean, simply from a specification point of you move the CR under the encryption into the plain text of of message 2. and also fairly simple in in implementation, but the entire traces draft need to be redone, of course, by this change And there's also another change in the in the spec that relates to transcript hash. So the transcript task is needed to derive the keys to to decrypt message too. So you can't think if the CR is now encrypted, can't have it included in the transcript but it's included in the plain text of message 2, so it goes into the transcript task number 3. So it's included in the transcript hash. but it's moved from th2toth3. So that's essentially the change. made. when it comes to the encryption of CR And then we have the final Main change, which was a new error code. I already mentioned this explicitly reserved value, but more Bigger change was this new error code. This is thanks to review comment by Brian Cipos, Very good comments. Thank you very much for those. And in particular, this comment, which is a a type of action that we'd like to support with error codes. So you may remember, error codes were only defined for the cases where we foresee"

    "startTime": "00:12:02",
    "text": "some automated remediation so that the receiving party could automatically fix the with the error information of the error, actually, do something and which results in a successful session. And this was one example where this could happen. So the the new error code numbers with Validate 3 is saying meaning unknown credential referenced. So it could be used, for example, in the case when that the endpoints are using multiple credentials or credential ref either a credential or a credential reference So the first time, the endpoint are contacting each other. They use the credentials certificate chain, for example, or certificate. And then the next time, they are only using the reference. But then it might be a case when the certificate chain or the certificate is is lost or deleted for space reasons in the constrained device. So you only have you don't have the reference the the actuals credential available then you can use this error code to indicate that the absolute. grammatically is missing. which means that with this error code, you can more more easily use references the greater freedom, and that's good because the new are are using less less data transported. So we thought it was a very good idea, and and it's not intuitive. And with that, all the main also minor changes. I think I have sketched So that's the last slide of this presentation. Are there any more questions on the latest version? So we set some point in the you briefly, but I don't know if that was by mistake."

So quick this is a quick recap. about the state of the draft and what's it about. So the setting here is essentially taking the ACE workflow and putting it in an ad hoc OScore context So we previously have a DTLS profile. We have a TLS profile. We have OScore only profile, and this is the ad hoc and OScore profile. And this slide is illustrating that by means of an example, This is example from appendix a 2, and optimized and optimized workflow? And what we see here is the usual interaction between client resource server and authorization server. We recognize from ace and oAuth where the client is authenticating to the authorization server, in this case, using ad hoc and then establishing the security context for Oscar sending The post token post slash token, restful request to the authorization server and getting an access token back. and some access information. in this case, we're using the combined delivery what ad hoc and andOS core. So this is 2 round trips in total. and then having received the access token, the the client, client runs the ad hoc exchange with the resource server, mean, in this case, It"

So that's the access token that takes the authorization information for for running ad hoc and setting up and the access rights associated with requesting the resources on the resource server. And in the same way as in in the previous exchange, this is combined with off course. So in the second request, to the resource server, there is already the access request. combined with the last message we had talked And then in the Oscar response, there is the enforced access response based on the the rights in the access token if you had this the client has the right to access this resource. So that's basically the message flow in in the optimized version and the state of the of the draft is in version 2. is essentially simplification of version 1, So there are some fewer pages. We have removed the use of the ad hoc key update. function. As you may remember, there were 3 different ways of updating keys in the previous version. And now there is only 2. It's either If you have an OSCORE context, you can use the kudos protocol, the key update for OSCORE, is a core, draft, is a very lightweight way of updating security context, or you could rerun start from the beginning, sort of rerun ad hoc, which has, of course, good security features. in terms of separation of keys and so on. So that's taken taken out the key update, which simplified the protocol, and we also removed out the alternative workflow where the AES posting the token instead of the client. So that's described in a separate draft to be discussed in this session later in the session."

Since then, we went under several 2 revisions essentially to address mainly market lockers review that was sent out on the AACE list. We discussed these re this review in two a century meetings and finally, there was an ACE interim on 6th June 2023. which where we discuss some of the updates that I will be presenting in this presentation. So my goal of of this presentation is essentially to present these resolutions to the issue that we discussed in the interim regarding server side generated private keys and to ask for reviews. of this draft in order that we progress it toward. So the issue that we discussed during the interim was on server generated private keys, and we agreed on the action to take, which is to keep the option of server generated private keys in the draft, but with the big fat warning on on security.

Meaning that if this draft is used together with the ad hoc protocol which is your score uses for mutual authentication of EST client and EST server. We we forbid the usage of server server generated private keys But we leave the option that if the is used with pre shared Oscar context for authentication, meaning that secure cryptographically secure random number generator may not necessarily be available on the device We leave the option that the EST client client may use the server generated private key functions and request So I kindly request feedback on this text whether it can be improved both auditorially and normatively. So please go through it and send any comments to the list or to me privately. The second update in the in the latest version of the draft is related to the security considerations on channel binding.

And ad hocunique byte string is generated through the extra through the ad hoc exporter interface, which relies on the full handshake transcript and is therefore not susceptible to the triple rate kind of attack. So what I did is that we kept the channel binding optional. even though it might not be necessary to protect against a triple shake kind of attack, with an added security consideration in the in the draft.

Otherwise, when creating the group, the group does support the pay wise mode of group of score. we further clarified additional things that group members can do should do cannot do depending on what particular changes happen during the group life in its configuration, and we also clarified possible side effects in terms of group membership for king and whatnot. in case the update to the group configuration is so reckless that results in change in the maximum size. of the identifiers used in the group.

So so Next slide, please. And first, I wanted to go over a bit the motivation and intent and what kind of gap that we want to feel with this work and Yeah. Yes. To start off, what's the motivation Well, there are application scenarios that rely on group communication where you would like a client that to be able to access resources on multiple resource servers. and you can have a secure communication by sharing a set of key material But the question becomes, how can you enforce access control within the group for resources at the servers. And, I mean, if you think about very basic and simple use cases, like a basic lighting control scenario. it may be very much fine to have a straightforward and plain control in the sense that just joining the group"

So there's no fine grain resource control for accessing resources on servicing the group. It's just group membership entails full access to the resources of servers in the group. However, for more advanced use cases, you may very well want a situation where different clients have different access rights, and you would need a more fine grained approach. than that very basic setup. Next slide, please. So what kind of properties would we like in that scenario? What kind of properties do we like for this work? Well, we want to separate these 2 concepts. Number 1 being the membership being a member of the group. and the other is actual access control. So that means that just because your group member that does not give you any specific access rights to resources on servicing the group. So the concepts that are to be separate here are access control to the actual secure group communication channel, meaning you can communicate within the group. because you're a group member, And what this work then covers is how do you have access control to risk to the resource base provided by the servers in the group And I think One thing we are now stressing also in the latest version is that this is very much aligned with the 0 Trust paradigm that is defined in this niche document that we link to. because the point there is that you shouldn't have trust granted implicitly. it should be continually evaluated and More than that, the exit control enforcement should be as granular as possible."

So Another question becomes, so how do you accomplish this? you may think that, okay. What about just creating one security group for each different set of access rights that you want to have which can work. However, the problem there is that it scales very poorly, and it also becomes hard to manage. because this means in practice that if the access rights change, you need to join a a different security group, and you also need to raquee the groups. So, well, why not use the ACE framework which is well, dedicated to this purpose of rider access control. So there's already work here on the point of accessing the secure group communication channel, meaning joining the group and provisioning key material to the members such that they can communicate in the group with group of score and that's done in this ASK Groupcom, Oscar document. So that exists and that that is already defined But then it comes to what we wanna do in this work, which is defining how you do fine during access control to the resource space of the resource servers in the group and that's what's missing. And if you look at the current profiles of ACE, none of them cover secure group communication between the client and the RSS. And while none of them use Grupo score as the security protocol, So, essentially, the profile to accomplish this is missing, and that's the profile where now wanting to create Next slide, please.

So that's, like, that's a separate procedure. that's assumed to have happened first. then once you're in the group and you have your in the group, Now this work will provide access control for resources in the group. And what it accomplishes is that we are binding the access token to an already existing group of course security context. we're also binding it to the authentication credential of the client that the client is using within the group for communication. and some properties that the profile achieves is while we approve our session of the client's private key, and that happens when The first time a group of score requests from the client is verified. And yes, a note. We also support both the group mode and pair wise mode of group as core. group score has 2 modes. both of those are supported. So we also have a proof of group membership for an exact client. and we also achieve mutual authentication, and that will happen upon completion of the 1st group of score exchange. Yep. Next slide, please. Yeah. So I wanted to show here overview of the protocol flow. So, basically, course, if you know Ace, you may recognize a lot of the steps here.

So we're binding the access token to the identity of the client and the identifier of the group. and then, yeah, you proceed as but similar to normal ace flow. and you post the token to the resource server. And after you have done that, now you can actually start communicating using glucose core, in this case. of course, that can be either you're going to a resource server unicast, but you can also now, of course, take advantage of multicast and perform a group request to a to multiple resource servers at the same time, And if you want more detailed content of the external well, the content of the message is exchanged.

And one thing we did actually was we use to have this appendix that was quite big on what we call the dual mode. where we were allowing for combined usage of Oscar and Grupo score using this single profile, you could use both of those as security protocols but we realized that yes, it may be better just to focus this"

And, yeah, another thing that we did was to stress again that we are aligned with this 0 trust paradigm And we're really in in harmony with with how they needs recommends that you you, you know, perform 0 trust. again, this is about not implicitly granting trust, but explicitly checking it and continually evaluating it. We also did some other things on the more, let's say, Mm-mm. protocol details. And one thing we updated here was the format of the public authentication credentials.

And this is it. for now, what you're seeing now should be already fairly stable, and this is to understand, we have some more ideas in mind as especially in the parameter side that right now are compiled as open points and ideas appendix be of the document So the next steps are really building of those and and see if we can add more if it's really that that that that useful and useful needed. This is especially in the interest of showing that the alternative workflow can be used for as many and, in general, old, profiles of ways and that also more advanced operations like updating Alexa's rights and token reports remain possible to perform. and this may together with other reason lead, of course, to the definition of some more parameters than the 3 We have now. till then, we'd appreciate any comments and feedback. Thank you."

    "text": "Hello? Hey, Dave Robin. great presentation, Marco. I am from the back net community very excited to see this because We solved this problem in a different way, and we had this exact same problem. And but the AS pushes the tokens down into the RS ahead of time for on behalf of clients that can't get their own tokens for some reason. But here is a case where the client is willing to but It's already been pushed. down there. And so and this basically says, don't bother. I've already send it because we had to go to so much trouble if the client gets a token, and it's in somewhat conflict with the one that was pushed earlier, which one wins. In other words, he presents a token, but one's already there. that kind of thing. So Anyway, I'm I'm excited to see this work go forward. Our document just on our public review, which means we can change it. So if if some stuff works here out, that's a better way of doing it, we're really excited to see that, and we can add that to our next version. So fully support this direction. It's it's great. things, I appreciate. So I believe that We could also issue a call for adoption for this one. Okay. No questions. So I guess when we'll lose one is"

Please go ahead. Yep. Yep. So I'd like to bring these 2 open issues that we found in ace. The first one is the validation of the authorization server problem. And the second one is the how to register the client to the AS problem. Next slide, please. So this is the this is about the communication between the client and the AS. So in section 5.1 of RFC 9200, it did it it it it talks about the that the client who request for the access token before that before this step the client sender, you unauthorized initial resource request to the to the RS. So and in response to that, it gets it gets the identification of the AS or for example, like ASUI. the question here here is that how does the authorization server validates the that so sorry. How does the client validates that this is the right authorizing server that it is in order to communicate with Yep. Next slide, please. Yeah. Here. Yeah. Here in in the talk and request response. This is the step that I just mentioned. So before this step, the client gets the AS URI from the RS. And how does the client and say, say it it it is the right AS to to"

Next slide, please. Yeah. This can be connected with the client stretching problem. So this is also between c and client and the authorization server. were the The secure channel is established which which is defined in the 9202. were in section 3.1, and it is expected to that the client is expected to register with the AS before, say, it before sending an access token request or like sending a request for the access token and also sending sending in the key materials, for example. to to establish the secure general So how to how do we do this? or how how the client is how the client is expected to register. So there were some solutions I I've seen an in for example, the key material, like manual configuration or autonomy automated provisioning process. So this whole situation can be considered can be referred as client registration issue. And It can also be considered as part of onboarding, onboarding problem or say bootstrapping. or can also be say referred as enrolling. Yep. Next week, So I'd like to bring up this mining station use case to discuss these 2 problems. So we have a say, we have a truck a smart truck, which is the client. and the mining station, which is the resource server. and the to us the truck sending resource request to the to access to get the resource"

And the truck establish secure channel and as for the access token. for for the for for this particular mining station. So the question is, like, how does the truck know this is the right a s, that it is that it has to go to. and how does the truck. No. This is a yeah. The right AS that it has to that that is that is honored to produce the access tokens for this particular mining station. So one possible solution or the suggested 1 or, I mean, selected 1 is to include a delegation step from the contractor. Here, the contract is the device owner or the owner of the smart truck. So when we include a step delegation step from the d o device owner to the truck so that that so that it can include some client some credentials. to the send some credentials to the Chuck that the truck can use that to identify or to validate the AS And, also, say, it can use the this credential to credentials to register with the authorization server Next slide, please. yeah, there are there are other possible solutions that spread in different RFCs. These are the one that I could that we could find. So so one one possible solution is that the client has asking the Dior device owner. Like, it gets the AS URI from the resource server, and it's asking the deal. Okay. This is the one that I got. right now. And is this is this a legacy meter? resource sorry, s s."

So, say, the client got a list of trusted AS so that it can cross stack yeah, and and validate the AS. And another one is the delegation of access, right, which is which is the one that they mentioned discussed use using the use case of mining station, which is the delegation of the access rate excess rights from the device on or to the client. So POA based authorization, like a power of attorney based authorization, which explained. in detail in the draft is can be considered as part of can be considered as delegation of access right techno technique. And similarly, like, the the client registration problem, one solution e which is mentioned somewhere. is the dynamic client registration. Yeah. then the allocation of access same same one delegation of facts. Right? If the d do delegate the client that the client can use this credentials to register with the with the And if we consider the client registration problem as part of the onboarding, issue. There there are also some other serotouch provisioning methods as well. Next slide, please. I think that yeah. That's the last one. So any comments this problems. Nothing urine. is so Yeah. Hi.

The setting with a POA based delegation. How is that offline What do you mean by far? Yeah. It means that the for example, the dedication can be provided in terms like, a self contained token. from the device owner to the client. So that the the device on or does it need to be online all the time during the authorization process. or a or a or a you know, the when the client asking for access tokens from the from the authorizing server the device or does it need to be online? That's what I meant by offline mode. So but then you that means that you need to have all the delegations or all the POAs available then from the start if you're offline. Yes. Or or so there is no I just wonder how the mechanics work. So if you If you get an if the RS provides back an an AS identifier or the main name or something like that. And you need to be provisioned with all the potential AS is that you would Or or is it only the sort of a very small set you're looking at, and and then you can have this offline. Yeah. One solution is that can take the AS information from the RS and cross check with what's what's given from the d d o device owner. or we can just omit the step of going towards RS and asking for information. if possible. I'm not sure about that, but using the as information inside the POA. to provision."

No. I just wanted to take one step back and what you explained there, 3 especially if you looked at this mining, use case that we had to slide on. for this you show that slide, please? Now next slide. next this this Got it. This one. So so so the overall idea of a POA is same as in the real world when we humans use POA. So in this case, assumption is that there is pre established trust relation between the contractor and the authorization server or the owner of your authorization servers. So then the contractor can send, like, 1000 of smart tracks to this site and when the AS is going to verify that it's a valid track then the truck carries a POA which is self contained and signed by the contract run the contract with known, by the AS. So it's it's very much like I send the proxy to a meeting, instead of me it the good person carries the POA. So it's exactly the same here, but are dealing more with with devices. And then this POA can contain additional information like for example, which AS that should be used that could be pre established information between the contractor and the AS owner. So Yes. Your on your comment is really good. Things are pre established."

I hope that clarifies a bit. Thanks. Yep. Thanks. Thank you. any more comments? So I just wonder what type of so so what what is the But, basically, the component you would like to bring here, is is it a a format for delegation or or is it a protocol or what is the what is it you see to be added here. I mean, we've we've already mentioned that some of these things can be solved by an onboarding procedure and and And but you you seem to have an idea that this is a good pay, to solve the problems but it is what what is the contribution that you would like to standardize. Actually, the onboarding is, like, very big issue, I mean, It's not the contractor here is not the manufacturer as in onboarding, case. So this is just the part of how the device owner can delegate It's on trusted device. to to to the authorization server or to another third party. network or something like that. and mostly concentrating on this. how to delegate or how how can we make a device work on behalf of a device owner."

But let's just said, we we want to standardize the format of the POA, and that that's be only the basic because POAs can be different from case to case. but there will be some kind of base format. And then, of course, a base protocol also. for how you interacts and send this but that should not be very complicated. It's essentially a yeah, assigned, textual document. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right? We have a question for Marco. Right? Sorry? Oh, So your hand is raised. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for the presentation. If all is preconfigured in the interest of being offline. you don't really expect any error message coming from well, the money station, in this case, there is some server pointing to n. Yes. In an maybe noncredible way. You just know your authorization, servicing, events, you have no pointers to really validate. You just have your list of good ones. Right? you mean the how does the RS, no, this is the right days. Yeah. So you don't expect anymore to just try with the resource service and getting an probably non valid indication of a of an AES to validate somehow. You just need your valid authorization service in advance, Yeah. I mean, there there are issues from from the opposite, like, from AS to the client or from from from from from"
