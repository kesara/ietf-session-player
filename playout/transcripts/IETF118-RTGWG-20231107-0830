So for example, I note, that there's no sort of decent guidance about how you have a synchronized view on how long you should remain each of the, the conversion States. I I think there's a strong case that this draft or another approach needs to be incorporated in or copublished with the, routing TILFA draft.

Because we know that without the macro group of voyage, you, you destroy the fast reroute, parameters. During the conversions process. Y, tend to disagree with because this solution is already deployed for many years in many places and you say advice people to deploy you would actually say something that's actually quite late It's already deployed.

Sasha are you there? Peter, Peter, Francisco. Hi, Stuart. So, I tend to agree here with Bruno. TLFA as such doesn't cause micro loop. Micro loop is caused by the post conversion switching to post convergence pass. As soon as you are on the TLF, I pass your fine. So we should not make any conditions for DialFA to progress on any micro loop documents. We can say in a topology where he used TILFA If you switch to post convergence pass, there is a likelihood that you make for a mic total, and you can use any techniques. Can be, you can just be on the backup bus for a longer time or so. There are many other techniques other than the one describing the TL of in the micron loop and stuff. So I would really keep these two things separate Okay. So I think probably what we're coming to is we need an operation inception in the draft, don't we? That provides the guidance to someone deploying this about what the limitations are and how they should address those limitations through a, a micro loop conversion strategy And we probably, by the sound of it should note that"

Another simple approach depending on deep deployment is just do nothing because the user payload is to encrypted the worst cause of the not do nothing is, packet. Some packet will be dropped.

Okay. So this is just the model, what I was saying. And the question is what what sort of things do you need to, talk about in terms of security considerations because of this additional information. Next slide. So this information could be information that you only know at the ingress. Things about what actual port that packet arrived on the ingress node. It's a VLAN tag on it, which might be getting stripped up. It's being moved to IP. Some sort of, customer tenant identification could be at, fluffy or larger granularity. Or it could be information that you'll be forwarding anyway, but because you're planning to encrypt the packet, you actually also add a plain text copy earlier in the so that it can be accessible. During transit or so that it doesn't you don't have to look as deeply into the packet to get to it. Next slide. So this additional information can lead to various threats. Primarily to privacy. This could be due to the surveillance of the links. Between the the nodes or within a a transit or egress node that has been compromised in some way. This you don't have a privacy threat is only the ingress node because we're talking about information, which is all available to the ingress node regardless.

So, yeah, examples of VX land. If you have the the internet or IP addresses and also the VNI, the VNI's should be listed here and it's missing from this. That sort of thing enables you to fairly precisely identify the the, probably the host or PM. At least the tenant. By observing the packet, as it transits through this area. Or at the egress node. Next slide. So what can you do about that sort of thing? What sort of security considerations are there? And the main ways to address, these security threats due to this additional information, our minimization, encryption and obfuscation. And there are also some other considerations related to integrity and authentication and and covert channels. Next slide. So there's this dumb installation here. Minimization is by far the best strategy. If you don't put this additional information into the packet, and you don't have any security threats due to it being there. So whenever you can avoid adding, an additional information, that's the best strategy. Next slide. But if you do have to include then encryption is a good thing to consider. Assuming you use good encryption algorithms and have proper key management, then, this additional information, would otherwise have been in plain text can't be, recovered or observed without having that key and and knowledge of what algorithm is used."

It's hot by hop, and that protects against observation of the link. But doesn't help at the transit nodes or the egress node. You could do encryption from ingress to egress. That will help protect it, but that would obscure the field so that if those fields you're adding might be necessary to determine the routing or the handling of the packet and one of the transit nodes, then that's gonna defeat that. So it'd be such a good idea. If you can't encrypt, something, then you should consider using authenticated encryption with additional data where this data you're adding is considered part of the additional data So it would be authenticated even though not encrypted. But there are some kinds of information about the traffic related to, like, the number of packets and the size of the packets. That it's hard to conceal efficiently. You can add fake packets and you can add padding. And that the the more you do that, the better you you can conceal this information, but that's not a very efficient thing to do. Next slide. So if all the above fails, it it is a some benefit to do some obfuscation. I typically security people are very contemptuous, perhaps, of fascigation, but, you know, there are cases where somebody's, I don't know, debugging a network or something and they they look at packets in some way that interpret the fields or shows them as ASCII or whatever and, might just you know, see something, on their screen or in their logs that you would prefer they don't not trivially get exposed to.

But there is a la there I think there are lack of and overall standard to types of liability mechanisms. So just kangkong just put put up some requirement on the reliability. So I here, I have some proposal on the solutions. In this draft, we mentioned 3 mean, network elements about SFC that is classifier and SFF and also assess and focus on the link be link failure between the SF and SF F and also the failure of the SF So we have 3, 3 mechanisms to cope with those fake those faults.

That is the failure between SF 1 and SF. So So we have to, direct the traffic from the SFM 1 to the SF 2. Zem, So the the the the traffic will be handled by the SF. So in this stereo, because the because it is that mode, SRH and payload mapping relationships are preconfigured So FS SFFone can remove the original the SRS 6 header, and then redirect the traffic to the standby SF 2. There are 2 options for the redirection. 1 is to directly change the destination IP. That's simple. The other one is to add an additional API with 6 header with the Sih.

So SF 1, we are not remove the original Sih header but here. But but, either by modifying the destination address or adding a extra API 6 header, in assembly, as as as what, you know, you know, later case. When SF 2 needs to remove the outer outer app uv6 header when they to receive traffic. So the traffic will be processed by the SF. Not third one is mass reading mass reading as our as proxy. This is similar to the dynamic proxy approach. But the difference is that the standby SF 2 additional needs to update IPV 6 destination address to the last hop of the s h s h after it receives that message.

That is SF F1. Due to the, it is a static mode, the mapping relationship between the and a payloader is configured beforehand. So the SF 1 can remove the original IP by 6 header and then redirect the traffic to the standby SF 2. Which is this is a difference with, with the the difference between this case and, your homework case, is as a s SID of the source function represents the standby SF Littman. And as a primary SF. Those are Those are different. So there are a similar, there are 2 options for the redirection. One is also just changes the destination IP address. And the other one is to add an extra IP basics header, the rest of the processing is because is a similar with, your homero scenario. To this the the the second case is that dynamic, proxy.

Designed for control plants, the goal was to provide a resilient control plane especially the connectivity for the control plane. So all the fancy things that we wanna do with networks like, doing SDN, and if we, what have you, also AI stuff or intent based network management that requires, solid foundation with respect to connectivity. So you don't want to lose, the control of your network. Especially it's also important to avoid any Circular dependencies while you control the network, and we wanted to support inbound, out of band, or hybrid, control And so the goal is to more or less guarantee the controllability of every network device. We found that the existing solutions are either not scalable or not 0 touch or, topology is specific like risk, for example, in Kira, it could be for example, an alternative routing protocol for the Animas ACP, the autonomous control plane, offering certain advantages over the current envisions, Ripple ACP."

We do not use locators. So there's also no ID locator mapping but we have a trade off, which is stretched. So some route longer than shortest path routes. But it is also tunable. We always have shortest path through the context that are in the routing table of a node so you can actually, as a controller, for example, you are still able to efficiently control your resources. It is 0 touch, which means it doesn't require any configuration, and it is self organizing. So it adapts through whatever technology changes, and also while the network evolves. It uses self signed addresses for that purpose. And has no other dependencies. So what it provides us basically a resilient control plane connectivity based on ipv6 because we wanna embed the IDs into the IPs, etcetera. And, it is loop free even during conversions. Because we're using source routing and path, oriented routing. We found that it works well in and across various topologies speeds, spares, or dens, like data centers. And it's, say it just, it's not hop by hop forwarding. It's based forwarding so you can do any kind of tricks like multipath routing or traffic engineering if you want to this is a rough overview of the architecture.

Even we can have some new notification mechanism Then totally, if we can control the switch over time within Media section 10 maybe 100 microsecond we will dramatically improve the AI training efficiency.

So I think it Now this, draft, we just, give some, problem analysis. We did not give any possible way to solve that. From my point of view, we should do something in both data line and the control line. Maybe some news. Should be reached Yeah.

So it is imperative to have to run this distributed parallel training on thousands or even more, can out the GPUs to join the model. This figure, this figure is a simplified illustration of how yeah, training works. You can see that, the training is repetitive, iteration, and we in each iteration, it has, generally speaking, it has the forward computation and back competition. The communication is always there. Our target is the communication is used to synchronize the gradients among different GPUs and push the AI training going forward. And our target is reduce this communication time in order to increase the GPU session because GPU is the most expensive resource AI training. And looking at the communication characteristics, this table shows some characteristics of a different types of parallelism, which are used in night training. Generally speaking, the of the internodes communication. It can be 0 gigabytes for different types of the parallelisms. Such communication is quite different from what we have today in traditional data center, it should, it requires large bandwidth. It shows manner burst. It does not have, flows, many flows at the same time, but the flow size is big. So please go to the next right So we say that, the AI the API fabric is the GPU to GPU interconnects, for AI training. It's nicer the congestion management. Why was it so?"

    "text": "As mentioned, the shortening communication time is key to the AI fabric. The most straight way we can think about is to increase the bandwidth, right? But what I want to emphasize here is the network bandwidth should be the effective network bandwidth. What does that mean? Assuming we have 800 gigabytes is not for AI fabric. But if several links are very busy and other links are free, the effective network bandwidth is low. Or, if the packet loss leading to manual transmission. The effective network bandwidth is also So what what what I want to say here is we should try to fully utilize the network bandwidth and, increase this report. So that we can increase the computation efficiency Therefore, the congestion management is a must the congestion management includes the congestion control and load the balancing. For load balancing, traditional way to use the ECMP data center, but it does not work for AI fabric because it is easily to hash the elephant flows to the same path. Then adapter routing turns to be a new choice adapter routing dynamically shift the traffic pass or flow based on network status. Actually, in previous IETF meeting 116117, there was a presentation about Dragonfly Dragonfly Plus Apology in that presentation. It also mentioned about adapter routing And at that presentation, at the end of that, it raises several open questions. The first of them is is regarding the depth of routing and schedule. It asks, how to decide what to do, shift, flow, or, adjust congestion. Talk, That is a good question. Although it is raised towards the topology of dragon apply, but I think that it is valid for other topologies like fetch your clothes, which are you also used in AI fabric. Currently, the adapter routing and congest control, they were independently, you do not have coordination. That will"

    "text": "bring some problems to the AI fabric. Please next slide. Before I talk about the issues, 1st, last, we'll get different types of congestion. The fan in congestion, it happens in overscriber topology, like the ingress traffic is bigger than ingress traffic or the traffic sent from the high speed port to low speed port. Then the second is in natural congestion. It is your request to buy in proper load balancing and which may or describe the egress parts. The last in cast, the congested is very famous, multiple senders transmit data same times at the same receiver. In order to explain the following following content, I categorize the in network congestion as the type 1 congestion, the other 2 as type 2 congestion. So we can now we can talk about issue. If we have the type 1 congestion, it is very will boost the adapter routing and congestion control are activated. The adapter routing will shift flow to another like loaded passed. Meanwhile, the congest control may set the ECM bit a if it is busy execution, safe, easy to reduce the flow rate. As a result, this flow will run on a light loaded path with the low rate. At least for a while. This definitely reduced in effective natural banners. Right? Another case, this time is type 2 congestion. For the type 2 congestion, the only way to mitigate is to reduce the sending rate. That means to perform the congestion control. Any additional adapt to routing on this flow, will not will not only fail to mitigate congestion, but also introduced the unnecessary out of all the traffic. So the uncoordinated adapter routing and congest control me, a deteriorated systems performance. Please, next"

    "text": "so here's our proposal. The basic idea is to distinct traffic and non cc traffic and treat them differently while the congestion can happens, a CC traffic in the, that that refers to the package in the flows, which cause type 2 congestion. And now CC traffic, means the traffic, which caused type 1 asked you. For CC traffic, we just perform the congest control, and do perform adapter routing. But for non CC traffic, we first considered to perform that routing. Only if that routing are not available, then we change to perform the congested control. Next slide. I'd like to give you some totally illustrate how the scheme works. But before that, let me explain 2 important components in this scheme. First is a tag, the coordination tag that is inserted into data package. It has two parts, c's indicator and AI indicator. C's indicator indicates if the packet blocks to flow, which needs congestion control, the default value is 0. The AR indicator, it indicates the location of upstream point where the where adaptive routing can be performed. Usually, the switch just check the local passes to see if there's any available paths to shift the flow. Sometimes, it is possible that it cannot find available local passes but there is upstream point. It could be a switch or could be host. That point can find another path for this flow to bypass this rate, switch the air indicator just points to the location. Next slide, Another component is the notification search, there are several types, the CC notification, and CC release notification, they are used to set or unset the c's indicator at the source side It is sent from the congestion point to the source host, when the type 2 congestion is detected. Like, for example, if it is the congestion happens on the last hop. And on the egress port, this is detected as"

The Upstream another type is the Upstream AI notification, This is used to, notify upstream points to perform a depth of routing Please go to next slide. Let me give you example perhaps that helps to explain the scheme. This is the 4 layered, fat treat apology, you can see that's the layer 1, the layer 2 switches, and together with the host allocated in the computing racks, layer 3 and layer 4 switches, in the switching racks. That's point 1 in this figure on the host to send a packet, send a package. It says this, CC indicator the data packet to be 0. That means this is non usage traffic. When this packet arrives at the error ones which this is point 2 in this figure the air one checks, there is, amount that there are multiple passes for for forwarding this packet, it's just the chooses one of them. According to its own strategy and updates the are indicator to be a 1. That means I am capable to perform adaptive routing. Then at point 3 in this figure the same situation, the air 2 updates in AR indicator, air s air 2 at point 4, congestion happens there because this is in network congestion and this is indicator of the data packet is 0. So Air Force decides to perform a deploy routing. Unfortunately, cannot find proper, like, a load in the past. But by reading the AI indicator in the data package, it knows upstream point, air 2 can perform the adapter routing. So it generates a AR notification and sends it back to air 2. After receiving this AR notification that is at 0.5 the air 2,"

It's shown by this line, in this figure, and you can see the red line just to bypass the congestion points. At point point 6, there is incast congestion. So assisting notification is sent to the host. So finally, at point 7, the host up and set the cease indicator of the subsequent parties of this flow to be 1. So those packets will not not be performed at the routing when they traverse the network. Well, well, my last start site, this next step. So I I've already uploaded the the draft. I encourage the the remaining list and welcome your contributions, decks, before we take a question, couple of comments to your presentation, so you'll assume there are flows in in most adaptive routing solutions. There are no flows at packets. You assume there are flows. There are actually no flows. They're flows? No. Therant, 7. We discussed another time. Sorry. 2nd feedback is that Whether you can load balance traffic or not, it's often depends on HDMA semantics. Or demoperations. Next weekend. Yeah.

Yes, there are different mechanisms for congestion control and, I think in in independent, it also has the different strategies, but I think here the the the The key point is we need to coordinate the gap routing and can just control. It does not we do not intend to, invent some new schemes for the congested control, if the routing just to see if they can work together. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Then the number, I should following the similar question, earlier. They they they there's ECN, like, I see 6040, being already documented on the congestion control. Would you be able to analyze that and see if that approach can de applied to your work. Ecian, Ecian is not it it just has one way to use Lincoln control right now. Right? So we could reuse the ECN we actually here is the coordination between your data routing and can just control can still use the one bit PCN, like, DCQC and use that. We can still use that mechanism for congestive control, but we just need to say where we need to trigger the congestion control or when we we need to perform adaptive routing, but You can still use the ECN.
