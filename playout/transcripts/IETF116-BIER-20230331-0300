Now beer, it did not consider any cost initially. So we... These two drops cover the the beer with any cost. In this That's like I have a picture showing that we have p zeros through p three. Where see is multi home to p y p two, and the p p to share any cost address one. And then c two is multi p two and p three, who also share any cost address too. And then c three just single homes.

In this situation that we want to address. Each B r prefix will have its own P r id allowing this multiple beer prefixes is to so that we can have different module homing protection groups in the in the picture in previous slide, p two can have two any cost addresses that associated with it and as a peer prefix. So if B I, ingress be a beer router It has any cost beer prefixes, then or when it sends traffic, it needs to use the appropriate f id. We has multiple those P priorities. Of course, we would want to minimize number of beer P prefixes, because that we can... That way, we can reduce the number of bits that we that are needed.

So to make use of any cost based egress protection, all the P in the domain must support this feature. The air analog message from Legacy P will help identify the situation. I normally up on the operator deploy this feature, it will make sure that they should make sure that other the routers can support the feature. But if somehow they missed it, and then and there is legacy router in the network then lot messi well will help identify that situation. We thought about signaling a B capability supporting the any cost. We... The conclusion was that it doesn't really help. And it is not needed anyway. And the error log messages we'll have I for the situation. So we just decided to go with the simple solution that's just make sure other B support this feature.

Right? So I think either of them can be any cars and it's it's unclear which of the things you're talking about related to an any source on any cast receiver bit.

When you need to make sure that's when you send traffic you want to re... Use the appropriate B Id in the package. So and then in the case of having the same bit So to speak assigned to multiple receivers, you would also like the normal any cost that whatever is the shorter path from a particular rather than the distribution trees the only one that should get the traffic.

So it happens three recur on every hop of course. If you don't know for every year but on a single hop, it's just the first field that you need the length Because after that there is indication of the recur. Yes. And I don't think you should be able to to decode the whole bloody tree that's encoded with five or six hops down, in the same way that you're not supposed to be able to decode, you know, a stack of protocol and encapsulation that you don't care about processing. So that's that's the argument for not being fully place it in the packet but only explicit to the degree that you need to process in the forwarding plane. No. Antonio to answer your question. So it needs a length field you know what to be for is? And I need to do for all of them. But also whether there's a request encoding, that information is also not in the packet that is in the router. So if the router receives a back, it hasn't a recur glitch set. And then you know that need to look that's also not in the package. Stuff would have the the the length field. Right? So which... It's perfectly fine. It's just I think it's too much overhead. Then you could decode the whole tree cause on every recurring step you have the same Correct. Yes. Yeah. Now just be... So just because you think it's too much over it doesn't mean you need to discard it, Right? You need to build a protocol, which is reliable and can be troubleshoot. Yeah. But write down. And if that fails that's the auto wanted to then we're going back to the the length fields. Exactly. Andrew speaking is Me? Just without going into too much detail. For me, it is critical that you can decode a packet outside of just the forwarding plane because we use that functionality for a whole bunch of things. Everything from, you know,"

And so that is a very, very important thing for pretty much any operator that we are able to do that. No. No. Completely agreed. I would just say that not all of that has to be solid in the forwarding plane. So for example, anybody that starts to work with anything encrypted also needs to be share of of of keys to be able to continue to decrypt so that's part of a control plane. In the same way, if you wanna have semantic decoding of anything that N mp does, you need to have knowledge from the control plane. So if you want is spoof... If you wanna do diagnostics, it needs to be control plane and forwarding plane that you have access to. Not in entirely. If I look at for example, on the encrypted stuff. Okay. They're about to change the s I encrypted it. But I don't you know, I can get to a certain level. Yeah. When it comes to Mp, if I'm doing packet accounting, I know with the bottom last jacket. Of course. And I know where read the next. Header a lot of it. And from there, I go my what's the same. Yeah. I don't need to know the full semantics but I can still... You you know Yeah.

So we're we're discussing about looking deeper into the Rb header itself. There are... I mean, I'll tricks we can play since this will be a completely new interpreter station of the beer mask on a sub domain that, you know, can do crazy stuff. For example after the beer header at the length information that you capture, if you need to do the decode the stuff and normally you're don't process in the forwarding plan because you already have it.

And not that we as vendors may be interested, but I really like to have you know an open source reference implementation. So researchers can start deploying and and playing around with this building application the same way they can do it with the P four implementation with with Beer now with that implementation, and we already saw that for example, the Beijing university was porting the b work to Ip six they could experiment with Msr. So I think four four research this is quite important. And then next slide final slide? So as to the Apis, we should probably hook up with death net jamal and those guys. Right? Yeah.

No that's that's yet another thing and and even explaining what are the occasions in a data center you can do right, You told me what kind of the pull vacations are where service providers really want to deploy, but I think there are a lot of push applications so you need to tell the people you could use beer and B and this stuff to do better than multi us and somehow we need to start making progress on that. So, yeah, this this was kind of a working slide for all the different alternatives that we've been looking into the so that's university did on analysis starting with B, which is simple. So...

And if you look at the current technologies, Beer or Rb, mentioned a couple of stations back. And then look at the Ai training disease and look at the the chat Gp, Within four months the parameter increased from one point five billion to One hundred seventy five billion about hundred times increase. So the things like this is something related also to accessibility. Say, More even if you try to change your child, I'm now sure up again cover year. This is something more related to the Easy specific the work. Reliability, scalability, dynamics and also extended. Thank you. Thank you. Fact. From my point of view, it Yeah. it's really only such as how to duplicate or how to passed. We need a site of a solution because it... The network is very in with the data processing precisely So... Yeah. Okay. But, I mean, it would be a productive path. If you ask us why you hear and what you want to get done. Okay? If your conclusion is nothing to be done here, then please, we have tied agendas don't waste over time. Okay, Mana. Yeah. Montgomery cisco systems. So I think if I see in that overall discussion we use chad of times. First time when I heard this use case, charge Gp was not even born. So I would go back that original use case really his before you inject Gp. Mh. Three use cases which you have spoken two out of them. I really don't understand how you have hundred thousand receivers. So if you saying that there is some data which needs to go and get stored at multiple places. Will we really store it ten hundred thousand data centers?"

    "text": "Which I really don't. No. No. The point is more than out of this hundred thousand each time they have a workload to just pick ten. Oh, the ten hours is different. And that's the problem. Right? They have basically very short lived flow to always change small set of receivers. So I think there is no dynamic protocol can convergent dispute. Right? It's simply you can distribute the state fast enough and the joints and whatever. So you end up on an inclusive p. Right? But now they also want the selective p. Now guess what, the only technologies is right there that can do that, plus by direction it's beer. Know, but maybe there's some magic to be had by, you know, enough pixie dust or something. Okay? Yeah. Andrew? Yeah. So I wanted to comment a little bit on this wearing my Ad hat having been involved in civil of the discussion The way that I see this is that there is clearly a requirement here. There is also as stated by yourself a requirement that requires something to happen fairly fast. Now we're in the Etf. Things take a while here just just a little while, you know I would like to see. For from my side, but again completely up to the working group. That we explore whether or not we can make this work Within the con conform of this working group, because number one, it's gonna speed up the development. Right? Gonna speed up getting you guys to where you wanna go. Number two, it prevents a further duplication of work where there is already gonna a lot going on within the And There's always a place for new work. Within the."

And if we have something here, that could work From my perspective and again, I'm not gonna dictate to the working group. I think that exploring this within this forum would be a worthwhile thing to do. And I'm quite prepared as the Ad if we need to make modifications to the charter to enable that exploration I'm quite prepared to work with it. But what I would like to see is some way forward because we've kind of had this back and forth and back and forth now, for quite a while. And I'm quite happy to see that there's a good use case being presented here. What I'm hearing from tony and I'm quite happy to hear from the rest of the working group is there may be a way to make this work. But like to get the chance if they are saying that. And see where we go from there. That's that's my viewpoint. Yeah. Sent you, Andrew. So I would like to to provide us some my consideration Firstly, I think you know, it has network. It's really different Applicant scenario. And those requirements, the the the experts for that. Maybe it's a totally different So If I may, let me just comment on that as well. Yep. And I think this came up in another meeting that we had recently Yeah. That I think that there was an multi cost portion to this. There was also a data center portion to this. Yeah. The data center portion and data center networking in general. Is something that"

We haven't gotten there yet, but it's something that as I said in that meeting, I would look at but I don't think that that is a blocker because remember that's gonna take time. Yeah. You know, That is not and half divorced. I don't think that that is necessarily a blocker to exploring whether or not the multi cost requirements can be achieved within the con of what already exists. Is in everybody's advantage to do. Yeah. Yeah. And the second point is is Adam. You know, if we start the work based on the some existing our legacy work, maybe it's more harder to developer a new solution as quicker as we want. So when yep. When this group was one of the fastest moving it charter in. It took eight years. To get multi vendor silicone deployed. Now, if you say I care squad for consensus, and I build my own proprietary solution somewhere, and I don't show it I show the information. Look how great the thing was all power to you, you will move faster. When you go into the it of processes and you build consensus, those are the realities to get the stuff out there. So, you know, pick your choice, you can have both. Just just sheer grown up reality talk. Right? Every eight years? Now we have about three or four silicon implementation deployment. Was a really, really fast group. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Homer, please. Yeah. You're kind of still"

    "text": "thunder from me. Yeah. A couple of points. You mentioned that when it comes to multi cast states, they're they're, like a trees you don't not wanna have multi multitasking states in the data center because you have one too many that doing multitasking Okay. It would be nice to put example of the thousands of applications. So currently, anything any tree that has a multi kansas stay within the network. Can go up to ten thousand twenty thousand sixty thousand, whatever. Right? That's the number of it states we can have even an N mp world. So, you know, what goes beyond that, it would be nice something in there. The the second thing is that what about cross data centers, like is there a need to have this multi multitask to go beyond the current data center go in the inter data center link, which is usually over like, Max or whatever. A protected and go to the next data of center because there is some compute over there that they need to do the same type of computing the first data center. So that's the next thing you need to think about. And and last but not least I completely agree with Tony mean, if you're looking for something quick the technology right now is Mp Ip, which you said point multi to point rs you know, as our policy, to remove the protocol but this gonna create a states team if you do not wanna states, then it's a bigger type of technology, which we are coming up with the silicon, But if you're going beyond this, that there's nothing out there from Like, even b is great, but the problem that we have we're having right now is there not you enough, silicon out there, to deploy it all over the network. So all these stuff given together. You know? Yes. That that is also my concern. So if we want to base such as a beer to do that. You know in fact"

Because we have a so large number of existing network. So if you want to deploy zeus solution in the large last night work it. You will take a very higher cost. Why we here pointer of the objective? That data send her is a new model. If you build this data, you don't existing technology. You can deploy the new solution. Yeah. So I'm I'm I'm not trying to solve that problem. New technology grade but that the the underneath technology will remain the same. Right? I mean, what I'm trying to say is that if you want have source multi multitask routing. Solution is beer. Yes. If you want to have some kind of a tree that is Ip mp, solution is you know, a three seat or point to multi point r, you can call it whatever you wanna call it, new data center protocol. Whatever is said you wanna call it, but that's gonna be what the silicon can support. If you wanna come up with the brand new silicon, I can guarantee you that you're gonna be standing there for next ten years. Trying to come up with a new way of doing it. That's working for for the cast verse because you know we we want a new technology but not tomorrow. Yeah. You know, we we need some window to weed for its riley. In a... But if we have some legacy"

Because you're data center, Okay. Just you will be competing with optical cost. Yeah. That's is possible too. I just remind you. Yeah. Alright. So in the famous world words of eric grows Your problem may be over constrained. And then he used to hang up. Okay. I think we're done for the day. Thanks for the great session. Ceo ian San Francisco next time. Okay. So notes have been taken. I hope. Mana. Thank you very much. Just tell one the thing. I think this discussion we've been having in here I think Let's continue it on the mailing list as well. But if we do, let it be in the context of the use cases. As it has been here. I think that the use case have been shown. Right? And how beer is sub suboptimal demand for the stuff and that's the only really hard thing I and put my teeth in and frankly, I'm willing to go and give time on the mailing and more in this working group for because otherwise, we know we have shit lot of drops to do. Right? And real problems to solve to actually get the technology out there on the white scale. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yep. Thing going Yes. Yes. I have to one. Is the guy who didn't write this stuff"
