    "text": "cellular equipment is really hard to use and this is actually I think the most exciting one and sort of brought me into this room to talk about this is that you know LTE isn\u0027t designed for the little guys right yeah everyone in here can run a Wi-Fi hotspot but you can\u0027t do that with LT necessarily this is shifting right now one data point is the Wireless ISP model in the u.s. there are hundreds of wireless ISPs in rural America running LTE equipment they do that they hand you the radio receiver and it has a sim card built in and you just have access in the wide area so this is already happening so sort of hacker ish folks are running these networks at scale in the US a second thing that\u0027s happening is private LTE and this is all IOT buzz but it\u0027s actually getting built so these are let\u0027s say you own a factory and you want to do do IOT in your factory well what you can do is install a small cell phone network just in your building against smaller and smaller organizations participating in building out this kind of networks lastly carrier aggregation is I think the most exciting thing this is going to be a huge element of the middle term future and into new radio what it is is in buildings like this the owner can install LTE in the building and what they\u0027ll do is they\u0027ll loan that out to the carriers the VMO knows and charge a little bit of overhead on that so basically every office building every residential metropolis building is going to have building owned network in it and for that to be a community network is not significantly different than what it is now you just pointed at a different carrier aggregator okay so this is kind of the point I think this is a great opportunity right now just start to build out community LTE in cities so I went too fast so what\u0027s the plan what are we doing what is it what is what are my students actually building it\u0027s it\u0027s largely this right so our technology agenda is the thing we\u0027re calling federated LTE and the big idea is we\u0027re using distributed ledger as the backend to store a whole bunch of the core network required people know amber we\u0027ve sort of hedged our bets on doing amber esque stuff by thinking LTE is the better access medium for all the reasons I\u0027ve given earlier the big idea here is make it so that anybody can join this Federation let you stand up a new LTE network you pointed at the right thing you join the Federation all the sim cards work all the roaming works all that kind of stuff and instead of just doing the billing as the Federated element which is what amber did before we\u0027re gonna try to do everything else you saw authentication and mobility and spectrum coordination similarly in the sky in a way that everybody can peer together in a distributed decentralized fashion so this isn\u0027t a hugely technical talk so I\u0027m gonna hand away of all of that but we are building things and we\u0027re deploying things and so this is our planned deployment here in the fall in Seattle so we have access to two rooftops from the University of Washington one is Harborview Medical and the other one is 45 45 in in the U district and so that\u0027s the northern one here and this other one here we\u0027re gonna put two networks up have them fed right together and build a small-scale federated LTE network in Seattle I think "

    "text": "it\u0027ll be the first community cellular installation in a city that I know of a key point here and kind of one of the reasons to be here is that as a nature of a federated network anyone here is welcome to join and we\u0027d be happy to point you on how to do this kind of stuff you stand it up and we\u0027ll send you some SIM cards and you can roam onto our network and we can roam on to yours and hopefully everybody\u0027s friendly and happy all right thanks excellent any questions for Curtis we have about two minutes this is Geoffrey Gaston hi yes the yes or no fee yeah so the way that it works technically is that your radio will connect to whatever the core network is somewhere right and that\u0027s the organization you\u0027re talking about that has some sort of privacy guarantees and so even in the roaming network in like you\u0027re a carrier aggregation side of a building if you\u0027re an AT\u0026T customer they\u0027ll build a pipe for you to go to AT\u0026T and then your your data is all sensibly private at least the AT\u0026T now in our system we\u0027re actually removing a whole bunch of this for a bunch of technical reasons users are saying we should be doing with the internet doesn\u0027t do end and privacy on basically everything it\u0027s only handling IP traffic if you\u0027re sending me unencrypted things over that it\u0027s not going to help you or it\u0027s not gonna it\u0027s not gonna be a good idea but yeah sure so traditionally backhaul limitations have been a huge deal in rural access specifically royalty our network and Bob who has a three megabit per second backhaul our front-hall connection on that thing like that for knows the wrong word but the connection to the user isn\u0027t like a hundred megabits and so it\u0027s just the mismatch there\u0027s a huge deal the nice thing about what we\u0027re doing here is the City of Seattle in particular has fiber all over the place so we\u0027re just plugging into that we\u0027re gonna be good to go so in general the answer is like approximately 100 megabits slightly more than that but it depends on the use an individual handset I think can handle like 20 megabits per second normally and then you\u0027re gonna spread out your hundred megabits over whatever but so that\u0027s probably about the right answer these are great questions I don\u0027t know off the top of my head yeah it depends on what our open source partners currently support which almost certainly means ipv4 only this is Dino list in the private LT building case yeah is that at the point where you use it instead of Wi-Fi or in addition to its it\u0027s mostly so in addition is the sort of reality facing version of it right so if you have an apartment building people are going to put in their own their own their own Wi-Fi but what they want to do is have like people coming into the building have to sell over the whole way "
