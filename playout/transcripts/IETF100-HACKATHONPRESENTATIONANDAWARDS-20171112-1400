    "text": "the working across teams that\u0027s one of the things I love about this hackathon it\u0027s great about the ITF in general and I think that spirit carries over to this where you see teams helping each other out and that\u0027s kind of a tricky thing with the prizes we actually got some pretty good prizes here so we we see that all of you work really hard regardless it\u0027s not a hard thing to get people here motivated we like the prizes to be something nice for you to take away but we certainly don\u0027t want to lose that collaborative spirit because that\u0027s one of the most important things here and welcoming new members in and taking time to bring them up to speed those are all things we really really like to see we\u0027ve added some new fields to the registration where we ask you a bit more information like is this your first IETF are you staying for the IETF meeting or are you just here for the hackathon we\u0027re kind of continuing to evolve that I hope you don\u0027t find it too overbearing that we\u0027re asking too many questions but having those metrics is actually really not so that\u0027s the reason we\u0027re asking them because one of the goals is to bring new people into the IETF and so we like to see hey is this helping with that and it just helps for for planning as well anyone else have anything they want to say I\u0027m kind of running out of yeah okay yeah maybe that\u0027s um let\u0027s uh help me to take a look at that afterwards and so the the suggestion was that that there is some like some open-source tools that are provided out there and mechanisms that were you can create presentations and upload them and people can share them and if it\u0027s something that because one of the things we like to do is I don\u0027t know who all is going to be presenting ahead of time we we have like 200 people here actually we this was a record I think if if you look at the registration list or like two hundred and twenty or something crazy like that so the problem is any of you might want to upload something and most things it\u0027s like we have to invite you or pre-configure you perhaps as a hackathon project someone wants to write something that takes the list of registered you know registered attendees and gets them authenticated in the data tracker or something but the the proposal here was maybe we could look at this this tool which is actually a little bit better for creating and sharing presentations and as long as it lets anyone you know put stuff there and lets all of us see it that\u0027s that\u0027s the key if we can do that that would be "
