Please feel free to grab your lunches, and please don't forget to take your lunches and your garbage with you and you leave. This is an official, IATF meeting. This is a note well and all of you have agreed to participate by it. Our general admin notes for this meeting are, We will be doing draft minutes, in the online notes tool.

I chair the HTV group, and I am also, the What do you call it? Lead? Person who is stuck with things for the HTTP director. What is it, Franchesca? Secretariat. Sure. Secretariat. So I would not dream of of ever implying that your authors and your editors and your working groups are not completely across applications and protocols. We understand to be the internet now. But Once in a while, There are nuances that maybe don't quite get through. And so recently, we established, the HTTP directorate to help review documents that use HTTP. In their protocols. And that's because we're finding a lot of working groups are now using HTTP as a what is sometimes called substrate protocol. So instead of building their own new to call directly on IP or TCP or, know, you quick these days. They'll reuse HTTP. And there are certain things that that can cause issues in that. And so we have the directorate. It's very easy to find information about us. If you go to"

Sometimes there's some aspects of that that aren't obvious. Highlight ways that you can get more value out of using HTTP in your proposal work with the authors to make sure that best practices are followed. And verify that it doesn't actually harm the HTTP ecosystem unintentionally. And and so there's some advice there of how you can engage with us. You know, to be very clear, because this sometimes is happens in, in some communities. We're not here to be religious about or anything like that. We just wanna get you to make sure that you're aligned with the protocol and and getting value out of it. And and so, we point you to things like bcp56, we have an editorial style guide style guide for how to refer to the protocol and and some other recommendations. Please be aware of this. If you have drafts that are using HTTP We encourage early reviews. That's a lot easier to incorporate advice very early in the process. We're watching the the the the 00 drafts as they go by to see if they're using HTTP we might miss it. So if you have a draft that is using HTV, please engage with us. And we'll be very happy to give feedback and and guidance and and and talk to your authors. That's all I've got. Any questions? Hi, Mark. Yeah. One quick question. Is it possible to request, is the director tied into the data tracker yet, you know? Oh, very much so. Yes. Jump.

There is some loose self management or working group chairs. This forum effect is it, you know, and there is the working group chair's mailing list for helping each other.

And part 3 is stuff that is simply being discussed and no decisions or anything's made about at all. So the skills development framework, the the problems that we have, and we know if this is from, interviews, informal conversation, posting to working group chairs and things is the the that the knowledge and skills is uneven across the sex, across the cohort. Of working group chairs. There is, we don't we we don't have a baseline understanding of responsibilities and standard practices. We, you know, we can't say for certain everybody knows this baseline. You know, in that way. And that there are working group chairs are often left in the, you know, unenviable was position of discovering on their own, what tasks they need to do, how to complete them, and, sometimes creating their own tools and information to do this because they're not aware that there are already other resources that do that. And then there are, different practices across working groups. Now some people describe this as a problem, but it has different experiences for working group participants and and extreme cases, practices that may not meet requirements, others actually think that this is a can be a benefit. You know, it's the that we have different practices. Okay. So next slide, please.

So part 2, and this is under active consideration. Okay? This is, the, the general thing is here is about informed decision making. The ISG has very little data on working group chairs. And that's hampering multiple things, related to planning. The the the the the work that the ISG do ISG has to do with chairs sometimes can be, a very large level of work. And if there's better data that is able to help plan that, then that's, to an advantage. So at the individual working group chair level, ISG doesn't know key data, such as how working group participants rate chair, for example, you know, one of those things, how do the chairs rate themselves, at what support their chairs think they need. That sort stuff. Now, ADs received direct feedback where there's a problem, and sometimes direct feedback when things are going well. But better data would just help with this. It, you know, rather than sometimes things a crisis. If data is there, then you can, plan for things much better. And then at the cohort level, there's a lot the IESG doesn't know. Basic demographic breakdown. We don't know gender breakdown of chairs. For example, we don't age breakdown. We don't know all sorts of things. We don't know role data such as the turnover rate. And, as Lesley asked, you know, some of our data about how long people have been chairs is is a little bit dubious as well.

So part 3, this is entirely under discussion. No decisions. No know, this is simply just things that are being talked about and thought about. And in the general area of sharing opportunities. So, you know, AD's report that there is a general paucity of candidates for a chair role when a new chair role comes up. And this can make finding a a replacement working group chair a difficult and stressful process particularly if it needs to be done quickly. It requires considerable effort by area directors, both to encourage candidates and to assess candidate suitability. Forcibly removing a longstanding working group share, is a is a big issue. You know, it creates personal rank or significant reaction from those in the community. It's a big thing. It's a very, very big thing.

For which I'm not going to be working group chair. Talking to people, There is an expectation that you're only gonna get one novice. I don't think that that's healthy.

But working to the data and the, survey that has been going around, and I'll be talking a little bit about one of the observations with that later. The length of the chair is also roughly corresponds with the length of the life of the working groups. You know, so you're getting especially for long lived working groups.

But, that's saying they're usually at the working group meetings. So for physical meetings, that may be maybe practical, but the chairs need perhaps a more continuing source of advice. So I would just to thought, size that our technical advisors pointed to somewhere in groups. Maybe there should be a process adviser. Could be appointed for a working group to, unburdened the AD from the scheme of questions from novice or in group chairs. Thank you. Yeah. Jonathan Monnex, I just had a question. You mentioned that you opened up the chairs training to non chairs. I'm if you know how many non chairs actually came to that and if there've been any I'm looking at my colleague who's got a mouthful of food. Yeah. Greg Woody. And, again, as Pete mentioned, the numbers were pretty low overall on fortunate. But and my we haven't broken out the specific chair and non chair we can do. Okay. Did you want your last two slides? Do I have 2 more slots? Yeah. You do. yeah. Yeah. That's happening. Oh, right. Nothing's The next one was a thank you. Well, you can stay right there because you're next. Okay. So now I'm gonna be talking about the IHF Community Survey. If you think that last presentation was fast and for it, no. So we have the draft report out about the IETF Community Survey. Next slide, please. Presentation here cannot replace the, reading the report. This is just to give you an of some of the things that are in there so that you may feel motivated to, either read it or comment on it or try to steer the direction of what it says. It's intentionally a draft report because it makes a number of, key findings based on the data."

So this is the 3rd annual survey. 3 goals, size and demographic breakdown of the IETF community, data to inform the IETF community and those leadership roles, no about, what are the issues and possibly what are not issues. And then a, a time series of data that can be used to assess the natural changes affecting the IATF and the effectiveness of any change programs and things going on. Next slide, please. It so this one ran from December to January. Is usually it is sent directly to every email address subscribed to an IETF mailing list. Unless they've opted out of a previous survey. Which only a few 100 have. And so it goes to 49,000 working email address. And gets back about 2000 response it goes through a data cleaning bits. There are there are people who bots who answer their, you know, people who deliberately just say yes to everything. And so will you have to go through a cleaning exercise? 1812 used. And so that's a marginal error of plusor-2.26percent Next slide, please. So, some demographics there are a lot more chance about the demographics in the report next slide, please. So we start off this survey in a new way by asking people to choose one of these categories for themselves. They are, you know, a regular participant and occasional participant, they are just a reader lirker, you know, read but never post. There's somebody who monitors meshing subjects and occasionally reads, but never posts. And ex participant, new participants, which obviously is a relatively loose thing and non participants. Anybody who answers a non participant is then said, thank you very much and doesn't in the rest of the survey, which is another reason why we have,"

People can only choose one region, and this is the breakdown of it by participant type and normalized by that participant type. So, what we can see as I think we all expect is that Europe and North America dominate there, both of them on approximately 40%. This tallies well with what we see, from post meeting surveys and Asia on 11a half percent fleet, flee, flee, flee, flee, flee, flee If we look at, regular participants. We have a slight shift there with, fewer from your and more from North America. And if we look at new participants, we have a distinct shift there where we have many more coming from Europe and more from Asia, much fewer. From North America. So it's just giving us an idea possibly of of changing regional demographics. I'll talk more about regions like the other regions a little bit later on. Next slide, please. Age. So we have you know, a textbook normal distribution here of age, showing people, slightly younger than me in the majority in the middle of the thing, I believe. Again, if we look at the the regular column there, the regular participant column, see a very similar distribution. If we look over at the new participant column, I mean, it's not surprising, really. Younger people are joining on average much more. So which is a, a clear indication of the way things are going in the future, I think. Next slide, please. If we look at gender, now gender is asked differently from these other questions. Gender allow the question allows people to check all that apply. Of those choices, man, woman, non binary transgender, another."

Next slide, please. And then these are new some new questions that we're get a little bit more at. So we're asking people what's your employment status and also asking them to check all that apply. So, I I'm not gonna explain the 3 different columns at the top, but these are different ways of measuring this so that it gives you a different idea. So we can see that most people that come are employees vendorindependent contractors, business owners, retired and students, you know, have a relatively clear, spread there. And if you look again at new many more students. As we can see, over there. And, far fewer independent contractors as well, which is, an interesting point. Next slide, please. So we then add on top of the, employment to ask separate question, what sectors do you work in? And we have these ones here, business academia, civil society are not for profit government, and none of the above, we have a efficiently large none of the above, and I need to next time we do this, try to explore a bit more I think so next slide. So that now gives us This lovely chart. So, this is the employment type of employment by the sector. So, for those of you who can see the colors, The dark blue ones are all business. The big box on the left are all employees. So we can see how employees split up"

So now we're gonna go into some key findings. And these are the bits really where as much feedback as possible is very helpful. And this is in a bridge version that misses some of the nuances. Next slide, please. So The, the first statement here Key finding is that the IETF is good at delivering its mission and principles, but could do much better. So if we look at, The IETF produces high quality RFCs. The middle column is something called a coding mean, where we apply a score from 1 to 5, from the almost never through to almost always, and take the mean of that. Anything over 4 is, good. And so that's, those are the whole commerces GoodRx. And those are good schools. Anyway, very good schools for high quality RFCs, open and transparent manner reflect consensus relevant RSCs. Those are all great scores. Okay? If we look down at the bottom though about the timely manner, post score, and that is repeated throughout the the the entire, survey is timing assist. The other one and there's another big thing that goes throughout, which is about processes. And about people's views on what's important and what isn't important. You. Next slide please. And the IETF has considered a very important organization that outperforms its peers in all respects. This is astonishing, right? So first of all, how important is it? We do a Net Promoter Score. Mechanism, it's a so you give it a scale of 1 to 10. If you select 9 or 10, then you are a promoter. If you select can't remember 1, 2, or 3 or something. You're a detractor and everything else is, a in the middle."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:46:01",
    "text": "And so we have a promoter score of 63 and we have a good chapter score of 7. You deduct one from the other. So we're well over 55 there. That's a fantastic net positive, you know, netpromote score. People really think we are extremely important organization. Next slide, please. So we did not ask this question. How well do you think the IETF compares to other standard setting organizations for the following x. If the middle column is above 3, that means the IATF is rated better. Than other organizations. Okay? 3 is the neutral about the same. So as you can see, it rates better on every score. It rates better overall. It's not a lot. Better, better, in some cases, you know, so but little things down the bottom, like behavior of other participants, it fades better, for example. And at the top, the openness of the standards will this process, of course. Now, None of those are very strong scores in terms of rating better. But it's still noticeable that it writes better. Next slide, please. So, with the new question as well, participant participate is driven by personal interest and a specific technology generally, not business or employer goals. So how important are the following reasons for participating? My personal interest, make the Internet work better, keep up to date in my professional development all at the top. Down the bottom, to bring a new business or find a new employer. Is really low and to represent my employer stroke clients. Is fairly low as well. So it it, you know, it's a it is a personally motivated bit. I'm not gonna show you the bit about specific technology, but there is data there that shows that as well, which means that Some people sometimes believe that people come to the because it's a thing they want to come to and they look around trying to find something of interest. The data actually shows they don't do that. Come because there's a specific thing they know about already and then work out the IETF around it. Next slide, please."

I'm treated the same as the rest of the IT community, we see quite a divergence between men and women there. For non binary entrenched lender people, the numbers of people who were replied the absolute number is too low generally for us to put this to be reliable data. K? So next slide, please. Now participation is dominated by people from 2 regions. We saw that in the beginning, North American Europe. And there are multiple factors behind that. Skilling English is one of them. We see a distinct difference about English here. For Asia and Latin America. We have a notable thing about understanding the IETF well enough. And then We have this odd thing about feeling part of the IETF community, which is potentially a not, cause it's a, it's an effect of part of other things. Next slide, please. Now there is a problem behavior, but it is hard to pin down. This is probably almost the only one of the few places that appears. I go back to that question, I asked earlier about how, the IETF compares to other standards setting organizations, we break it down by the type of participant, then regular participants score it lower than other SDOs. Okay? So, which, you know, and they should know best, shouldn't they you know, of the regular participants. So there is a problem there. You're just getting to it is the awkward bit. Alright. Next slide, please. New participants need to learn a lot to be effective. And without that config excluded. So, What hinders you from deterring or participating in the IETF? This is a new question as well. The cost of participating and the complexity of IETF processes. Mirrorized, derived very much"

And, email, by the way, is just a religion. Across everything. We'll get to that in a minute. Alright. Next slide, please. Here we go. Email is still universally preferred. Every single way I try to break down what people think about email, everybody loves it. Honestly, whether it's by age, whether it's by type of participant, whether it is by Gender, whatever. It doesn't matter. People love email. And if you have a look here, by the 18 to 24 year group for email, even their preference is higher than their preference for any of the other ways of participating in the IETF. Okay? It's a To be clear, that doesn't mean they Right? No. This is their preference. Is their preferred way? Yeah. Yeah. That's absolutely true. That is. Yeah. Absolutely. M, So but, I mean, that's a that's a tight cluster there. And what I think this tells us a bit as well if you look at the younger people, They tend to like everything. So what we're gonna see happen is not so much that email is gonna go down, but younger people want to use all of these channels as appropriate for different things. So we're not gonna see one thing replaced with another. We're gonna see, you know, a multiplicity of things. Okay. Yep. Next slide, please. Do you want me to going to the Do you want David and Sorry.

This question is double checked in 3 different questions to understand how people think about this. I'm only showing one of them here. If, you know, Right? Yeah. Yeah. It it does seem to be the way that people just prefer it. It's when I speak to younger people about this, they regard email as a specific tool used for a specific type thing here, and they would never consider it in anything outside of an environment like this, the way that some of us older people might do within that framework are comfortable with it. But I'm I'm not I'm generalizing a little bit there, but it does seem to be not confirmation bias. Yep. Thank you. Ron. If everybody can be pretty quick, we're short on time. Happy hour with the percentage of people answering this survey. I'm I'm wondering We're very open to participation. It's very easy to participate in the IACF. It feels like maybe a gatekeeping that is you must answer this survey once per ye/ar especially in the IETF at all, even if the answer is just to go into it and say, I'm still involved in the IOTF. I don't want to answer this. Okay. I'll pass it on to the ISG. I'm not gonna go anywhere near that decision. Thank you. Hoffman, making I'm totally surprised by the 4th line remote at night at an IETF meeting That's a tight cluster. It's way higher than I would have expected.

We have people that want to actually get involved with IETF to advance, you know, things they're doing. So myself and a few other of the, I tip participants make it a habit of actually sort of providing ITF101 type experiences. And, some of our findings for interacting with people trying to onboard them overlaps a couple of interesting points that we've seen out of the survey and some of the recent stuff. First one being that, we just announced that we're decommissioning the Dowify ETF. So It's gotten stale. The stuff that's in the document is all worth reading. Ever read the why the Dow is going away. It's actually a useful thing and it actually feeds into the stuff that the survey covers. But the"

And, you know, the the one side, the the one entry point to get the job done was very useful. We have had a huge amount of work done on the website. Thank you to everybody that's actually done that work. You know, I certainly, you know, we could provide better feedback myself. And, believe we've had calls from the owner to actually, you know, spend some time looking at the content and fleshing it out Unfortunately, one of the problems with website, type activities is they're not intended to be single, you know, point of contact for all this stuff. It's a literally a a web of stuff, web pages are subject to that. They're hard to maintain with versus each other. So a lot of criticisms about why the Dow decommissioned is going to sort of as a self fulfilling prophecy happen on the website eventually. Know, this this requires actual maintenance to make sure that we don't do that. Thanks. Lately. So the one that sort of caught my attention is part of the headaches I have with onboard is know what keeps you from, participating the IETF. What's, you know, the hard thing for you and complexity especially by age group was the thing that popped up. And that was the single point that we hit over and over again during our 101s. Not the what's the draft. Here's an email list, yellow, all for your opinions. These are all easy things. It's literally how does the pipeline of IETF work? How do we actually push stuff in one end? And hold your breath for a very long time. A couple of years. Maybe it actually comes out and maybe you get an RC number out of it. You know, like we were seeing in chats, you know, that's one of the things that people find as difficult thing about IETF is how do we actually set expectations. And more importantly, realize that sometimes the processes we've set up one of the things that's an obstacle for people to participate next slide. So You know, that my intention here for standing up in front of you asking for a little time is to talk about the, you know, you know, managing the complexity No. The chairs are one of the key shepherding points"

Now this is one of the things that's challenging about seeding a new chair especially for existing technology, They need to be well versed in it, but they have to have an awful lot of soft HR type skills as part of their job. And quite frankly, and one of the things that we're always uncomfortable talking about, but it's very relevant strong political skills, and this becomes a very relevant thing. We're also the, front point for managing a lot of the friction points in the ITAP process. Now clearly, ISG takes an awful lot of that work for us and, you know, they get the much harder to know things at the end of the pipeline. But, you know, this is the chair's form. So the question to you and maybe a tiny bit of microphone time, if they're me available is what can we do about trying to reduce this complexity? What can we do that trust the pipeline how do we help with onboarding by making it easier to see how IITF actually works. That was it. Okay. Greg? And, when Greg's come, we have, like, 3 minutes. So Yeah. Just a real quick note to say, appreciate this presentation. A lot of the issues that you are really, really important, particularly the one about working group chairs being key touch points particularly for potential or new participants.
