Chris and I know you\u0027re here you would take minutes I don\u0027t see you Chris okay so if Chris doesn\u0027t we don\u0027t see Kristin would probably some help on the minutes may be good but it should be a fairly light agenda you all know the note well this is pretty good this is actually the updated text I made sure I got the updated text in there so if somebody approved of it there are blue sheets passing around please fill them in we like to see what\u0027s going on they gave us a big room so we did yeah a very quick update we got a couple current documents but basically there\u0027s some new documents coming up that we\u0027re going to kick about but the big thing is we have some new milestones from the last working group meeting they did a recharter brian and terry worked on some it actually went much simpler "
