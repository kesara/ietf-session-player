John\u0027s I\u0027m gonna be giving the newcomers presentation my claim to fame in the IETF is probably that I\u0027ve attended more of these memes anybody else this is by ninety-fifth so I\u0027ve been doing it since basically meeting one does anybody recognize that phrase up there and amazed of twisty little passages all alike this is from an old computer text game called Adventure and part of what how that\u0027s related to this is I\u0027m trying to help you work your way through the maze of what the IETF is this meet this presentation is all about trying to give you the tools you need to survive a week at the IETF and then decide you are completely dead at the end of the week and want to come back again this is a slide you\u0027ll be seeing a lot of you don\u0027t have to read it right now but it\u0027s important to understand that for you to understand that when you\u0027re here you are generally making an IETF contribution so things that you say in working groups if you\u0027re saying them in a working group or to someone who is discussing things about the IETF there\u0027s an IETF contribution which means it\u0027s not something you can basically go oh keep it confidential or things like that if you want to have those talks go ahead and take somebody out someplace else out of the working groups areas or often a corner somewhere and have that conversation but be aware unless you if you\u0027re if you\u0027re working with people who you haven\u0027t talked to before this may apply so there\u0027s a bunch of different on the things but go ahead and read this later on it will show up in every meeting in every session you go to this is not the history the IETF there\u0027s 30-some years of that going on this is not how to write a standard there are for that this is basically how did you survive this week and you know this is what I looked like during several of the IETF meetings way back when we had the longest working group session ever it started about 8:30 8:30 or 9:00 in the morning ran until 2 o\u0027clock the next morning we sent out for pizza twice so pace yourselves through this this is a busy busy week and you can overextend yourself especially if this is your first time trying to do everything the IETF by the way is not like is not a conference in where it\u0027s it\u0027s designed "
