My idea of culture, Alex, say next to me, and I, myself, Hank, will be your coaches for here today. This session is every session. The IETF is recorded. Let's see if my own click Wow. So you all know, they might know the note well. The note well is about what you say here, please take care of their IPR implications. So as somebody recorded, but also makes public and ownership might be a problem. So whatever you say here, take care. That you know you are IP R rules. There's also something. Oh, there's no no value. There's also something to know very well here. And that is, be nice to each other. We chairs sitting in front of you, like teachers in school, sometimes we can't see what happens in the last oral of the classroom. So if you feel comfortable here at the IITF. That is a problem if it is a human problem. So please come forward personally to the chairs. There are people here that are the eighties here.

There, we inherited an item from, Eric here, Carson is talking about that the link was removed because I think just a few hours ago, maybe a day ago, the secretary actually updated the document link So that's outdated and not here in the agenda anymore. We have, from John, the protocol comparison. Document updates, and, Alex, yes, on the comments. And I I promised. I swear I just updated the PDF, but that's not the version. Yes.

Because, Most RFCs in our space. Referencing 7228. Which is the terminology for constrained node networks. And, yeah, this document was written 10 years ago, so it's kind of time to, look at it again. So, this is instead of, authors and one of the co authors in the room and I don't know who how many are online. So, basically, this was a work item of the Working group, Eric, was one of the first IoT oriented recognize we had in the AGF after 6 little pen, And the idea in Eric was to write informational documents that help people implement constrained node networks. And, there were quite a few nice documents coming out of that 2021, we got, document about to subpoena. IOG is easy."

So 7 to 3, this already was some time in the works and, a weak working group, a little bit slow down at the end by a weak getting, slowed down. 7 to 2 the original 7 to 28 from 2014 was mostly concerned with giving some some more well defined basis to the term constrained, which we had been using, of course, my my engineering colleagues telling me that they never have designed a system that was not constrained in some way. I mean, This is the point about engineering to live with your constraints. But, yeah, it has, gotten a specific meeting through through this, RFC and the discussion that I appreciated. So, this was mostly providing a linear scale with two points, class 1, class 2, and, class 0, which means that doesn't work on the Internet and, class more. We didn't have a given into that. So 7 to 28, this, does provide more classes because people actually wanted to have names for the more powerful or as we now often say capable uh-uh classes. But it also, defines some new scales.

You can can read the document And, Recently, we added a few more like, software updatability there there are quite a few different levels of updatability you can have. That's, interesting to have. We have energy use strategies, which which are orthogonal to the energy that act that's available. And we have levels of isolation. So how much is the device able to run, different, pieces of code without them as early into free English with each other. Which is, again, different from another scale for for SQL cheating. Which is also something where we can now differentiate different classes. So the whole point here is that it's just faster to to refer to one of these categories then to try to define it each time, you, need it So this document is is pretty well developed at this point.

So, basically, all the changes between 02and04 is to address the early IoT director interview by Ross Hoseley, so we have added text explaining the difference between an authenticated key exchange, like the TLS handshake, and protocols for predicting application data. For example, TLS Ricconayer, we added, paragraphs to introduce the should not underline layers, and we've moved the more specific ad hoc over co op. Of course, subsection to an appendix.

So all that is, based on the IoT directorate review addresses all the comments It's we think at least then some other changes. We added some new references to roll public key, added a reference to the he impact workshop. Rfc IAB document instead of to the, workshop home page. And then then we added the in reference to the this new paper that has content. Likely to be interested for a reader of this dropped. Then some editorial changes. Yep. The the CTLS209. There's no technical changes in CTLS. I think the only thing that has happened the last year is mother verification. Looks to me that CTLS it seems quite stable. Yes. Sound quick.

We have an editor's note in the document. Saying that so CTLS is one of maybe 6 doc, protocols. Analyzed, and it is in the drops version. It seems stable. And then we are also referring to has been discussing the TLS working group whether to, have more compact encodings of, the nisp curves. The lay latest I heard from the the when presented, the comment was that we should adopt that this if somebody wants to, implement, and nobody has really said that they want to implement what has happened is that Thomas shopping in, which is a author of CTLS, said he wanted to be a cool but I have not really heard him to be commit to implement.

Or indeed, some of the underlying implementation technologies that are required to implement the requirements in their baseline security recommendation document. So this should hopefully provide a landing pad for implementors to be able to understand what exactly they need to do in order to meet the requirements that they have put upon them. So the last time we asked, is this draft done? We needed some reviews. Several reviews were offered. Oh, Go ahead. Hello. I may jump into the slide before. Yeah.

I suppose the other concern that I have, to, to follow on with that, Michael, is that what we currently have is a draft that references 2 European standards. And 1 US standard. And, if we add in yet another bit of European legislation. Then there's a real concern that this is going to appear to only be relevant to to European Implementors. Well, That's a concern, I guess, from a balance point of view. But on the other hand, other jurisdictions, could, Don't have documents. That not. There is Right?

At least there's a mapping of other things. So Are we relying on that mapping to be accurate and correct and that we're looking at the other the other control or requirement frameworks from different countries through the lens of this says it's equivalent x in this land is equivalent to y in in this land, and that's fine. Or you actually took the time to read them separately. Because there's, catch 22 in all of this that gets messy, which is why you're like, a tells me you're you are super excited for this really annoying question. So so yeah.

You're just gonna accept it de facto that that's good enough. I mean, no. I I'd also read through what the requirements were. I looked at what what they actually said. And whether that was equivalent to my interpretation of and uses requirements, or having read their rather lengthy ones as well. So you guys are just trusting me at this point because nobody else has done this. My only fear about this is maybe tangential. So I'm gonna try to keep brief. In a prior project, I on building, information models that I know in other groups would be much beloved in IETF because we love heavy data some information models in semantics, but I used to build things that were, like, bapping requirements in one control set to another. And the presumption that both parties map one to one. And presume that their mappings are equivalent in every way. Is usually, not how it happens in reality. So I guess I'll have to read the supporting documents, but I did volunteer to review and I guess that's kind of far for the course, but that's why I wanted to know how you were using this. But I guess now this getting me, getting rambling at about midnight. My time and not really corrective comment. There's probably other things to do. So, Hank, you're gonna cut me off after this. I'm gonna go you, and I'm gonna remove myself from the queue. Alright. So I do have a couple of, of of discussion points, which we may be out of time for. So cut me off if you need to.

To ATF, maybe to find somebody to talk about, maybe also find some solutions. And so thankfully, I have, here's a lot to present what problems we talk about But first of all, so what is our background? So, IoT in our meaning is not wireless. Because many people think IOT is always wireless. We make, network able things. So small switch. Some, and temperature sensor or something like that. Always connected to the network.

What's important to know and what I figured out here also always, already in the days. Our user is the normal average user, which previously connected sensors to MPLC. And now has to connect things via network and this is our goal to support him. And this is where we face the problem. It's not that any of a problem or issues I will tell I'm pretty sure everyone here in the room, can solve it. On the terminal, but the problem is how to, can we solve with the customer don't, face risk issues. So our normal, network, looks like this. We mainly have in switch. So no router. This is also one of the differences here. So everyone thinks network starts with a router. In our case, it's different because we have many offline setups, which are just sometimes connected to an Apple, a network. And so this offline, operation is a very important, just think of a plow is disconnected from detector, but has a lot of sensors, and we want to do maintenance. And this is a typical setup.

So, If you ask for a name, which is needed because nobody wants enter ipv4, 6 addresses by hand. And then and you will get back and List of, IP addresses. But in the situations, often it's, the host not in all these networks. For example, if you have an local, network where you have maybe for virtualization, assigned ULA addresses, Then the operator comes with its laptop, but with laptops will not accept this ruta advertisement. But within MDNS and, a resolution you will get on a unique local address, in the end, the, technical cannot access the device. And, also because where a lot of soft failures in between the user hand address of the solution, we think, or there are many problems, and we think it's just unnecessary because the user already tells the system in which scope wants to communicate, but but If it's local, yeah, just get back in link local address because, this is retriever. If, I want to connect insight and company network yeah, just, take in your address. If wants to connect to a global server. Adjust, and take in a global address here.

And so your system waits to a time out, while the system time out is longer than the browser time out for the user, again, cannot access the device. Or of our situations we had the name was sent to a global name server of a company. And, the name server assigned already in the address oh, okay. Maybe sometime in the future, this device will appear and send IP address, this device will never get And again, user cannot access. So also having here some, things working, but, not local addressing is not done, or, and rejected by, a name servers in this end would be helpful for yeah, this is we see, you know, what I seen here in the last days the zone ID, this is a real pity because of, the lacking support of the software. So our software can deal with that. But the user uses its laptop. You libraries like Noche S, and it's all yeah. It's not good supported.

Do you want questions as we go, or do you want questions at the end? As you want. So Okay. So, Michael, if you want if it's related to the this, you can come rightly. Probably 3. Yeah. So I I was intrigued by your last point. Creates more problems now than it solves later Exactly. So I agree it creates problems now. And you know, Yeah. I've been upset with the whole browser situation. But What problems do you think it solves later that aren't worth solving? So one is the ambiguity. If you have conflicting, link local addresses on several interfaces. So We don't have in most of the times. And so just a, a laptop of a user is probably an victim for this case, and then it's very unlikely. So, because with systems, always have just one interface. So the notes has just one also, our containers, Linux containers also have just one interface. But we all have who deal with the zone ID, which causes no problem but only on certain missions, there will be a problem with with a conflict, and to have the link local address on, the same link logo address on different, links. So Linates does not implement a default zone. Other operating systems do. Windows specifically does. If if Linux had implemented a default zone, Would that solve your problem? Most likely, yes.

So 90 Man, set a support for, offline environments, this is real, hassle. and For example, Chrome, deactivates, ipv6 completely if Chrome cannot reach an ipv6 server in the Internet. So if you're somewhere, just in local network with doesn't help much while the standard says ipv6 link Locals mandatory. So also Windows here, deactivates MDNS or local name or solution in unknown network. By default. So with technicians, typically have not the right to change the setting. Because of this, where computers are administrated by someone else, IT services. And services, also problem. Yeah. Of course, ipv6 address naming a solution is not working in this local environments, we come back to the zone ID, with problem. And, when also one problem is the support for the user. So when I switched to Apple, I think 8 years ago, We're voice in the browser and, and drop down bar where I could see all locally available web browsers as I see local printers in the printer dialogue.
