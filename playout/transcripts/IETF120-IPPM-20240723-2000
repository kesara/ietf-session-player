It covers a lot of information things like how we handle IPRs, etc It is also covering things like how we, our code of conduct, how we treat each other respectfully and so on So please, if you're not familiar with this, please take a look at it We are running this meeting over Meetecho, so if you are in the room, please register stuff with Meetecho using QR codes or other means. We will be using Meetecho for all the queuing. We will be sharing slides through Meetecho. We can run the slides for you or you can run them, but they will be shared via Meetecho We have a link for the notes, but we will need a note taker who can help us actually take the notes So if anybody would like to volunteer for that, we will be immensely grateful"

And so what this has to, what the situation really has to do with is the requirements of HPKE. And so we went into the HPKE draft and set and to see what they recommend for overflow situations. Next please And so this is out of RFC 9-180 which is the draft for HPK, I mean, there are for HPKE and the relevant part is that you need to have a sequence number which starts at zero And so they do have, they, what they really say is if the sequence number over a sequence number which starts at zero and so they do have they what they really say is if the sequence number overflows then you have to send a message and you must stop So that is what we shall do Next please so what we have done is to give a is what we shall do.

It doesn't, is completely non-disruptive to the end-to-end flow You just are not going to get data.

And that seems like it's not great, but it's not the end of the world. Correct Now with regards to expanding from 16 to 32, is that just so you can go for longer with measurements and do we, what do we think about the trade-off between between? getting measurements on these really, really long flows? compared to the extra bite overhead of now adding four extra bytes? to your overall extent Very interesting question. So, if you were at the AANRW keynote, where they were talking about the hugely expanded speeds and how we're talking about one millisecond now across huge pipes and how like the core 100, you know, 400 gigabits are being overflowed by how much, you know, how fast every the radio transmitters are getting to be at the core I'm really feeling like, and now, I'll get on my soapbox, a bit is no longer that expensive anymore. I'm not saying just pat it off out, but it's not like the old days. We're not living where you know I'm 24 bought anymore. And it's just getting, I think, I think it's just, as I say, that, that was a very interesting presence I think it was the guy from Microsoft, it was, talking about that and their internal stuff Anyway, yeah, cool so you don't expect any performance degradation or places where you won't be able to use media anymore yeah so you know"

So we're probably going to fight that and in our testing across the internet, if it is not somebody at the at the end point and I'm talking about a cloud provider, a CDN who's doing weird stuff this all extension headers work.

So thanks again for that and so we think it's I'm I said it's ready for working group last call in the slide, but it's almost ready because we got three questions again for the working group just before that. Next slide, please So the first one is just a yes or no or don't care it's also valid option provide some contexts uh please. So the first one is just a yes or no or don't care. It's also valid option. To provide some contexts, the NIST provide some recommendations on how you construct the nouns and also on its side And so basically we use the same recommendation, but we use a recommended initially and then we decided to replace it with a must"

    "text": "So obviously the advantage of a recommended is that it's not that too restrictive, so you have some liberty as an operator to as a vendor to implement it the way you want. But the must provides too big advantages. The first one is security because if you follow the specs the nis t recommends to have a non-size one is security, because if you follow the specs, the NIST recommends to have a nuns of size 12 bytes and to construct it in a specific way If you use it that way, you optimize the KU usage, so you don't have to play with, you know, key rotations and stuff at least not that much. And so that's really something we want And the other point is from interoperability point of view it allows us you know to store the idea of the encapsulating node inside the non so that it can be the key can be retrieved easily by the validator and it also provides some facilities to protect against replay attacks so just a simple question do you think that using must instead of recommended here is okay? Maybe should we have a pause? Maybe I don't know. Or you want to do that? at the end? I mean, no. Okay, Greg please comment I think getting comments are just like thumbs up, thumbs down for people is good here before we do actual number polls Nice for you.

So if you don't need it, then you just use the usual okay so then the integrity protection option oh okay so if you don't need it then you just use the usual okay so the okay so then the use is optional but if it's used, then that's a much. Yeah, I think that's reasonable yeah yes okay thank you for thank you for cover clarification. So just based on your comment if you use this you know extra header it's a specific option type so you instance, you get the pre-allocated trace option type, you would have the integrity protected trace option type, which is another code point, actually Does anyone have any objections to making it of us? I think that sounds quite reasonable I love these exact normative, like must if you do these things then you must do this. It's like, exactly All right, next slide, please So this one is more to choose between option A or B So in the Integrity Protection header, you got a field that is called method ID So basically it defines what method, what algorithm must be used by a node to compute the ICV and so the draft says the following right now, if a node encounters an unknown value, it must not change the contents of the IOMU integrity protection header and must not change the contents of the IOM data fields. In other words, the node must not process the IOM option type So this is what is currently present in current version, which means that if a node receives the method ID that it doesn't know, it does not implement, it would not add its IOM data anymore. So it's kind of having IOM not working for that node anymore, right?"

    "text": "So as an alternative, we have the same text and we just remove the last part and we would have if a node encounters and a non-value, it must not change the content of the IOM integrity protection header. So in that case you would insert IOM data no matter what. But in the end, it would break the validation of the integrity protection right? So we cannot have an agreement between what firsts. I'm personally more for option A, so the first one on top, Frank, for instance it's more for a second one But I'm afraid that if you go for the second one, so the one on the bottom, we would, you know, from, again, from an interoperability for a point of view, we would break you know, the whole thing. And since it's new code points, it's like new options so if you want to use the integrity just use integrity If it's not okay, just use the other one. So again, I don't want to influence opinions here, but just so that you have the know the the reasoning behind that so Gregner's gift Erickson. So, um what would be expected behavior? of decapsulating no if it understands their value? of the method ID. Well, actually in the draft, we provide some mitigation from performance risk point of view. So the validator is not necessarily the decapsulating notes so the decapsulating not can just delegate the work. But anyway, let's just assume that the decapsulate"

Yeah, that's more from transit notes point of view that we are thinking about it here, yeah so if you got a trace let's say we got ABCD and BC being transit nodes a and b and b and cap and decap let's say that B and C do not understand this method ID, you would have an empty trace well, B and C wouldn't insert data fields inside the trace, right? Right, that's something that I was thinking towards that because the missing data might be a good clue saying, okay, there was something that was not interpreted properly yeah so that because the missing data might be a good clue saying, okay, there was something that was not interpreted properly. Yeah. So, but if, uh, and implementation, because if I understand correctly, there are second option of the text allows for the transit node to add. In that case, B and C would insert IRM data but then they wouldn't have to update the ICV So at the end, the validation would fail no matter what. So that's, then what's their benefit? of adding this data? if the data because that's that's what I'm asking from the point of view of decapsulating note a note that analyzes their record the operational state information. So if this information will be discarded any state information. So if this information will be discarded anyhow, so then might be the first option because it's more deterministic and more strict I agree so seems like it's reasonable text"

Yeah, otherwise you kind of have half working and the other half not working all right Yeah, so this one is a little bit more complicated because we don't have a solution right now for this um so whatever the option type a transit node must not participate in the integrity protection which means it does not have to update the ICV if it does not add or update IOM data fields, right? So if it does kind of nothing, it makes no sense to update the ICV right otherwise you break again the integrity protection mechanism so this is meant fields, right? So if it does kind of nothing, it makes no sense to update the ICV, right? Otherwise, you break, again, the integrity protection mechanism. So this is mandatory here. And so we we had this text in previous version that we removed until we got a working solution. So it was if the transit node does not add any I that we removed until we got a working solution. So it was if the transit node does not add any IOM data fields. For instance, it only modified mutable IOM data fields or does nothing then the transit node must not update the ICV field in the IOM integrity projection header So we thought that this one was working and quite cool but in the end of the day it would not work for pre-arlicated trace. Because if you think about it, in pre-allocated trace, the encap node would pre-allocate the space for the IOM data field so it's like they are already there maybe not initial initial"

It would kind of update or modify the block that is pre-allocated right so I think it's confusing and we probably need to find another wording for that because here it's like those data fields are considered as mutable and not immutable So the question is how to distinguish the pre-alloc case from the other and we're still trying to find some text too represent that. So if you have any suggestions again right now or on the mailing list or offline we already use text to represent that so if you have any suggestion again right now or on the mailing list or offline we already will be really appreciated because it's it's really a matter of several words, but it can change the whole context so and we really needed that, because otherwise, you get some transit on that would screw the thing up so do we have any immediate comments to that?

So the idea is that for example, the method, the direct expert, of in situ OAM, allows for local policy to control how this information being collected. It could be the each of their information elements being exported as a raw data for the collector and for their network analytics processing or in this method with basically we create a sequence of packets that follow the same path as there are original trigger packet and thus simplifies the correlation of this informational elements so that they can be further dispatch for the processing to the collector or by the decapsulating node So the method works for point to point and point to multi-point environment environments and eliminating the duplication of their information because one of the things that, as we discuss, a regional for an"

Next slide okay so thank you for adopting this work and security discussion next so I'll raise some questions one of them is monitoring mapping of these and ECN. And we believe that it's already can be a change not using not extending functionality of this new rate measurement and multicast so basically what we call the asymmetric stamp extension, but using existing class of service TLV. So the class of service TOV, as it was standardized in 89 class of service TLV. So the class of service TOV, as it was standardized in 8972, allows not only to monitor change of DSTP and EC at the session reflector, but at the same time to have a testing of DSP marking and remarking on upstream and downstream one way so because their session sender can specify the value of DSP marking that must be used by the session reflector"

So then some security issues so some security issues were that what can be done to secure and mitigate the risk of amplification attack because as you recall so that this TOV allows for number of reflected packets being transmitted by session reflector in response to a single test packet received So, again, here we recommend using HMAC, T.OV or authenticated mode So that actually, that gives you flexibility because their base stamp test message can be clear and only extensions will be authenticated using HMECTIE TOV.

Yeah so Ignacio please Hi thank you great for the presentation Just a simple question You say that this two-wave measurement. I mean, it's round-trip time. Isn't it? or are you trying to, because a little confused? about if two-way or what? way the idea is measure the time the round trip with the reflector or? one other?

Okay because the reference the reference here round trip time is that as an estimate for free because the reference the reference here to round trip time is that as an estimate for frequency of trigger packets in certain environments. And we discussed that there was a question from Bjorn, if I remember correctly So what we agreed is that because to have this consistency we wanted to have round trip time, but as a protocol stamp is fully capable of measuring one way the delay and one-way packet loss No, yes, but to do that, you need some synchronization among notes Yes, that's again synchronization is beneficial, of course, but there are techniques of calibrating of offset in clock so that the can be accounted for when calculating metrics metric okay? So if we go back to O-wamp and T-wamp, so the clock synchronization there is not required It's definitely a strong recommendation but before proceeding with the test session the quack calibration is required they're required just a simple question because if you are sending a packet in one timestamp here and you receive here if the two clocks are not correctly synchronized, you cannot determine the time between the two ones okay this is this is the point but okay, I don't want to take more time"

Thank you, great. Thank you. And yeah, so again, so there was some questions that Tau raised in regard to the human error misconfiguration and mitigating excessive packet reflection.

You mentioned using the HMAC TLV in order to be able to mitigate some of the amplification attacks just one point that would be worth checking I'm not sure about that is whether the HMAC TLV can avoid replay attacks because basically there's a possible threat where an attacker can record a test packet with an HMACTLB and then replay that in order to recreate that amplification attack Oh, you mean that? replay? Yes, but at the same time, right, so this as a asymmetrical extension because it uh requests, multiple reflection, possibly multiple reflection packet being transmitted in the succession of maybe a short interval of time so yes that might be that might be that pose some risk although it's basically the same risk as any other case of using HMAG But let's let's let's let's let's as any other case of using HMAG. But let's let me think about it, how it can be further protected from the replay attack Because if I understand your question correctly, that basically they're a legitimate packet with the HMAX can be replayed that might be used as a attack vector. Right, exactly Okay, yeah, I think that there are some ways to mitigate that risk, but I need some time to think about it and just put it on the paper okay sure yeah thanks Thanks"

So regarding that security and I haven't looked at the latest draft updates, but there are two points one point was that reflector can always have a very decent check to make sure that the packet comes from the right source So it's locally provision value. You verify it and say, yeah, it is not the security issue. So this is something we had to do it for segment routing when we did that RFC 95 or through. We added some tax for it for the source and the second thing in the consideration the sender itself also has a rate limiting for the replies that comes comes to it so if if there is something maybe a reflector is misbehaving and sending a lot of packets back, the sender itself can also do a rate limiting to not get overwhelmed. So those two considerations could be helpful Yeah, that's very helpful but I was already in the back of mind thinking of Tau's question. So one of their problems well-known and broadly used replay attack mitigating tool is a monotonically increasing sequence number. So basically that very easy to use to detect whether it's a replay or as a matter of fact because their packet itself not extension, the packet itself has a sequence number to do packet loss measurement and detect reordering and replication. So basically, we already have a sequence number it doesn't have to be replicated into the TOV itself, so probably just, you know, text that's pointing oh, by the way, that can be used to mitigate"

And since you mentioned sequence number and there was a question on the one-way delay and one-way loss agreed that in order to do T2 minus T1, they both need to be using the same clock in order to do the math but for the one-way loss, since we say that applicability state less reflector and things like that, if you want to do one-way loss, then you need the state full reflector because it has a state for the forward direction sequence number in reverse direction sequence number and stuff like that So it's just a consideration that just to the previous question about one-way loss kind of thing that this has some interest with stateful and state yes thank you but I think that their point was an it's very accurate and correct appropriate point is that for one way measurement comparing to when you, we're doing the round three and then we estimate one-way by dividing in half, which is an only estimate. So to get accurate one-way measurement, clock synchronization with a specific one way by dividing in half, which is an only estimate. So to get accurate one-way measurement, clock synchronization with a particular accuracy is very important Agreed. Thanks Yeah. All right Okay. Thank you.

Many thanks to the working group for adopting and supporting and reviewing the draft and providing lots of good comments I think we have a addressed a lot of comments and there are some good comments as well that would like to socialize so hopefully it doesn't take 15 minutes but let's see how it goes Next slide agenda is to go over the requirements and goals and scope of the draft. The summary of the procedures to provide the context, various review comments. There is some work going on for extents in other working groups such as flashed the slides on that and the next steps steps next slide please so the requirements is that to reflect the extension headers first time it could be IPV6 extension header or the MPLS network action substack MNA work that's going on The objective is two-way as well as one-way measurements for hop-by-hop measurement as well as h H2S measurements. So that's really driving the work. The goal is that we want to leverage the existing implementation of those extension headers on meet midpoints. Recall that midpoints do not process them. They are agnosed to it. And also, try to avoid the IPV6 and MPR protocol extensions as well as part of this work the scope it is to stamp, then stamp TLVs the IPV6 extension headers as well as the MN substack It's the draft is going through working group last call in MPL"

There was highlighted The ambiguity is that there may be some cases where there are more multiple extension headers with the same land and maybe we don't want to reflect one of them with the same land. So it's kind of ambiguity and the solution is that we can add pre-field some fields like option type or length this where reflector can match on them and reflect what is requested Same way for IPV6 or MPLS has the same kind of option and TC"

So if you have any suggestions please let us know. Next slide So this is a it was a great com was a great comment to add the use reflected control TLV to not send the extension headers in the reverse direction so it's kind of one-way measurement and basically if there's IOM, no requirement happens in the reverse direction Just wanted to highlight that when we add this extension header control sub-tlV, means either you are adding all of the extension headers in the reverse direction or none so there is no controls add this or don't add that it doesn't work like that in the draft right now and we'll clarify that. And obviously we don't want to insert the receive routing headers back into that IPV6 because routing and SRH would have been for the forward path so we'll clarify a couple of points along those lines Next slide, yes So this one just shows an example, packet flow basically, where we see that IPV 6 extensions and headers added on the sender side but not on the reflector side because there is a reflected test packet control TLV present in the in the stamp But then we still copied the whatever is sealed in the extension header into stamp"

I know GCP talked about alternate marking So we'll discuss or socialize them and update the draft accordingly. Next slide So this has been there in the draft from the beginning, idea is to if you're going to do hop-by-hop measurement to use, let's say, pre-allocated trace option or POT option or direct decks option if you want to do hop-by-hop telemetry And basically, STEM carries this just like data packet and this is just used for the active measurement along with IOM next slide please.

So this is not in the draft There were some comments and let us know what you think think Next slide, please. There were comments from GCP Probably we should discuss a bit more. I think idea was that we can also use the stamp for alternate marking for IPFIC fix yang push along the way And there are consideration in a different draft along those lines so right now there is no use case example in this draft that talks about that and also doesn't have a case where there is no extent header to be reflected and no insert of the extension and reply packet for example.

Yeah, let's talk after the meeting yeah sounds good thanks There was a comment from Zen Chiang about having specific use cases because there is a lot of access and headers and stuff, but what does it mean?

So the blue line is a CDF of the network measured net And this is visualized on the right side of the slide here. So the blue line is a CDF of the measured network latency. And then these"

And then if the measured line crosses one of these thresholds we basically do a linear interval between them to produce a quality score and if it crosses more than one line then we take the worst one. So we always take the low score of these different lines So that's what the draft specifies is basically how to do this.

So on the x-axis we have the frequency of adding latency And that is no that is actually not the best way to put it it It's how many packets sorry sorry every, it's, so this for the vertical line label 20 represents the measure measurements where one out of every 20 package have added latency then it's like one over a have added latency. Then it's like one out of every 40th packet, one out of every 60th packet, one out of every the rightmost measurement here represents the case where 1% or 1 out of every 100 packets have added latency.

It is either so the application is not perfect when it's either the resolution drops or there are or frames are dropped So there are two things can happen if you have a live stream. Either the resolution is not perfect or as good as it can be or frames start to drop And then the blue line is where the app stops working which means the stream cuts out at various points and starts to buffer and so what we can see is if we add a relatively small amount of latency, but we add it very often then that breaks it very quick and as the latency is added less frequently or sort of the added latency, events become more rare, than the amount of latency that you have to add has to go up for the App 2 latency events become more rare, then the amount of latency that you have to add has to go up for the app to actually start degrading noticeably Okay, next slide, please So this is the same kind of plot, but for call of due run on a PlayStation 4 And this plot is set up in the exact same way.

So first, that the data supports this statement where we can claim that interactive applications are impacted by relative rare latency events, one out of every hundred packets even when the added latency is relatively small and then also there might be some neat scaling laws here, where if you run a few experiments for a specific application, you might be able to extrapolate and that you don't have to do it much testing as because that it might be an expensive and time-consuming thing to do So that's what I have to pursue"

But the second one is I did get how you because in the blue line, you can put every, the figure that you want when you have the blue line and red one why even if you take one packet over packet over 20 or one packet over 100 you have not stop walking stop working situation I couldn't understand why the application is not working. For example, in this case, Google Meet, you say, okay, I got one packet over 100, I added, I don't know 300 or 200 milliseconds and that stopped working I'm not sure I understood the question the question the blue line you say is not working the application is not working okay but yep it's for me it's very strange that you got one packet over 100 you add two 200 milliseconds and the Google Meet, it doesn't work Yeah, so, so what this book shows is if you add one if you add three seconds to every 100 packets,"

Thank you for the question all right Warren Not that at all. Quick question and apologies if I missed it. So when you're adding some latency sort of one in every 10 packets is that that you do nine packets and you add it to the 10th one and then, you know, another nine and you add it to the one after that or is these like statistically distributed it's this statistically distributed.

So there is an overlay in a network domain then the traffic is encapsulated at john border as in a marking node and then the capsulated on the other border in an unmarking node and all the transit node in the middle can read the data there are two different flavor two different type of measurement that can be done according to the usage of one flag or two flags one flag allow packet loss and single marking measurement while two flags allow packet loss as well and delay measurement can be done in a more accurate way according to the double marking method.

Yeah, I just want some clarification about some security recommendations What are the security recommendations from this draft? Yes. Could you? elaborate a little bit? Because, I mean, you're going to make sure that the source that wants your configuration is trustable, right? So what's in place in the draft I gotta be honest I don't remember I have read the draft a long time ago, so I don't remember the secret to considerations you mean you you're you're the security considerations this job yeah Yeah sure the is a security consideration section. All right let's talk about it right after all right Yeah. Please show the last slide Yes, this is the history of this chapter, so in a version, 02, working group version, I think there's improved security section So from the received comments on the security part so well I'm sure there's a security consideration Please follow up on that offline and if you have detailed comments, you can always address that in mainly list. Okay, thank you Great, and we'll coordinate with six-man chairs to I think, just have the last call go out to both groups sorry we'll coordinate with the six-man chairs to make sure that when they send out the last call, it's also sent to IPPM and that we get reviews there"

Tall, are you with us? Yes. Yes, can you hear me We can. Okay, great Okay, so this draft defines the ICMPV6 loopback and it has been around for a while now and we'd like to give an update about it. Next slide, please please So first of all, very briefly, what are we trying to do here? The idea is that the ICMPB6 loopback is kind of similar to ICMP echo except that when we send the loopback request from the sender to the responder, that what we see in blue at the top here The reply includes the blue request as the payload of the report So that means we get back to the center, the original IPv6 header of the request all the IPV6 extension headers, the option and so on And just as a side note, this is very similar to the way ICMP error messages work today. Next time please So what do we get from this? First of all, the first use case is IOM So if we have an encapsulating node which sends a kind of a ping loopback request to the decapsulating node, we can get the reply, which includes the original idea options of the request. That means also the IOM option. So that means using the IOM option, the sender encapsulating nodes can actually display the measurement related information on the forward path"

    "text": "Next place And also there are a lot of other use cases which may benefit from blueback for example path tracing, which is a draft that has been presented in IPPM in the past IFA, it can be used for example, as the follow-up message in hybrid two-step, okay? just a follow-up which comes after the trigger message It can be used for SRH referral You get an SRH on the forward path and then you get it back using the loopback reply. And there are a lot of different other use cases, which are not described here. Next slide please please We have been working on a demo. This demo is a available. The code of this demo was available on GitHub and the idea of this demo is it's very similar to Ping, to the well-known thing utility, except that it uses IOM So that we use an ICMPB6 loopback request, which has an I to the well-known thing utility, except that it uses IOM. So that we use an ICMPB6 loopback request, which has an IOM IPV6 option. And then when we get the loopback reply we can display all the IOM related information to the user and that's exactly what we see here we basically get the same information as pink, but in addition to that, we also have the per hop information of I.OA Next slide please So this is some of the discussions we had on the menu had on the mailing list. I won't go over all the different comments. One thing that I think is important to discuss here is which working group, this work should be discussed in It has been presented in six men and actually there was another different"

    "text": "draft in six men which had a similar goal but a different way to implement that goal so since some of our main use cases are related to IPPN it's not really clear whether this is a six-man kind of draft or an IPPN kind of draft So that's kind of an open question Next please okay so what are the next steps? One thing is to potentially merge this. Like I said, there's another draft another draft in six men which is kind of similar in terms of the goals. So there are some discussions about the potential to merge these two drafts. In either case, the two drafts are mostly relevant to IOMs is the main use cases but although discussions about the potential to merge these two drafts. In either case, the two drafts are mostly relevant to IOM is the main use cases, but also to other use cases And again, once we decide which working group is the best way to talk about this working group adoption call is also something that we're happy to hear whether work currently ready for that Thank you. So while Greg goes up to the mic, I think that's yeah, this is a good thing. We will coordinate with the six-man chairs on this and I think we regardless of where we would make a potential adoption call, we will make sure to synchronize that across the group Greg, please. Yes, thank you uh greg mirsky ericsson uh thank you tell for present I think that there interesting topic might be to discuss and look at a correlation of ICMP of information collecting over the core path of ICM packet compared to traffic that we assume that being monitored"

    "text": "for example, UDP. Because if I understand correctly, so because the ICMP is not a UDP base so that world balancing in ECMP environment, might work differently So then their information collect the nose links traverse by ICMP packet might be different so diverted from the path of, for example, UDP-based packets so that's right something that might be interesting to this discuss and really say it so what measures could be taking to make this correlation accurate and then their for example, on path telemetry in the operational stage? information relevant to the path that being characterized Okay, thank you Yeah, right. I think the question of ICMP versus UDP or actually ICNP versus TAM is a valid question. I think, you know, there are two valid protocols, the IDF is working on. Each of them has its own use cases I don't think it's either one or the other. I think it's actually both, but potentially different use cases. Like you said, when you use stamp over UDP it allows you to mimic the behavior of ECMP so we may be able to forward that gets through a different path but ICMP is a very widely deployed in a lot of different environments It's deployed by switches routers, as well as hosts. So again, I think there is a valid use case for both of them"

Thanks Rakesh Thank you very much agree with you, the agree with you, Tal, that, yeah, there is, you know, case for ICMP for many parts of the network or many operators would use that and there is case for stamp, so both are needed Thanks. Thanks Okay, any other opinions in the room about? kind of like the venue for this? work progressing? It's one thing we'd like to hear people chime in on. We can also do that on the list certainly. Okay Very good All right, with that, we are moving on to our Lightning Talk section Thanks all So we don't have a lot of time We have 13 minutes. We have too many drafts to get through But again, our general approach here is that we want just kind of like a one slide intro to the various topics so let's start with the other ones from Hengshi I. If we can kind of pick just, just tell us like one slide to jump to that we want to cover and just have a very quick"

Yeah, I can't go to slides to. Actually, I can go through the slide very quickly yeah so I will like to discuss new mechanisms called the congestion measurement for the for connection the congestion metric of the pests including the bottom leg bandwidth or Q utilization or total Q&A For use cases such as load balancing or congestion control, and network debugging, basically the sending note marked the congestion measurement header and the transit node We'll update the congestion info in each hall and the receiving nodes will export the congestion measurement results. Next slide, please Yeah, here is a very simple example, for example we would like to measure the bottleneck bandwidth utilization and it will be updated per hope. And the operation in per hop is a max. So it will only update when the bandwidth utilization is bigger than the value in the packet And here we define a lot of congestion info and it's packed in a bitmap multiple times so you can collect in multiple congestion info at the same header And the main point is that it's a fixed header size because each hope only updates the congestion info value. It will not add a at the same header and the main point is that it's a fixed header size because each hope only updates the congestion info value it will not add any new information And this header can be encapsulated in various data plan. We propose the IPA6 DOH or Hope by Hope header in the fall-in drop We welcome the discussion or comments. We are open to the suggestion of the congestion info or income encapsulation. Yeah, that's all"

I'm going to introduce flow measurements in IPV6 network, including third drafts. Next please All right and yeah, for these, can we let's figure out which which slide would you like to focus on for the light? talk here? Okay, the first one Okay In the first drop, I defined flow monitoring tour to mark the measurement, mark the measured IPV6 traffic by encapsulating its in a different position of IPV6 header, the measurement mode of end to end and hop-by-hop can be achieved So next please please And at present, both China Mobile and China Tonic Telecom have a organized IPVSA flow measurement tests as some manufacturers have supported and passed the relevance test. Moreover, China, China organized IPVC flow measurement tests and some manufacturers have supported and passed the relevance test. Moreover, China Mobile, Zergang branch has also carried out on practical deployment So next the second the second draft as an extension of flow monitoring option due to the current multiple network controllers, resulting in sufficient measurement accuracy in fV6 traffic in order to obtain better"

Next, please the measurement mode are divided into types, source node mode and anode mode, which respectively represent the nodes responsible for completing the computing text, whether the source mode or the N node is responsible for the computing, the information transfer on the measured passes increased the default sum TL the N node is responsible for the computing. The information transfer on the measured passes increased. Therefore, some TLVs are defined in this draft to complete this work. And next third draft please. And the third draft was complete to solve the ink inconsistent round trade path problem of devap and servicesics policy measurement by ink encapsulating the path segment in the SRH the reflector can complete the mapping of the consistent round-tray pass Okay, next please This three drafts have been presented twice in the ATF 150 and 118 p.m. working group made meetings. Also, this time we want to ask for adoption gone and some comments and feedbacks. So thank you and thank you for actually being very fast going through this even though several slides and several documents. Please to everyone who think this is interesting engaged on the list and discuss this this allows us to give the documents more time on the next meeting and then we can move further and consider things like adoption calls and so on so please everyone if you're interested in this engaged please put your comments on the mailing, thanks. Thank you All right you have one slide, right? right?"

We called on-part telemetry because included both alternate marking and I am telemetry data so you see that the young model is a little bit longer. But we included both and we tried to of course use some parameters that are in common like time bit longer but we included both and we try to of course use some parameters that are in common like timestamp acquisition method demission type and so on this is the first draft, or please have a look and comment comment is there another Oh, yeah, it's your fault have a look and comment. Is there another? Oh yeah, it's just for you. Yes like lightly There we are. Next Yeah, and this draft is related to the comment in the discussion with Rakesh. So as I said, in several scenarios active measurement, both by op and then to end are needed. So with active test packets can be used in combination with hybrid methods to perform on-path active measures So the case of an ECMP, ICMP V6, OAMP, stamp, where the hop-by-hop option, for example, in case of IPV6 header, can be used in combination with active tools to perform on-path active measurement So this is just to generalize the idea Different alternatives are possible You can use Yang to configure, IPFix or YANG notification to report telemetry data And of course, the stamp TLV has proposed by Rakesh in case of stamp of course, since the draft is general so also in this case we i'm"

Let's go to the third slides Yes, we can jab. Okay okay. So the problem is that in some scenarios, the center can't know the written paths in advance, but it requires the written paths be the theme as the forward path to do a round-trip performance measurement. So we define a new flag in the stamp written and pilots can show code a suburb to indicate the transnode to insert the node information to the under the session Reflector to realize the report test packet along the same path The figure below shows an example of the co-routed B-D-Rond replace the reflected test packet along the same parts. The figure below shows an example of the co-routed B-directional path measurement And please go to next slide slide and nest and nest next is a sample it retention for multipartes. Also we have the multi-path measurement could be achieved by constructing different IPV6 flow labels or MPRS entropy labels, but it's hard to know whether all the earlier paths has been measured"

So we extend the stamp with a multipart TRIV, the TRIV contains an ambit to indicate whether this test packet is for a multipart measure or not If there are multi-paths to the destination, that note needed to replicate the test packet at each outgoing interface This multipartive needs to be combined with the reflection stamp packet header's extension to indicate the root parts collected in the IOMA trace option And furthermore, if you want to perform a round chip measurement it still needed to combine with the core root B-directional path-matcher intentions The figure below also shows an example of multipass active round-chance measurement And that's all, thank you Any comments and suggestions are welcome Thank you very much, and we actually managed to run through all the lightning talks on time that's pretty amazing so thanks to everyone for brief and lightning fast presentations. And to all of you who have seen these presentations, please, if you think this is interesting, any of these topics, reach out, discuss them. This makes it much easier for us to understand which documents are relevant to schedule for more time on the agenda and also figure out what could be candidates for adoption in the working group Okay, with that, thank you all for participating and thanks to our note taker Appreciate your being coerced into doing so All right.
