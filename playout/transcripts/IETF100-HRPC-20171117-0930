    "text": "unintended effects of the standard protocol so that was also difficult for an non expert I think it is perhaps even creative work and harder perhaps to take up an ich end of logical fashion and the assumption that has to be made and this goes back to what John Levine said which is the person doing the Human Rights protocol consideration has to assume that the trade-off or the optimization between competing human rights imperatives has already been done by the working group and I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s the job of the protocols consideration to actually completely open out that debate because protecting the right to property for example might need certain infringement on the right to privacy and so on next slide please so now but going into some of the criteria that is part of the assessment and these are the first thoughts I\u0027ve had this is starting with connectivity so what it seems like is there is no application specific functionality added to intermediary nodes second that the framework cannot be developed in a stateless manner that\u0027s what we thought was possible was was impossible and we\u0027ve heard some kind of anecdotal evidence that it is perhaps not optimized for low bandwidth countries but we were not able to find any online reference to this or any academic literature on this point next slide so it is it ok make couple more comments this point on point two and three I am NOT it sort of depends on it maybe my understanding of how you use the term stateless but I\u0027m not actually sure that\u0027s correct there are there ways to use OAuth where you use asymmetric crypto where you don\u0027t have to keep state in in the notes but this may just be me misunderstanding how you use the term and the third point there is something called the ACE working group in in the IDF which sort of has profiled OAuth for the use in for for IOT and low bandwidth situations so that I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s true either thank you thank you so much for that moving on on Revathy again they had told me to think it through so I thought about it a little bit from the perspective of a non-technical end-user "

    "text": "so what seems to be the issue is the audit of authorized authentication period and in some of our kind of telecom regulation this was required that the data controller constantly check with the data subject whether the they are authorized to continue to do or use their data for a particular purpose and that kind of changed things quite dramatically so I mean one way to deal with this to say that question like this is completely out of the scope of the standard and the standard should not be prescriptive about this particular question but if you look at the usage of the standard very broadly and you look at some of the research that\u0027s out of there out there it seems that most users end-users are unaware of these extended authorization periods so that was a solution that we came up with I again don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s appropriate at all but that\u0027s on my slide next slide in terms of content agnostic so this we thought was an easy one it seems as if the standard is completely continent agnostic at least as part of the initial process and also the content that is delivered finally next slide on security this really took a lot of time and it was still not able to read everything or even understand the concern and erst and the implications fully for human rights the working group has done a lot of work there is already the security considerations in the standard itself and there are two are the documents that go into security threats and mitigation modules the community hasn\u0027t come to consensus this is what that is still going on but it was as I said earlier it became a bit unclear what we should do what I should do as part of the human rights considerations look at the existing threats and mitigation models the current best practices and so on and think through what some of the scenarios would be for human rights violations or make it easier for somebody from the human rights world to understand the work that is already done there\u0027s actually a conference where security of what is discussed so there\u0027s a lot of work and "
