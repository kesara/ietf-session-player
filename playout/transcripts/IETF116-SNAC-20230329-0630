We would like to get this document in a very good shape. Especially notice that there are very minor changes since the version we had from last meeting. So Please review the document and In terms of agenda, I just updated you from the chairs side. Ted is going to present remotely, he will give update on the document and please ask as many questions as you have from him, After that, we have another work which is related to lan prefix delegation and team is going to that work. And since it's a very light agenda, we have time for discussion any other topics that you would want to raise in the meeting. So with this that I'm going to share you slide deck Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. Great. Okay. So this is just a quick update on where where we are with the stack simple document right now. Excellent. So we posted a dash zero in September and then go. Yeah.

We already have one for the behavior of of the stub rather on the infrastructure network in terms of router advertisements. So just the idea is to do something equivalent for net sixty four because right now, is pretty under specified Next slide? So I think what's missing in the document right now is somebody other than me to look at it. And and that's not to say I'm not gonna do this but somebody other than me and Jonathan really to look at it and think about how they would implement it. Because But this is a challenge always when you're writing a document like this that you know, like, I know exactly what I did to implement it. And when I write the document, I think that I've down everything that I did. But that somebody else comes along, and actually tries to do the implementation and they have a lot of questions. So it'll be really great if somebody who hasn't done implementation of this would sit out. You actually have to do it patient of it, although that would be awesome if you did. But just sit down and read the document and think about, like, you know, what code would you write? Have to write it. Then some questions. So another thing that is sort of I would say an open issue. I think it's actually a pretty good shape is stub or a flags document. We added that because we want wanna be able to differentiate between"

So don't wanna to go a situation where you have two stub routers, the infrastructure that are servicing perhaps different sub networks. And each of them advertise in Ra and each of them sees the other routers Ra as being an infrastructure service. And so each of them says, oh, gosh, there's argument been for search for service they're all stops advertising mine, because the infrastructure service is always gonna be preferred. And if that happens, then what you'll see is that the two routers will fight with each other. The idea with the Flag is just to say, this is an advertisement for a sub hours, so don't consider it to be infrastructure and therefore you know, don't don't get to fight with me. And there's a there's a a in the spec it tells you how to if you see a competing stub advertisement what to do. In order for that to happen, we need this document. Published And this is not a document that the snack working group can do because it's really a six man document. However, we took this to six man in London. And they were very receptive to it, but they basically said, you guys write the document, get it into the shape that you wanted and then bring it to Like, don't make us do work on it in this working group because you guys are the ones that actually need this. So that's kind of one of the tasks before us. And then, you know, there's just various things like, I I looked at... I I reread the document a little bit while I was preparing the slides. So I noticed that section eight you know, there's useful information at section eight, but it doesn't really tell you why it's there. I think that that needs and work. And I suspect that there are more things like that. So I think we need to make another pass through the document looking for stuff like that. It's always good to look at it fresh. So next slide."

Right now, the only complaint that I that I had when I re reread the document before, you know, I preparing slides was maybe applicability statement should come description of the option. So That's a pretty minor knit, but I think it'd be worth worth fixing. And then I think it be good to get a little clearer about when to send the the sub router flag. And, you know, like or where is that and I should say, Do we only use an infrastructure, Do we also use it on sub network. We talked about this Last time, and you know, the question was, like, is it useful to to use the stub... The stuff flag everywhere. We're just places where we're sort of joining as a stub router. So sort of advertiser would be, like we just use it whenever we send a router advertisement enjoy or would be. We only use it context where we're joining an infrastructure network. So next slide, So, basically, I think the advantage of the joiner model is let's us tell whether there are other routers on the infrastructure And if we see a stub router Ra on the stub network, then that's an indication that something is configured. Right? Like, Because if we're if we're not sending a step router flag when we set an our on on the stub network. But then we receive an ra way that's got a rot flag set."

This the stuff... The stuff flag are on the on the sub network. But I think the idea is to just to detect that in correct configuration I think it actually works better to do it with the joiner model. I'm actually sort of realizing that as a slide I apologize for only noticing that. But it's obviously, it was useful to put the down on the slide. So the of the question is like, do we wanna say something like, if the robert sees something like that, what does it do? Then you know, we wanna talk about a user or interface to inform the user or something like that or don't think we can really do anything adaptive this that's like... That's what we tried to do at home man and I think that's out of scope here. Next slide. So as I said, let's get the stub out of document for six man. Told you what I think about it. I'd appreciate it if other folks could could think about what I've said and look at the documents and see what they think about it. Like, having just explained the joiner model and the advertiser model to have really leaning towards the joint model. Which actually is great because it means less work. But it would be great if other people could think about this and see what they think. And that as I said earlier, really would be helpful to have somebody who hasn't implemented this go through it.

And I I think we have the text that we need. Basically, I mean, the answer to your question, which I is in the document is in principle, the infrastructure stuck... The infrastructure router advertisement, is going to always win unless it's flaky. Right? And if it's flaky, there's not anything we can do about it. And if there are other routers, we have an algorithm we basically do an election. So Right. If So so there shouldn't be flap in because if if two routers advertise, one of them is gonna see the the others advertised and say, oh, That one wins the election. I'll stop advertising. And the other one's gonna see the first routers advertisement say, oh, that one loses the election I'll keep advertising So I don't think we're gonna get clapping, but I definitely, you know, you I'm sure you've you've got many has have many experiences with with Rogers if you see anything we can fix, please tell me. So typically, where this comes up is when it's a wireless up, So it's mh like a mesh type setup up, but it's doing it a layer three. And the wireless multi cast packets are disappearing. Is when this... It's not actually link flap as much as it's packet loss. Is when always goes south. And so that's you know, it they look the same. Right? Link flap looks exactly like that.

Which Tim's can talk about a minute. Then that would enable global reach ability. But also, if you if you don't have Dhcp v six prefix delegation. You can still use Nav sixty forward to reach out to the cloud. But you wouldn't be able to receive packets from the cloud other than through the than that. Translator. Okay. So if it's also included, Maybe we should do think about Ip b firewall function. I think it's related the Up function also. Yeah. So I have we did talk about that. But the problem is having a firewall on an automatic device is problematic because our goal is to be is to enable communication with the infrastructure network So if we have some kind of automatic firewall in place that prevents communication with structured network than we failed. And so we've been assuming that the infrastructure network already has firewall. And that would normally be the case, like a typical c router that follows our seven eighty four has a firewall. So that firewall is gonna protect the router as well. This is not to say that there isn't potentially work to done to improve the situation like for example, you might want some kind of isolation between your Iot network and your main network yeah think that would be an interesting thing to pursue. I don't think it needs to be in the base document though because I think we still get you know, functionality that we need in the base document and So so to me, that would be more of a value added than an absolute requirement."

We're were doing a home that thing, there were some experiments done with Md and S bridging And Ultimately, the conclusion is that that just doesn't work. And so if you're gonna have The ability to discover devices on the stub network from the infrastructure network. You need some way to do that. It doesn't necessarily have to be our key. But the problem is if it's not sr, how do you get it up to the infrastructure? And so the nice thing about Sr is that it allows you to maintain a dns so And And that's done through you know, Uni house communication with the devices that are advertising the service. And then if you want sort of permission advertising on the infrastructure network. You can do that with a discovery. Sorry advertising proxy. But that kind of falls apart if you're doing S on both sides. I wouldn't say that it's impossible, but it's definitely an uncharted territory. And so we haven't really tried to solve that problem because we really wanna move the direction of is that doing less multi cast dns and more cast Dns. So there's work going on in the Dns steel working group. To move in that direction and also in other standards bodies other Seo, to to...

For the sort of Wi Wi F sub network case, Obviously, you know, you can't assume the devices that are connected to the stub network we're Wifi Know how to do Sr. And so in order to enable that use case, we would either have to just require the devices that are using that network actually implement Sr, which might not really be plausible or come up with a with with an solution that solves the problem better than just a bridge.

So This is a draft wrote to try to solve the problem of Isps are assigning prefix lengths larger than sixty four to a network. So they're doing the the great work of sixty one seventy seven or not just less you're at a place where your service provider is just giving you size sixty four, they exist. But There are a lot of Isps we're given out more than sixty four. The problem we're having today, is that it unless directly connected to that edge gateway from your service provider you can't use all of those lovely addresses they're giving you. And that's because Typical Ip six routers do not have a Pd running on the lan interface very few. We looked at, like... I think we have thirty five different implementations or something we looked at and I found two that actually had it and you had to turn it on. It didn't come standard with the box, you had to do some configuration. So this draft is trying to solve that problem and take the these large prefix pools that we're getting whether it's a fifty six or sixty year, or whatever it is. And go to links beyond know, directly connected to the service router. So that's the problem we're trying to solve. One thing to note here is we're not trying to solve the a problem not provisioning with the draft we're not trying to hurt it in any way or make it worse, but we're not trying to solve the problem of you have two x from your network and how that would work. That's different problem for somebody else to work on. Or maybe later. Next slide. Okay. So couple of top biology maps here. This is a pretty straightforward one. This is what happens today as I say? This is a slash fifty six from your service provider. He gets it on the lan interface, he puts out a router advertisement. There's a Pd request that comes from another seventy eighty four ladder.

No global v, you could do funny things with Ul laser and horrible very hard things to configure here, but That's that what we wanna do. So what the draft suggests kinda has been the next one. So... Yeah. Oh, right. Let's talk about this. So one of the things we have a couple of options going forward. For those familiar, and this room there by a couple of people with the home net The home suggestion we spent a lot of time looking at hierarchical. Prefixes and what that really means is the edge router gets that slash fifty six or flash whatever and you come up with some sort of algorithm for figuring out how to split it up. And then you try to do the best. It's basically a distribution where you have to figure out how you're gonna break it up. It gets pretty complex. Right? All the documents that we wrote for home that about this where complex and to be completely honest scared everyone away. So is another attempt addict going the other route. We talked about this in home net but decided that Hierarchical, we were doing a lot of other stuff at the time and we thought that was better, but here we are. No like deployed. So I think this is the middle ground here. It's a flat What we're suggesting in this document is that there's an Isp edge the see router at the edge here. Says, hey, I've got these prefixes, and it's giving out multiple outside of it. So it's a flat set up and I'll talk more about that in future top apologies. So this is the really simple one. This is very straightforward. This is Utopia for us if this is what happens. This one the edge router gets a fifty six. And then but in this case, now it's got Pd turned on"

You know, this is if you take a router and plug it into the one year service provider gives you or the that you're using at your edge network. You plug in another router and it can talk to it. It could be a snack router. Obviously, in this case, it would work just fine. I put seventy eighty four on this because more we'll talk about you know, as snack routers go further away from the edge, it becomes a problem. So we'll talk about that in a second. Okay. So this is the one I get the most questions about. I call this complex. It doesn't look that complex, but it definitely causes problems. So this top here, you have two routers underneath your edge router. And they're both gonna ask for Ia d's. In this case, they can ask for larger hints, but you're only gonna give them a slash sixty four at first. And that they all get sixty four as they're handing it out. This one you know, regular Pd rules here, you get a request on link, you can easily send back the Dhcp message back them saying, hey, Here's your prefix. You can assign it to the land. All of this just works today. This is pretty well known, regular Dhcp nothing fancy is happening in this top. And the last one, here, this is where the fancy stuff. Starts to happen. So in this case, what's what's happening here is you've gotta get the Pd on this bottom router here. All the way up to the edge router. So what we've done to keep the flat hierarchy is we turn these middle routers into relay agents in Dhcp par. So what we've done here is the snap router sends up Pd request.

Let's say, the the request is for another length like like slash sixty two or Could you just briefly blaine maybe why why that's needed? So... Right. The the the reason I do it that way is so you can easily tell who has all the prefixes if you allow hints and stuff then you have to figure out how to break them up, and we're back to the high Model, and that's an nasty business.

Just to show what is actually at the edge and the other one sitting in the house. Okay. Yeah. That's clear. Thanks. So you we without any had. About your"

And my feeling mailing list? So I don't want to give read audio made there. Okay. I will I will make sure to do that. Thanks Eric. Thank you. Good you back. Klein. I recall correctly, which I may not. From home, some of the complexity was when people like unplug routers and plug them in differently. And it was supposed to like magically re... Could yeah. So so there went there wasn't every number in this scenario, I assume There's remembering? Yeah. I mean so... Yeah. The the original home that then we had two problems originally. One was trying to figure out what up and down was. If you remember we had the whole you could plug in your way in interface. You didn't have to define your way in interface one of the ideas that was at a home net? Yeah. And so some of the problems came from that because you were trying to figure out where up was and we're down. Was. Right? And then we've broken up in different ways. In this case, numbering hypothetically, should just work like a regular Dhcp prefix number event. Right? Because, again, we're just building us on top of Dhcp So what'll will happen is is the c router here we'll get a new prefix and then it would eventually we propagate down. What upside here that often we say we can't use Dhcp v six reconfigure. But every seventy eighty four router has that built in. So you could, actually, in this case, use reconfigure all the way down. And actually, reno to the entire network. If the get the six Pd client uses the same identifier and uses the same s sixty four in the hint. You can ignore the hint if it's not sixty four, Yep. Perhaps. Yes. You... You were talking about adding recommendation? Yep Would that be possible to just have it real allocated?"

And then a because the router would know that there maybe a link down let down of or would know that the stream ready yeah. I mean, we Right. And all this is something happens it should do a rebound and go and ask right? In Dhcp terms, it it'll should do a D bind and say, hey, what's my P is is still right, and it can answer it and say, no. No. No. I've learned all new stuff or it might actually just work. Yeah. It'll just work yeah. Theory. Sounds. For for for for large values of work, Can I hop in the answer to that? If you move the sn router to a different upstream link, it's gonna fix the state on the new path, but the old path may have broken stage Right? Yeah. That's true. Yep. Point. Ted fire away. If that's alright. The the The broken state situation is probably not quite as bad as it seems. And one way to address it So the the way that would work is essentially you've got the the Dhcp server knows where to set the package. Right? And so if if the router gets plugged into a different placed top The path to the router is gonna get fixed. And the path to the router the the the old path of the router is gonna be somewhat irrelevant, but you can still send reconfigure if if you wanna clear it up, and it might be worth thinking about how to do that. But additionally, Well, I I'd say actually sending we reconfigured it's probably the the the best way to to to address it just actually just said a reconfigure"

Then you said the actual response got another path. Yeah. It's the... It's the relay agents learning the routes. Is where this is gonna be a little problematic. That's what I mean, you would have to basically... So so when you got the original prefix delegation request. That came through a series of relay agents. So the D server principle knows which agents that came through. So if that is that path remains except for the the very end of it. Or even if some part of that path remains then if you send some kind of Dhcp message encapsulated through it with the same ro off basically, the the clear the route instead of adding the route. Then that should clear out the old state. Mean, to some extent, you know, we shouldn't even really be talking about this because we should just solve this problem with a routing protocol. But But the extent that we wanna do something to address sort of the easy status use case I think you could actually do that. Yeah. Let me I'll think about that. There there there might be some mechanism we can use I mean, they're there's least query. There's some other things we could play with here. Yep. Lee Graham might be the answer to this problem as well having the relays talk to the server occasionally and say, hey, Is this guy still here? Who might be the... Concern about that it's like how much complexity do we wanna add to solve this when we should really just protocol? Yeah. You just say just use a routing protocol. It's easy. Everybody does it. No. No. No. No. No. Yeah. I mean, that that's what we're trying to avoid here for sure. Right? I I don't"

Yeah. Thank you. Right. What I... What I would say to the whole routing vertical thing is like, yes. It's true that riding... Protocols are complicated and routing vendors are probably feel a little bit allergic to them, but it never hurts to ask. Right? So I would actually be inclined to to say something about... So a whole bunch of work was done in the va working group to come up with a routing protocol that was sort of automatic and easy. It's all configuring and you know, I don't think we could... I don't think we're in a position to work why the people who with that, but we could certainly at least say If you're gonna end up four hours just responding to previous question.

I could introduce you to some people, you've already sent them Yeah. The the pull... So the thing about this is in this draft we we can talk about that actually. I I don't have a whole lot of text about the way interface. I just kinda copied seventy eighty four. And did that deal. So I'm happy to to put some text in there if we think there's I mean, funny things going on on that network. See yeah ted I would welcome that. Great. Yeah. I mean, I think part of that really just needs to be another document that says if your Isp here's is what you should do, but to the extent that we mitigate it by putting something in seven eighty four plus this, I think this worth doing. Okay. Yeah. I I I think we could definitely give them think we should talk about it from the perspective of this is how service providers have done this for sure. Right? And these are some common issues and service providers. We could talk about that from the seventy eighty four Router perspective for sure. Cool. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. Hi, Lorenzo. I I I wonder I don't know if you've very talked about this, but happens if the Asp gets a delegate, like, a relayed request before it gets the one for the main Sea router. Because like, the Ip six root is is is also a seven eighty four router. Right? Yes. So if the one in the middle sends a request before the one and at the top, has started up their client. Then you have like a stab broken situation. Right? Well, what's gonna happen? So so right, if if the C router, I have labeled here."
