Lawrence wants to talk for a little bit some updates some working group business some new stuff and of course a special guest at the end because I always love a little crazy going on so David do you want to do your little thing about dough so David Lawrence is one of the co-chairs of the DNS over HTTPS because everything\u0027s gonna be over HTTPS and next you know if it\u0027s not already ntp over HTTP so I just wanted to bring to your attention that the one single document that the DNS over HTTP working group has been working on is trending towards being wrapped up and we\u0027re probably going to end up moving it to last call after this meeting that\u0027s a discussion we\u0027re having endo but since many interested people are likely in this room as well and might not have been aware how close that was - getting finalized you might want to show up at the working group meeting which is Thursday mmm session one Thursday afternoon session one - if you have some input on that document thank you thanks Dave and if you\u0027re worried about us getting out of here on time my better half is here and we\u0027re going to "

    "text": "sounded more like we have too many RFC\u0027s that are actually isolated because they add features that are brought forward by by a small or pretty much small use cases the bigger issue though is one of architectural oversight and that is something that sounds nice in academic environments and so on and so forth maybe it\u0027s hard in reality but one of the problems is that and we see that in the political as well in the technical space too much is diverted to the identifier layer there\u0027s too much done with the DNS that would belong elsewhere and maybe the ship has sailed or the horse has left the barn or whatever the image in your favorite languages but this needs to be pushed up a level just say no is again very famous phrase but doesn\u0027t always work but it\u0027s it\u0027s about standardization politics and not so much about listing or RFC\u0027s thank you try not to laugh and I say this john clinton the ability to make a new feature work may be a necessary condition to its being a good idea but it\u0027s not a sufficient one i think that is close to the key point Burt and I have tried to make a repeat the last part I think that is close to the key point Burt and I have tried to make now I\u0027m Mark Andrews vine sends responses that break those of these servers and the biggest problem is bad implementations Thanks so well thank you so much for setting designs apparently this is work well so cope so sorry sorry as someone who does operations on a daily basis this is why I wanted you to bring these up because I think about this as well right and when we talked to our vendors we talked to our software we sort of you know we are op DNS op right that is what we do and we do have a lot of employers in here or we do have a lot of operators in here but we sometimes lose focus of that and it\u0027s sort of good to sort of like and and when we of course when I put up the slide saying we have so much work we need to add a third chair I kept thinking and then birthday talk at the end about how much we have to what we\u0027re adding too much stuff to the protocol right so I it\u0027s a you know there\u0027s a dichotomy there but I appreciate you doing this and I do think you know we do think about this the TCP folks have been trying to approach this by sort of redoing 793 but very slow piecemeal but it\u0027s not sexy it\u0027s like no one gets any like you know lauded for that right it\u0027s just like it\u0027s the most ungrateful you know unappreciative work sort of thing and we kind of I\u0027ve always sort of wondered is that what DNS has to do at some level and nobody\u0027s going to want to do it right they\u0027d rather go build something new because that\u0027s kind of cool and you know I really loves you sort of thing so yeah I appreciate that "
