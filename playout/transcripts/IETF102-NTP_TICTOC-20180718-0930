    "text": "fair amount of opposition to it so it we need to to resolve that and and it may be that that some of the things that you\u0027ve identified it I think some of the opposition comes from people that are unhappy with the changes that are being made and some of the opposition comes from people that just don\u0027t really quite understand the text yet so that\u0027s why I that\u0027s why I specifically asked you if you could take a look at it and work on it sure yeah so I\u0027ll see if I can come up with some alternate language after consulting with Harlan that makes things a little bit clearer so we have both existential opposition and just I don\u0027t I don\u0027t get it we don\u0027t understand the rationale and the rest and and the other thing that I had suggested to you is I really suggest you go back and look at the set of slides that Harlan did for the March meeting because he put a lot of work into clarifying what he was trying to accomplish at that point in time okay so that explanation needs to be distilled into the next draft of the doctor right okay so um so is there anything else on this topic what do we need to do to move them forward or turn them into working group documents or something so the the NTP draft an NTP extension fields we\u0027re going to do a call for adoption on the mailing list and we\u0027re going to take a look at as part of that call for adoption philip\u0027s the comments Philip sent out today and any other additional comments that come in so that\u0027s the status of that one the other four need to be updated if we want to progress them now sooner is better I suppose then yeah they need to be made compliant with 78 22 so how about if we turn them into working group documents sooner and you\u0027re going to have those changes I talked about soon I\u0027m really okay for years I can I can it if if you\u0027re telling me you\u0027re willing to take the strategy I said then I\u0027m willing to turn them into working group documents i will actually by the way i will apologize to the working group because i have caused a bit of confusion I\u0027ll have to admit I started chairing this working group before data tracker existed and sometimes I\u0027m not really good at at setting the status and data tracker because I don\u0027t look at it that I don\u0027t look at the status very often it turns out that other people do look at the status and they consider it very important and earlier this week I caused a lot of confusion because I marked the document as a candidate for working group adoption I did that because the file name was named in such a way that it wasn\u0027t showing up in the ntp part of the data tracker because ntp wasn\u0027t in the file name that didn\u0027t mean that it was a candidate for adoption above all "

    "text": "of these other documents that were sitting there it just meant that I wanted it to show up in the right place and data tracker so I will mark all of these as candidates for adoption Harlan and we can do a quick working group call for adoption on them thank you very much so and I\u0027ll try and do a better job of paint staying on top of data tracker um so that\u0027s what happens when you processes and tools change and you don\u0027t alright so that brings us to 1153 look at that any other business if we\u0027ve got the time I\u0027d like to give a quick chat about the three proposals I submitted that I was hoping we would have a demo for in the hackathon about secure Network time is a better alternative to NTS you can have three minutes and I want the last two minutes to wrap up okay the three proposals I submitted do two things one provide a means for ntp TCP services which is a general mechanism to communicate with ntp between with ntp in a way that is not limited by UDP packet sizes and and the ntp rate limits it includes a key exchange sub proposal the whole reason for which was already was simultaneously mentioned by the nice folks from that nod having to do a separating key exchange from the ntp server the other proposal there is secure network time which basically builds on the top-down architecture of ntp that says there\u0027s a black box between two ntp processes that does key exchange and one of those is the symmetric key file auto key was another one and the other proposals do very similar things the point being is if we can agree on a key ID and private you know and opaque data whether that Mac or H Mac or any other sort of thing gets deployed as a legacy Mac or as a Mac in an EF it just builds on it and life gets easier and then that result of this is secure network time out of the gate will support client-server symmetric mode many caste and multicast and that in a nutshell is what these proposals were for and I apologized that we were unable to come up with a working demo by the end of the weekend but we\u0027re supposed to be very very close on that I\u0027m done ok thank you just just for the the well actually I said this on the mailing list so I guess it doesn\u0027t really matter but the the the proposals are obviously "
