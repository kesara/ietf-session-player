Because it does govern how your activities in the Are part of the process. Go to conduct. This again should be very familiar. And not a big challenge for folks at especially at this point in the week. Thank you for observing it. Couple more meeting tips that the chairs were asked to make sure the room had heard. The session is being recorded. For in person participants, make sure to sign in the session using Media, from the data tracker agenda, use me to join the mic queue it's especially appreciated if you can do that because that helps us manage between the virtual... The virtual and physical cues. Keep your audio on video off if not. Using the on version. And please wear masks unless actively speaking on a microphone. Remote participants we're glad you here, make sure your audio and video are off unless you're sharing or presenting during the session. Use of a headset is strongly recommended. Yep. So our agenda.

Okay. Terrific. Sounds. So thanks. Susan and thanks ben out Thanks so.

But somewhat related since it's name us, not the domain name system. Next, So as you all know, dna Censorship is widespread, Dns as part of the massive surveillance apparatus, and we also have injection text, The working group has in the last decade, spend a lot of work on things like dns dns and so on, as as you all know, to defend against some of these attacks. But the system is another attempt to doing is some more radical redesign, Next. The group my system is decentralized, with secure memorable names. Just like Dns, you can use delegation to delegate resolution to another zone For example if you have, you know, W example of uni dot alt, looks like a Dns name, and you could have the... Whatever G s out. There's is only example in there. And then that could delegate to zone W w or to a record. In our configuration, you would then typically put for any zone the respective public key of the authority that would sign the records in that zone, and that's kind of you start the resolution process is by configuring for any kind of domain that you want what the public key is supposed to be. Next. So the key features of Dns as first of all it's compatible. Compatible with Dms. So you could use it as a drop in replacement and resolve Dns names using G. The key feature is that you get clearly and response privacy. So if somebody asked the question in Gm, the zone public key, nor the label. Become public knowledge. The servers answering those queries"

And I do not nor but the answer was so the record can remain secret between the zone publisher and the person the name resolution, Of course, under the assumption that the zone or the label remains secret as well. Because of course, if you can ask the same question, you should get the same answer. We also have a globally instant and reliable key replication increment in the system and we can support dane records, so basically, you can also serve as a P. Next? So current status, we have a draft. On the independent stream editor track, we have passed there. We're now in the I conflict revenue for a while. Not... Well, in part because was a difficult one I'm here, but in part also because waiting for the dot alt draft to we have two different implementations in C. We've done the usability started that basically shows the users wouldn't even know that they're using G over Dns and we have a way to migrate Dns zones into G automatically and we run this on large zones like dot f r o dot s e that we have public access to. You can install the software and run it if you have appropriate free software distribution. Next, Okay. So as we can resolve, Dns names in Gm, you know, there's, of course, this possibility of having a conflict. The dot Ultra tries to address this challenge. It doesn't specify a registry for out. Which I personally think as a mistake. The net project once the Ghana registry where we are putting in registry for that, so you're welcome to come to us if you want to have your own protocol under dot, and we will be happy to run such a registry. Think it would be good to put that into that out. Draft. But okay."

Users don't have to stick to G not out, they could put any domain in there and resolve names in that domain over the glue name system, and it's actually okay. For example, if you had somebody who was publishing dot l I or dot a new under the new name system? As an alternative way to access those zones, you might want to say okay. I want to override Dns here for this zone I do not want to use Dns. I want to use Dns and that's okay. But in cases where you don't want the conflict, then got out is useful, for user to use, and of course, then we recommend that. Next? Okay. So to conclude, premium system proposes radical alternative for the Business protocol We have specifications and implementations and migration logic. The dot alt draft will help address conflicts where they would be a problem for the users And we have a draft for the D that's used below if you're interested in the developments on that specification.

This is conflicts directly with work in the Etf and should not be published. And those are sort of the main overview of the positions. There is some Nuance So just to everyone knows, my position is because, you know, we've worked with the authors and the Is to make it so that this won't conflict directly because of the suggestion to use.

So greatly appreciate you guys of willingness to adapt to that. Second thank you for all the cool technology that is in, you know, this. I've said this before, you know, I read the the they're gonna gain a specification before, and there's a lot of quote map that, you know, I think it's pretty novel and, you know, will help even even if it's not used in the future, which I hope it is, but even if it's not,"

One one final point though is that everybody been concentrating on the naming conflicts at this point, you know, especially with respect Tl and things like that. There's other conflicts in the document that I've marked up written document that conflicts with the Dns protocol another way. For example, you're reusing our types but you have a larger field. So you've essentially coop opted the rest of the numeric values beyond the existing Etf specifications. So nothing is good or bad. Right. But if the Atf was ever going to try to expand, and then you were using those numeric fields beyond the Ihs current range rather than sticking to the for your own youth section. You're you're using a significant expanded set of fields that could be a conflict that people wanna to explore as well. Yeah. I mean, we deliberately said, okay, the current Dns protocol only allows the sixteen bits and I seem to be enough for the foreseeable future so we didn't see a reason why dns would expand it. And so we use the thirty to bit space to avoid record type instead lower ones are the ones of Dns, and we're gonna stick to that and we only use those above two to the sixteen, in the hope that this would not generate conflicts. Now we have the Ghana registry by our time will be registered And of course, if the In the future were decide that they need for some for inc reason more than two to the sixteen record types. We might just combine the two to avoid conflicts on that level as well, I think. George Ai panic.

Who is ad duplicating these delegation question Well, I went to this working group about ten years ago and we said we have a bunch of use top level domains like dot onion, which was effectively passed dot on that were not. And the goal was to avoid conflict Was the Dns name span as we just charge. A unified name space is beneficial for user slightly beneficial, highly been probably beneficial.

Then the best way of doing know, this allocation is to basically say, okay, This is actually a real implementation effort an actual protocol design that deserves to have a unique suffix, so to speak. And that's the only education we're gonna do is, you know, first come served on somebody who implements a new name system. And I think that's again beneficial to users that want to have this conflict of avoidance, which for me is the main motivation behind that alt. Yeah. And not this... We need something completely unstructured wild west where users will not have this common expectation of names not having conflict. No. I think I think by motivation, you are in a very similar head space to many people. The problem being that we have structural behaviors around the creation not these entities.

And added a registry for feature supplier codes to be added well. Next slide. as Yes. So what we have done is we have map these server codes to the error quotes that are already defined in R c nine one four. So basically, all these error codes map back to where blocked sensor or filter. And we had a a good discussion internally on why is because they need to use four answer and we thought it was not required Next slide is that should given expressions. What we thought was before johnson basically is forging the response and the client is losing the deals error response which is blocked sensor dot filter, which gives additional meaning to these sub codes.

But let's say we add more fields here. That potentially could super needing contact index format. And so I'm just a little bit concerned about being mandatory that you have to come up with some telephone number or email address. You know, for example, there are cases today where we allow a Dns configuration to be installed by an application that can I wanna configure dis encrypted Dns service from my whole device that does this filtering In that case, there may be like, we may know better remediation or contact info of, like, switch to the app on your phone that provided this, and that's where you do it and we don't or we need a telephone number an email address there?

That makes sense to me in fact, if you see that feel that we have defined, we don't in fact define what what should be there in that, but we give suggestions like it could uri or a telephone format or something else. Because we would not show what all the content mechanisms that could be there. So we could just give examples on how we would look like. So you're not migrating on whether it should be adjusted telephone number or a six. So They're just just just examples that recorded there if my memory so right. My impression is that it that I you do need to include some value for this c contact entry and it does need to be a list of eyes. Okay. So I'm just worried that that may be a little bit too narrow.

Thank you. Wes. You were in the queue? Thank you. With Frederick Isi and one of the authors of the E Rf, So this makes me super happy. To actually see this type of deployment. A couple of questions, you know, one I think the is the web is not the only environment. So you're not combining this with like, address redirection or things like that where you're spoof responses that don't exist you're only returning E codes for real data that would exist. So the actual return code is as you saw an next domain. So we wanna... When we wanna block stuff, we don't want people to go there. So it's... I mean, in the old days as K, we would have returned an Ip address of a web server. These days we only do An domain and then the actual webpage that presents the block pitch is an. Okay. And what happens with supplemental content, like images or Javascript or Css. Well, these are all kind of different dns requests. Right? That it depends on the list that you have that for for blocking. You but you could have a main page that's okay. With content from another name that you are blocking. And so what is the Ui do in that case? Where the main page, you know, domain is fine and you're requesting Css from malicious dot com. That you didn't even no longer use because it's being blocked. You can't show the error code as well. Right? You probably. You have to show it in the small window that you get for that. Yeah. I guess."

So that's the reason if you see most of their quotes are pretty much standard ones so that the application itself would display the appropriate message back to the user without any images or or any javascript or anything like that? It's plain old simple messaging to know why court blocked.

So for example, you know, a great example is Acne, which has a Dns based challenge. For a user to prove that they control a particular domain. And hence they should be issued a certificate for it. So And yeah. And previously we had just survey where we talked about text and cd. And then with the Bc, we said, okay. So it's it seemed like text was just the right way to do it and see they might lead to issues. But if we did get some feedback that maybe we should still keep seeing him, but not recommended.

So would this makes sense, even though this is not something that for example, acne does right now, but be up this as a as an option that you, you know, if you really care about his putting everything and being extremely clear, then you should do this. Or you could also say that it should never expire which is... And but you if you're doing that, then you should say that and not just kinda hope that no one's gonna remove the record and then stuff breaks. And yeah.

Next slide, please? So today I'm talking about a new draft which describes method to do authenticated denial Dns sec, which has been around for a while. It was originally devised by cloudflare, and described in a now expired Internet drive from two thousand sixteen. That time, it was called Black lives, So we've since renamed it to just compact denial of existence. Or contact compact answers if you prefer something more. It is widely deployed amongst a set of commercial online signer today in the industry? Notably cloudflare and a one on Amazon route fifty three. And one of its distinguishing and controversial features is that it eliminates an ex domain responses completely. Or at least the traditional conception that next domain. And that as you might expect has some operational occasions next slide, please. Alright. So what this does is for names that don't exist it... These implementations pretend that it does exist it just doesn't have any resource records for the type you for. So in other words, it returns a rather than an an ex domain response, a no data answer. And crucially, in that answer is a dynamically generated and signed ans record with proof of the note data. And the stated rationale stated benefit for this game is we get more compact answers, so signed no data response requires just one ns record and it's corresponding our sig"

There's more computation and increase in the size of response. So there's another reason which I sometimes forget, but Christian reminded me of recently that a lot of these implementations For whatever reason you can debate whether this is a good idea or not, but they have challenges understanding the tree structure of the Dns cell. So for an Annex domain response, what you need to do is you need to find the ancestor of the name that didn't exist to compute close because so that you can generate the proof that a wild couldn't have generated the answer. Right? So that's a concern. Can have a debate about whether that's the correct way to implement a dns zone. I don't think this is the right way. To do that right place to do that. There are lots of these implementations out there in the industry. Many companies. So next slide please. Alright. So what are the operational implications of the scheme? For typical end user applications, probably nothing. In most cases a no data responses is we almost identically to an annex domain. There are... However, a no data results can result in additional follow on queries for additional types of the same name. And this actually has been observed and it does happen because if you think of the common case the dual stack host, the common Dns query pattern is a quad a followed by an. So if the quality didn't exist, an Annex domain would have immediately suppressed follow query words In this case, it will generate those additional queries."

Now arguably, We could say that in the age of Dns sec you you can't trust the response code because it is una authenticated and can be spoof. Right? But If that's the case, then what we have to do is infer exist the non existence of a name by looking deeper into the packet sign data record specifically, the record and the question is, can we reliably infer the non existence of a name from that. So next slide, please. And the quick answer is is a problem because it turns out as the spec is currently written, you is no way to distinguish an domain from mt non terminal names because share the exact same type thing map. There are some implementations out there that kind of hack around this with a workaround by for empty non terminal responses, they basically display a wide type map which which is composed of every record that is accept the name that you que for. But this has other implications because then you've lost distinguish ability of empty terminals, you potentially bloated the size of the type map you could potentially confuse tools that do type inference from the type map. So this is essentially a hack and we want a cleaner solution not a hat. So next slide, please. Alright. So what can we do to fix the situation? So essentially what we need to do we need to introduce distinguish a protocol element in the response Either for an extra domain, or for mt non terminals.

The p we're proposing for this is N name, which stands for non existent name and we deliberately chose not to use N domain just to avoid any confusion with the response code ne of the same name. Our plan is to use the lowest available R type the meta type range. And last I checked one twenty eight is still available. And very recently, cloudflare flare. I think maybe a week or two weeks ago, but Christian can probably tell you exactly that cloudflare has recently done a preliminary orientation to the scheme.

So what about the question of risk storing and in the field itself, which a lot of people really want to happen. And that's a little bit more challenging for various reasons. But it turns out we may have to try to do this at least make our best effort it because as I mentioned previously, There are tons of tools that only know how to examine the code. And they are currently broken in the face of these mechanisms. In theory, you could work with the developers of those tools to enhance them. To instead of looking at the Arc code to look... Recognize the Annex domain and n name signal in the response. But the question is ever happen, how much work is involved in doing that. On the resolve side, we could for non validating queries at least. A resolve that recognizes Domain could substitute the Are in back into the r code in responses and we realized back to those query. But I think we really need to have a solution for validating queries as well. Things that send equals one. And the related question is is there a way to put the domain r code back into the response that is generated from the server itself, that's more challenging. And I think the only way I know at least to do that is by implementing new Signaling with its complexity cost, I think I received some pushback about it, but at least we should think through that option.

Stuff used for automatic as management for key overs, dns good bootstrapping, stuff like that. And if things go wrong, it has a potential security impact, so we should think about whether that standard resolution is the correct way. Then the season specification little different it actually advocates limiting queries just one authoritative explorer, so it has to say explicitly on the cd spec. There's also a suggestion this back for you sync that says that you can ask of the name servers if you want, and then do some serial comparisons. Not because of consistency, but because of rec, And Yeah. So similar supply. Right? It's used for dedication updates, name server and two updates. And it might have potential security impact.

I've talked about this last time, so I'm moved to the backup if if you wanna take a look at that, the main takeaway was that each name operator is a single point of failure and can break obligations accidentally or and that is not what probably would expect Next slide. There's also a new failure model not new, but it occurred to me. So I a paper by Casey coffee that is about an Ep quirk that sometimes prevents the removal of expired names several names then you can hijack at least part of the name of the Dns traffic if you manage to register that by name, traffic query traffic you can send whatever responses you like, and you would think cool, the does of integrity protection against stand. So that opening him so wouldn't have any say. As you know, about ninety percent of the domain to actually used And as long as that isn't bit more. Let's see what could be tech vector here. So I assume you have a men with an expired name server, and then there are some other legitimate name service still and operation. And now the hijack I'll just stage one so to speak and they published their own I'm keys Associated see his key records. If the parent happens to process that. Then their the the attacker keys will end up in the ds record set. And we'll prevent the legitimate responses of the remaining authoritative name service to be accepted by validating with service and they're able become focused. So this breaks the availability of the legitimate name service. You'll know in the delegation. Then even worse once you have that, the hijack can publish and updated and s could set on there. Seven which is the only one whose answers will be validated."

    "text": "And also publish see. And then that way, out from the delegation, names so record said. For the legitimate remaining authoritative name service, which finally breaks integrity of the whole thing. That is exactly the opposite of what he would want. Because the Legitimate names to have no presence anymore Don't. The attackers is in position where they seem to be the only legitimate party providing service for that domain. So you could say that's kind of a constructed problem, but it is a way that could be followed. And in the ten years where the study was done sorry for for the make data sample period. In the paper where It was investigated how frequent that kind of risk is we turned out that a few hundred thousand domains are exposed to the risk in about one third we're taken over which doesn't mean that each of them targeted, maybe was just a few names service, and they were hosting many domains. But it's not negligible but I would think. And yeah. So the draft essentially proposes that couldn't happen if you would check that the Cbs records are consistent across name service. When you do the processing as a parent. And the only thing it requires is that you just ask each of them individually. Next slide? So this is actually the last slide. So the update since last Meeting are very minor. So the basics essentially are the same when you process record types let's start with a c. As a parent then you must ensure that they are consistent across authoritative name service. And if one doesn't respond, that's fine. And you just skip over it, but it can't be that you get responses whose contents are inconsistent. I think Victor proposed to add an option of retry mechanism with financial back for resolving inconsistencies."

    "startTime": "01:30:00",
    "text": "So I added that. And there's also minor editorial changes plus the added motivation that just talked about with a litigation hijacking. Now one thing that occurred to me is that the Cvs specification says that when new process that stuff. You must insure that the Test records set would not break validation. Now that could also happen if you processes see record set and for example, replace the name service in the delegation it could be that for example, they don't have the property in excuse and their zone or whatever like, the the wrong ars algorithms and there's currently no provision that you have to ensure that sis updates don't validation. Although season does require dns. So Just occurred to me that that could be a thing that perhaps can be added to that consistency requirements document if the working group feels that makes sense. And that's actually, is the next question what be reason the next steps. I think some people provided feedback already and last year sometime it further was some discussion on the list about it. So there seems to be some interest I haven't heard much negative feedback so far. In fact, not in topic at all. And I just wondered if working things that should be something that should be generally recommended And in other words perhaps adopted and then published some sometimes. That's all I god. Thank you, Peter. Under any comments from the room? Yeah. Okay. Victor is cute. Please go ahead victor. Wanted to mention corner case or c if somebody is willingly giving up a domain transferring it to another party, and the other party doesn't want to do dns but target name servers."

Can't work. No. We don't necessarily need to make that possible but it's one corner case to at least. Consider. Whether it's in scope or not. Yeah. I think one way to address this is that when processing Cds we could consider ignoring. So your opinion would be interesting, actually. We could consider ignoring any insecure responses we gaps and treat them like, unresponsive name server. And that would allow even when for some reason the new provider that doesn't have dns a sec. Isn't in the name center records already it would allow the old one to publish another Cvs record to turn off dns. So that could be them. But I don't know if that's the best way. Johan yes. This is your one stand time. So I I have two objections. Objection number one is that we spent perhaps fifteen years explaining to the world that if you have something that is signed by dns can validates, then it's good. And this sort of breaks that logic by saying except when it's really important. If it's really important sunday, we have to talk to all authority names service just to verify whether they are actually agreeing or not. And I I think that could have bad implications over time saying if it's really important, don't trust the Dns signature. Talk to all the authoritative servers because someone else"

The other reason why I don't like this. It's because The authoritative servers are really proxies for the zone owner. There are proxies for the red. They are assumed to publish information that already once published. If they don't, as if they disagree or if it's out of sync or whatever. This is more of a reflection on a potential business issue of potential choice of a bad provider a potential disagreement between multiple providers or whatever. All of these are non Dns protocol issues. They are business issues. And I don't think we should add complexity to Gm s. To deal. With what is essentially not. Multiple issues, but rather business issues. Thank you. I'm going directly to Wes. So we can take this points also to the mailing list for further discussion. West Frederick Isi and author of the c document. It was ten years ago, and and I think I originally wanted to query all the name servers not because of getting, you know, different answers, but rather to make sure that we always had the most recent version of something from an Sla perspective. But I lost that ballet while I think at the time, and I don't remember why but the important thing is that The decisions that were made were about the robustness of keeping the Dns up and running.

The the c and Cds documents can't fix that fundamental, you know, misconception of of the upward hierarchy, you know, not dealing with things appropriately. I look forward to the discussion about this in the future though. I'm not sure where we should take Thank you. Then I sorry. Yeah. Before closing, you have... Well, you can conclude this this your presentation. Okay. So in principle, I I fully agree that it's a goal of Dns that you only have to ask one and you know, verify one of trust. But I think precisely to to guarantee that that property is a property. You have to make sure that the chain of trust doesn't break for x than to reasons like one provider messing up the provider change. And I do recommend to look at the two backup slides when you have time and see how things can go wrong really easily. In a way that exactly goes the opposite direction that I think people should expect to happen. And then very quickly. The second thing there's very precedence for that, not specifically for what I'm proposing, but for cases where you don't just it. As one question validated as said for the seas Says you may ask all of them. So that is already something that hasn't sent a very bad signal as the as afraid of that people will be doing it all the time. And second the Cbs for example, says, you have to sign and check the cvs s record is signed with a k k and not with the Z for example, so there's also deviation from treating everything the same it also has a cost. Side issues of people wanting more case. I think those both fears are. I'm very happy to take it to the list. Thank you. Okay. We're running short time as I already said. Next presentation is Johan."

Next slide, please. So this is about work that Peter I did following the last ninety one in London. And the The starting point for this is, the problems statement so is that scanning is costly. And we have a growing number of scanning things in Dns now. We have Cvs scanning, and we have seizing scanning. And we have things that are slowing down convergence of the Dns hierarchy at the rather high cost. Or in some cases extremely high cost. Then we also have because both peter and I work on on the multi sign of things, we we have another case where this is a bit of problem with scanning because we have in the multi sinai case, a need to keep... Keep keys in sync. Across multiple signer. And if they are not in sync, we open up for... Well, for broken signature shane, which will cause problems. So that's another point where scanning comes into play and perhaps we really need very, very frequent scanning, which is obviously not a good design choice. Next slide, please. So then we got to think Are there any Is there any prior? Anything we could look for for guidance. And Obviously, there is. We have notify. We have Rf nineteen ninety six which says that"

It's just that today, we only use it for for with an S a in it. Because we haven't found a use case for any other thing. But now we do have those use cases. So what we are suggesting is notify Cvs. To inform the parent that the child has published and new yes. And notify c to inform the parent that the child has published new season. Next slide please. But where should we send them? Well, in the... In... Because this is sort of vertical notification rather than the traditional notify, which is sort of sideways from the primary to the secondary. We need to figure out where to send it and we obviously know where the parent is. So let's ask the parent. So our proposal is to send the notification to a destination announced by the parent."

We also add a scheme parameter The reason why we add the scheme parameter is because of concerns that perhaps there may be other needs for how to locate where to send the notification. In spite of us only defining one such. Mechanism. Next slide, please. And then we get to this slightly more complicated case, which is what we need for multi signer. And the multi sinai case, we have more than one signer. And when you have more than one signer that each generated own keys, we need to basically cross feed the case between sinus, the the public keys that is. So that each signer signs a complete r set with all the keys so that regardless where from you got to case, they will be signed by the chain that you're following. But designers today as in authoritative names or or other types designers. They roll their keys automatically. And they basically don't inform anyone because for instance, rolling your in case is considered to be a completely internal operation. No need to inform anyone in advance. And that's sort of true if you're the only signer. But it immediately breaks down if you're not And in the multi sinai case, you're not. So we need to have information about"

Central synchronizing more stuff? Next slide. Done. Next slide. Nice picture. You can look at the mouth. And if we don't keep this in saying pile things happen. Next slide. Next slide. So here we have the proposal to add a third new type of notification, which is to notify dns key. And a problem with the note of dns key is obviously that Well, we need it. But it shouldn't be sent to the parent because the parent basically doesn't care. It should be sent so that it's available to other signer or to the infrastructure that is keeping signing in sync in in a multi sign context. Next slide, please. And here we have the result with red arrows being the notifications. So was assuming that the designers actually send notifications to a multi sign controller that's the music thing at the bottom.

And we cannot send them to the parent because parent doesn't care. It's obviously the child of cares. And our proposal here is to use the same and mechanism an as we use in Cds and cnc in case and look it up in the child's so instead. The same new r type to notify our type. And again, look for where to send the notification. We have the same format, the same scheme parameter. We only use this first scheme equals one, here in what we define. Most simple mechanism. But we leave it open for the future to define possible other making and it should such makes become needed. Thanks time, please. So What about the triple r model? Well, in the triple r model, in most cases, there is no issue. I mean, for instance, make many cc these and other tl, they already do this type of scanning and they do update the parents shown based on what they find as they find a Cds for instance. And then they inform the registrar through Ep notifications somehow on register cabin keeps in track. Should that not be possible in some context. I don't know.

Well, I think one of the best things or Nineteen ninety six is that it doesn't impact security. Because it doesn't say anything of whether to trust the hint that the notification is. It only says it could be a good thing doing whatever verification we intend to do god about now. So we we keep the security model of whatever the scanner is doing. We're just telling the scanner do it now, rather than tomorrow. And thereby, we improved service to the client and we prove coherent and say this in the system. So The security model is really not a difficult issue here. The the last point I I want to make is that it's important to be aware that The difference between Ninety six notifications. What I call notify s. Is that notify s. Something that is sent in the Dns protocol between name servers. This is still Dns protocol but it's not sent between name servers. It's sent to a service. The recipient of these notifications is typically some sort of scanner service or similar or in the design case. It's a multi sign controller thing. It's not a name server. Just to point that out.
