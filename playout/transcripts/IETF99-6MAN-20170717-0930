    "text": "the the mailing list ah the ipv6 link a local prefix according to the specs is fe80 colon colon slash 10 but RFC 42 91 link local address configuration assumes on colon slash 64 therefore the embedded prefix length is restricted to slash 64 but what if we could use a shorter fe80 zero of prefix for example if we had fe80 colon colon slash 10 and embedded the 2001 DBA we would have this lawn looking clean here that starts at the tenth bit then beds the 2001 address in the tenth bed the pros of that there are no wasted bits and you can embed prefixes up 2/1 18 the cons is that\u0027s not easy to read or parse and when I say parse I mean looking at the address and programmatically looking at the words of the one hand 28 that address another alternatives that we could use the prefix fe80 calling 1/16 and then we can embed the 2001 DBA starting in the 17th bit so that I prints nicely the pros are that it reads well and it can embed prefixes up to a / 112 cons is that waste 6 bits of the leading 16 bits use cases and next steps use cases would be enterprise mobile devices like cell phones and tablets and so forth aeronautical communications for airplanes to talk to air traffic controllers unmanned the air system networks for vehicle to be able to communications and home networks with multiple subnets such as whole net I I want to ask the sixth working question at this time but I\u0027d like to get some questions if we can fit them in the next minute Thank You Fred any one comment or two on that if not then can you please send the blue shades forward we\u0027ll continue the discussion on the list Fred thank you we will print throughout the lease comment on what we should do with the with the draft documents I think we\u0027ll take that to the list I think it\u0027s pretty clear that we\u0027ll keep addressing architecture park if anyone volunteers to do the changes necessary to privacy extensions please let us know on the list yes and then we have to work through the other ones but I think apart from that we\u0027ll talk on the list never mention the word 64 again on the list or at least not for the next three months please and see you in Singapore good thank you very much "
