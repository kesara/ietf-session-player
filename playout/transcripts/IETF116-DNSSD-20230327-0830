If you've got anything else, you want you you can contact the chairs to get yours added into the repo. So this is our agenda. We first of all want to talk about S sop and update lease. Then move want the added advertising proxy. Nate will be presenting multi stream discovery. And then we cover S sop replication and time received. Was there any requests to change this agenda? If not will carry on? So This working group has been working as you know, for a long time on S sr. Which uses update lease. We had working group last calls for both of those. They completed...

So the Documents been around for time. It's actually in version nineteen today. There was one comment... The reason for that there was one comment there was I had early review from Amanda, and she pointed out that we lack a domain name reservations duration section, which didn't intend to lack, but The problem was the title wasn't right, and I referred to Rs c sixty seven sixty one, when I mentor ferrari E c eighty three seventy sixty seven sixty one is the document places the requirement, eighty three seventy five is the one that has the text that I wanted to to vi. And the goal is just to have avoid res getting the text in c eighty two seventy five, which is like a page and a half. So next slide, So this is the change. I don't know if people can read it. Hopefully, got a big screen error. Can read it on my screen. But basically, it just adds a note to the Rs editor saying please the note before publication and no time. Am explaining what we're doing here just in case not clear. Because amanda asked me to add that.

So the change that update least is really simple Es pointed out. During the last call that the text about four eight five formats for the update lease option was not particularly generous in terms of how thoroughly it describe what what the behavior of things ought to be. So I changed it from one paragraph, two paragraphs of and I think the text is a little clearer now sort of addresses the confusion that Is experiencing reading text.

And so we we were trying to figure out how to talk about this and we didn't really... I I posed a question of the working nobody seemed to have particularly good answer. So Next slide. As it consequence, we're stuck in scope creek, which is that, you know, originally, we were just gonna say, okay, Appetizer proxy. You've got this database of stuff, you're gonna advertise it using an hit in the story. But without context, it didn't make whole lot of sense and so we started adding information about, like, house Sr works with it and how you know, interacts with general resolve or functionality because got an Sr server that's on port fifty three. So anyway. The result of this is that the the document got a little bit bigger as we started to address that and then we got into this scope creek place where he wasn't sure where we weren't sure what to do. So the question is, like, obviously, we need to talk about all the up. But is this the right place to do it next slide? So having gotten no particular advice for the working group on this last time This time when I was sitting now thinking about what to do next I thought, you know, maybe we should like, this is the the the problem we always have with with big documents is well, we should with the document But I think it actually makes a little bit of sense in this case, because if we do it bite nice chunks were more likely to actually finish instead of winding up with another for your was it five year one document publication cycle. Because I think we could probably publish advertising proxy like you know, before we're at least at you know, the the the San Francisco Etf, if we weren't trying to do all of these other things as well."

    "text": "So the idea maybe we should have some combination of this set of documents something talking about. Obviously, advertising proxy is just like you've got a database advertising the content is that database is be. And then Like, the the... What happens with port fifty three I mean, I could go go over the the detailed slides, but there's basically the Uni cast service, which is four fifty three there's how to host active Uni cast service There's maybe how do we plumb things so the cast service works on a stub network. And then there's how do we plug pulling things so that the Uni cas service works on home network with a Cd router that supports it. And possibly how that interacts with the routers that supported. So that's what I think needs to get done. Whether that needs to be forwarded dot I don't know. But I think those are the four topics. So next slide. So basically, the Unit cast service is just like, you know, everything it happens on port fifty three. Probably talks about the advertising need to describe it on a protocol level The context of it is it's probably a c router. Could got a stub out etcetera. So this should be... You know, we already basically know the answers to all of these questions. So radio dot much should easy. Next slide. And then the rest... The... How the host behaves seems like it's a little bit more of a guard because, like, one of the things we might wanna do is actually have Uni cast dns see as a whole be used as a discovery mechanism it is an instead of dns. So, like, how does that look that's another document. I'm not gonna go into detail on this is only up seven minutes, which probably already used. Next slide, And then, you know, stub out basically, like, okay. You wanna set this up on a stub hour or how do you plummet it? How you advertise it"

This is kinda of edging into home got territory. But since that one where the mill exists, there's a territory. So that's basically I think the remaining topics that we were trying to scoop into the advertising proxy document and perhaps you could see why that wasn't working. So that's all I had to say about it. I think there meant might be a Next slide, but story. Yep. Good. Sorry. So I think you're write ted that the supporting documents would be really helpful. Thank you for volunteering to write them. I know you're super busy already. I will do what I can to help with that. But also throughout the invitation to the rest of the room.

Anyone have other questions, comments, mu, I'm just honoring that about the name discussion we have. So if you keep advertising proxy to its original more limited scope, so you think we can keep that name also. Yeah. I think I think that makes that question kind of go away because I mean, there is still the question of I started calling this Uni cast Dns ssd service, I think. It Yeah. And that feels like it's It's a little bit generic and it felt uncomfortable when it was the advertising proxy, but now that it's not the advertising proxy. I think it's okay. No. Okay. Thanks.

I'm with Garmin in the National Marine Electronics Association part of the one that committee. Next slide. Just check with the audio level. Okay. Could not sure I take the mic off the stand, and I we can speak directly into it. Or a little client. Yeah. That's easy that one. That's better. Yeah. Okay. So I want talk a little bit about Marine networks which churn may different than what Most folks are used to working with. So is kind of an example diagram here where we'll have a couple of displays and couple different types of sensors is there. They may contain different sensors of a given class like radar sonar our environmental sensors like temperature, engine sensors, any number of different things. What we want on these networks is we do not want a central point of failure on there. So We don't run a Dhcp server rely entirely on Slack to do link local on that. And then also our user usually just expect, plug and play operations. So we don't have and installer that can come in and configure everything typically. And and even if we did the amount of knowledge about Ip six fairly limited in the in the industry so far. So there's kind two parts of this. There's there's another document that's working through the him working group, and that goes into... How do we assign Ip addresses, multi cast Ip... Addresses, to the different streams that we have. That are being transmitted from the radar on our devices, etcetera. And then the second part of that is once we do have those,"

    "startTime": "00:24:00",
    "text": "how do we advertise the streams themselves so that the displays can figure out what they want to to display and and which addresses that they want subscribe to. So there's some more detail on that. Presented that in the pam working group this morning so you can check out the Youtube do video on that if you're interested or come up and talk to me afterwards. So next slide. So the proposal here is called Dns based multi discovery. And the idea is that the networks they use a method to dynamically allocate the multi addresses. And then like Dns is is d, this This uses P sr and T records to describe the service. The there's a new special use domain called in cast dot Arp that we're proposing. And that is used in the a and quad records to indicate that the host name is mapped to a multi cast stream. And so this is kind of the the idea we wanna populate with this is that to our knowledge, traditionally, the A and q records are meant for uni cast addresses only, and that this would be for a multi cast address. Using that Cast Arp. Now. Based off of some comments from Ted on the the version of the document. I updated a a second version last night that changed this, It used to be just a dot in cast and out dot amc arp. But it also points out that networks with their domain could potentially publish a and q a records for their own assigned multi pass addresses. So there's nothing in this limits it to a local multi cast, domain area there. Next slide? So the the other thing that the document list some of requirements that are and then"

    "startTime": "00:26:03",
    "text": "some cases are somewhat obvious that with the multi cast you would need to have Udp, so the second label and the service portion of that services name has to be underscore Udp. And then unlike traditional dns ssd which can use fm ep or dynamic ports for the services that they're offering. Multi cast has to be use some sort of pre agreed port. Typically, you might get a assignment from My on that, or I think what happens often in the case of kinda self design networks is that you would just agree to some sort of multi cast port possibly any similar range. So either one is acceptable according to the the draft that we currently have there. But it does point out that the P for reverse must reflect the chosen multi cast address. So We'll see that in an example on the next slide. So in this example, we have the Ethernet Mac address, and that's used to generate a link local address using the Slack mechanism. And from that, it creates a Link scoped Ip v six multi cast address. I think that's R c four four eight nine that talks about that. And then that's what it uses to transmit with. And then it's got just example. Host name of example, and then it's just got just a generic heartbeat service called Heartbeat udp. And service instance of that is instance. So that's kinda lists out the records that are advertised there. The highlighted line there, that's from the the zero document that I described from the the Pin working group. So we'll just kinda skip over that right now. But looking at the other records here, you have the Harp Udp Pt record, and that's how you would discover that there's an instance?"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:28:02",
    "text": "Of the heartbeat there. And then you have the Sr record that advertisers that it's at port sixty two thousand. And the host name of instant dot example dot in cast dot Arp. So any application looking this up would notice the Mca cast arthur there. Typically it would know that it's looking for a multi cast stream anyway, but this kinda solidifies that fact In this case, there's also a text record there that's empty. But then if you'd look down to the quad record there, you've got the Ip six Multi katz address advertised, in that quad record, and then there's a reverse lookup record there as well. And the way those works is it takes each n of the address and puts them in in reverse with the the content of that P record being the the host name for looking that up. In this case, an instance that example that in cast dot arp. Next slide. So that's basically it. Any questions? Ted go go. Thing, I absolutely want support it.

So it was not a waste of time, but we did not actually get a finish line. We learned a lot. It was me, Apt lynn wins Apple engineer apps works for Google, We sat down in a conference room at Apple Park and set stuff up and fumble around for a while. Turned out a big problem that we sort of wrestled with during this particular inter intro was like, actually the service discovery, you know, not perhaps surprisingly, getting dns to do what we wanted became a topic. I mean, it is surprising in a sense. It should just work. But we're kind of being clever about how we're using the dns Ns to start up the protocol. So there was just a bunch of that kind of stuff that we had to deal with to get to the point where we could exchange packets. And then once we got that working, we found that there were some issues as a transport layer. And so we spent a bunch of time figuring that out. And bottom line is ran at of time. Had some really good discussions. We didn't actually succeeded exchanging any protocol packets. Next slide? So the service discovery stuff. This is something we've been noticing also in in live testing a service every stuff is non trivial getting it right because we're we're doing with the the Replication protocol we're doing some fairly like fashion forward stuff. And we use the the service discovery advertisement is a way for for the Sr servers to run with each other. And making that work turns out to be You know, it's not like super hard, but we just have to really think think it's carefully and we did a fair amount of that discussion during the inter interrupt and I have some notes about that that you'll see later. So next slide, So some issues. So these are actual protocol notes we were talking about, like,"

And one of the things that Ds o gives us the ability to notice when things aren't working or or aren't proceeding? And so I don't wanna go into too much detail But basically, I just wanted to give you a flavor of like what the discussions were that we had because we would've been nice if we'd had more working group participants there with since out of working with doc yet. That didn't happen. So basically, we just... You know, we discovered some things about how to use Ds and we talked about, like, how we've get into the ready state, which is where we're actually able to you know, inter and do things. And how we validate stale data because Dns use Md s and an Md s does not guarantee that you have her data it just does its best to try to make that happen. And if you don't have accurate data, you shouldn't just, like, sit there using the inaccurate data for, like, you know, however long it takes for time out of the cash. So there's a bunch of work like that. Next slide. And then the other thing is we use this strategy for for, like, agreeing on who's gonna, you know, what what what database we're gonna replicate and it uses the sequence number strategy. And one of the things that we realizes the sequence number strategy was a little bit too clever and complicated. And so we actually came to what I think has a bit of an agreement about to make it less clever at less complicated. Which not gonna go into detail about because if you haven't been following the spec. This is make any sense. But I just put it up there, so that you would see that we had these discussions we took, you know, the the the two slides that I just showed you were basic our notes from the discussion, which we intend to go forward with.

Just Questionnaire, you mentioned the sequence number and then the draft, I think it there data Id there. Detection? So the dataset Id and the sequence number so the sequence number is actually something we use on the thread network, and it's used it's used so that we can see that we're you know, the devices the Sr servers that are on the thread network or advertising correctly I think I think it generalize, like, if we wanna do something similar on the stub that we probably use a similar strategy. So we probably actually wanna talk about this in the document. Basically, the idea is we want a way for devices that are on a network that's being managed by an Sop service to be able to figure out if it's if they see two advertisements, which one to use.

So a six four Well, there is something about using the the the top eight bits as a sequence number, but I don't know how much detail there is about that a document.

So with Sr most recent update obviously is the most authoritative. We don't have the concept of an authoritative zone that's got a serial number that's increment. And so we need some other way to make sure that we don't first of all, that we flush scale data, and secondly that we prioritize good new data. And so we were thinking about you know, reliability when you're trying to have this sort of ad hoc Sr service it's running on your network. And there's two ways that could run. One is you've gut replication the other is you don't. If you don't have S sr replication, you still want it to work. And to make it work, you can use Sr to make sure that you don't continue to advertise stale data when you receive new data on a different partner. So you've got two advertising proxies client collaboration with one, later on registers second. The data on the first one is still valid, at least hasn't expired, but the data on the second one is newer and more correct. And so with Ts, the newer data wins. That's what gets advertised. Without Ts, the scale data went, which is like, really bad outcome. Basically, it means that some device that's advertising is maybe gonna be unreachable for some period of time like an hour. Which would be very bad. So that's without s replication. With Sr replication, things get a little bit better because we recover more quickly, but you can basically have the same scenario during the synchronization. Area where you you know, the first server has has its data, but it hasn't propagated to all the other ones. You can wind up having conflicts and this can produce problems which I'll describe on the next slide. So the the the problems are basically two. One is the scale data. And the other is, one of the ways we deal with state scale data or really with name conflicts as we change names. And so now you've got a service that registered underneath"

    "text": "it some finds itself conflicting with itself because you've got two Sr servers. So we wind up ren renamed that device. And so now it shows up with two different names and the stale data is on the old day but the good data on the new name. And so now we have to, like, go through all of the names and pick the one that actually works and it really sucks. I say this from an implementation experience. So as I say at the bottom of the slide, it makes sense too really hard and we don't want that. So Ts r I think really makes life a lot better when you're doing multiple Sr servers you generally wanna be able to do. Next slide? And then replication why do we want replication? It seems kind of complicated catered Right? The problem is, like, what we really maybe like is for the infrastructure to do to act as an authoritative Dns server and take Sr replicate registrations. And then we wouldn't have this issue. Euro actually does have an Sr server, but they're not really acting in the way that I just described. And so it doesn't actually solve the problem. And, you know, we don't... We wanted to not just be hero that's doing this. So Anyway, the general experience we have is the devices that do this are like you know, home speakers and things like that. You know, the apple Home pod, for example, Apple Tv does it These aren't devices that people think of as infrastructure to buy think of them is just devices that are sitting around. The reason we use them is because they're on all the time usually. There's no guarantee. The uses aren't gonna power cycle them or they might have like, Tv room on a light switch. So it's acting as your your thread server for example, and then you turn off the light switch and you better hope to one of the speakers in the other room is still working. So Sr replication allows us to ride out these kind of events. And that's really the purpose of having it. Next slide,"

    "text": "Yeah. So I think I talked about the authoritative name service It's just basically Sr is trying to replicate an authoritative name service on a on steady ground. And... Ted, if if I may, I just wanted to add a comment. Yes. You you mentioned Apple Tv and home I don't make this sound like it's only... Yeah. Sorry. Things. The the Google home does it the not Led light panels do it. Yep. As you said, aero is supporting this. So we're getting into the situation where a user today if they've got a home Iot setup, could accidentally have four zero five available Sr service, which is great for redundancy. Because as you say if one gets unplugged, There are other ones to take over. And that's why having them called note is important. Yep. So Anyway, that's the the... Thank you for that clarification. Yeah. I I'm a little sleep to deprived and so I apologize for any inaccuracies. So next slide. Okay. There's a next slide. Yeah. So I would like the work group to adopt this work. I think, you know, we we've seen that there there's interest, like, you know, I don't know maybe some people come to the mic say they're interested, but certainly there's at least three people interested you showed up for the inter interrupt and I think I think there's more. So I think that would be good work for us to do. So but? Alright. Queues open. Any thoughts comments questions. Es. Go ahead. Yeah. So one question I had on draft about the T r so"

No. Actually, actually, Ts is used so that so that different Registrar can figure out who has the most recent data client doesn't see the Ts record and we need that on purpose. We don't want to. We don't want the client to have to be doing something new. We felt like it was reasonable for advertising proxies to be doing something new. And so so it's actually the advertising proxy so you use the Ts record and what's called the Probe packet N s. Okay. I'm sending out a probe. This is the new data here's the Ts on it. If you have similar data that also has a Ts on it and it's older please flush it rather than arguing with me. Yeah. Right. So the idea that the Yeah. The mill pole regis basically keep Yeah. Okay. Keep approximately the same time or show whether that they can Good good point. No. So we actually we actually use the time of sending the packet. Yeah. So the Ts in the packet is relative not yeah. Okay. Walls lot time. Relative so Yep. I there's the potential for... Like, if if we get two Sr replication like couple seconds apart, we could have an issue, but that usually doesn't happen. So Yeah. Yeah. That's a rough Yeah. Since one needed happen though. I think that's very good to as a way to yeah, basically solve this issue because we know we have hit it to already. Think the issue will full Yeah. Not not yet synchronized regis. Yep. Okay. And then for the other one, S sap p replication, I think it's also"

    "text": "were very useful, especially in the Iot use cases that you mentioned. Yeah. The only thing is that, of course, our application is not not typically easy a problem to do as in synchronization That has been happening or four decades and and it still goes wrong Occasionally. I think the the thing is if you scale up with the number of devices, so question is how could you make sure that you can support it for for many devices or is there kind of maximum for application. If you say five five on the same link. It can replicate with each other. Yeah. Could still work. But what if it's even more, does it still scale like that? Yeah. So I mean, these are exactly the kinds of questions that make me want to bring this document a working group and not just not just privately publish it because you know, I agree with you. There is a scale of only a potential scalability ability. I think a real scalability issue, because this is essentially connected to top where you really want all of the Sr servers talking to each other And that probably means you don't wanna have an infinite number of them because that would get Ugly. Works fine with five. But but this is something we should be evaluating. That's why I wanna adopt. Okay. Sounds good. Yep. Access Goes stewart. Three for presenting all of this. He said deprived, and I'm not surprised. It's two Am here in California, which is not pleasant for me, but five I am for ted. So thank you. That's five. Yeah. Seriously Thank you. Thank you guys for for showing up in Yokohama oklahoma. I apologize for it in so to speak."

So it uses all this information think the other great replication they will don't quite now what to do. I don't know if you thought about that or what the game plan was. So, basically, that's the whole, like, you know, how do we run question, which I, you know, definitely love to have your eyes on tim. The the the when application starts up. The the server that's just rebooted and basically, is a amnesia goes out in sees if there any servers around it if there are that it tries to connect with them. And and and synchronized so that we wind up basically refreshing the data and the idea is as long as not all of the servers go down at once you don't ever lose your data. If all of them go down at once then, yeah, basically, you're gonna have to somehow advertise on the network that you're supporting Everything went away, please re register, which you know, yeah. Okay. I'll take a look. But yeah, that that that makes sense ted Miss that. Thanks. Sure Thank you. Alright. We're at the end of the queue, I'd say now that we've click the exciting submit button on these other documents. We have room. I would say Adopt more documents in the working group. it feels like the Sr application document has gotten more more interest also Ts depends on it. So let let's talk about that one first. So I'm hearing from Ted from others that there's interests in adopting the Sr replication document, India ssd. From our read, it seems to be in charter. Does anyone have comments specifically about whether they're interested in adoption."

I'd be happy to review this. And I I think we should work on this. Awesome. Great. We're gonna do... Let's do a pull for adoption, which we'll we'll confirm on the list. Sure hands tool Right. Sorry wrong button. Give me a second. Alright. So should we adopt the replication document. Click the raise hand button to say yes. Click the do not raise hand button to say no. Alright. I'll I'll leave up, but I could start talking. It's looking like we have right now, nine votes for nine opinions for yes and zero for now. So it's sounding like there's interest for adoption here. So we're gonna confirm that on the list, but we're in good shape for this one. I'm gonna click the end session. Okay. For this the other document, the Ts"

How Yeah. I don't either there. They've wiped my brain sense. So how about Ted, I'll I'll leave you with an action item to find a across third with a different employee owner name tag? And once that's the case, we'll discuss adoption on the list. How does that sound? Sure. Sounds good. Awesome. Looks like we're pretty much at time. Any final comments or questions that folks want to say. Otherwise, we can wrap up. It's been a good meeting. We submitted two documents for publication. We're on a way to adopting another Good work. Thanks everyone for joining. Especially folks joining him in overnight. Much appreciated. And we will see you all on the mailing list. Cheers everyone? Thank you. Thanks. Bye."
