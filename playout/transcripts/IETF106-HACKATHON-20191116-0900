    "text": "style way and this is like wow this is really good I know there are DNS people who are sort of also scattered at other tables because you actually care about other topics more than the DNS but you still care about the DNS anyone in the room who has like DNS he questions feel free to wander over towards here where were and even though the DNS is like this much of the Internet all y\u0027all are doing a lot of stuff on every other part and that\u0027s really cool too so anyways thanks okay so I know all of you are anxious to to get to what you plan on doing but just want to run through some things especially for those of you who it\u0027s your first time first of all I think you all know what why we\u0027re here and as Paul mentioned I think Alissa did as well we\u0027re really trying to accelerate the work that\u0027s done in the IETF better-quality by you know implementing things as we\u0027re standardizing them and that not only speeds up the process hopefully but that results in a better standard and a shorter amount of time so we have better better impact I\u0027d say and it was great to see so many people who this is your first time here because that\u0027s another big part is to bring new people into the IT especially people who maybe have more of a software development background and wouldn\u0027t have been as interested or know how best to contribute to the IETF but now through code they have a mechanism to contribute and really make a positive impact so so that\u0027s great to see as with everything at the IETF we\u0027re operating under the the note well I\u0027m not going to read through it if you haven\u0027t seen the note well especially if this is your first IETF you can take a look at it it\u0027s online if you have any questions or problems finding it let me or someone else around you know we can help you find it and the the hackathon is a little bit different from a lot of IETF activities and that we do work on code the code that you work on is not necessarily owned by the IETF it\u0027s actually governed by whatever the license is associated with that code so when you\u0027re working on code just you know make sure you\u0027re aware if the terms under which your you\u0027re using and contributing to the code and it\u0027s whatever code you\u0027re working on that\u0027s what\u0027s applicable here okay last I checked we had 38 projects which is great to see and there maybe even a couple more all the projects if you haven\u0027t found the IETF wiki yet all the projects are listed there as well as who\u0027s running the project so if you\u0027re haven\u0027t figured out or if you\u0027re trying to figure out which project to work on take a look and see which one best matches your interests and if you\u0027re not "

    "text": "sure which project to join we were trying something new at this ITF we have a Lost and Found page essentially for lack of a better name this is if you have a project and you need some help advertise what you need there or if you\u0027re not sure which project to work on and you want to you know a little bit more help to see exactly what people need you can go there and see what people need or you can even advertise what the things are you\u0027re interested in that hopefully will help us all find out you know get on a team that we can contribute to so we\u0027re right at this kickoff part and after this really the idea is to break up into the teams so don\u0027t get worried if you haven\u0027t found a team yet that\u0027s what the morning is for is to help you find a team so you can come see me if you\u0027re having a problem go around to the different table see the signs talk to people and and find a team that it looks like it\u0027ll work for you now in order to make it easier for people to continue to work on their projects we will have lunch brought in and then their snacks in the afternoon we\u0027ll have dinner too so the idea is to make it as easy as possible for you to stay here and just to continue to work of course if you have other things you want to do and you want to take off in the evening we understand and and and that\u0027s fine so Sunday will start up at the same time the room will open at 8:30 and lunch will be brought in again one thing I want to warn you of ahead of time is that we do like to have people present what they did what they accomplished what they learned and give you the opportunity to do that so these are very short presentations but we do all those starting at two o\u0027clock tomorrow so that means that really you kind of need to be wrapping up your project maybe around 1:30 so you have some time to put those slides together you don\u0027t have to present but it\u0027s it\u0027s really helpful I think to you and to the IETF if you do because that\u0027s the best way of sharing with everyone around here and people who watch the recording later on what you did and then we do need to clear out of here because this room will be repurposed for something else so the hackathon will end at 4:00 so that newcomers have time to go to the newcomer thing tomorrow and so we all have time to do the rest of the things we do here at the IETF and by 5 o\u0027clock at the latest we need to be cleared out of here so if you have equipment you brought in just be aware of that that we do need to get out of this space so that can be turned over for the next setup yes you\u0027re welcome to leave equipment here tonight okay the project "

    "text": "presentations as I mentioned they\u0027re very short depending on how many we have we usually need to limit them to like right around three minutes so this is a very brief summary of what you did what you learned and what you\u0027re going to bring back to your working group and to help out with those we have a basically a github repo that we load all the project presentations into so there\u0027s something called this is the the IETF hackathon github and within it we have a repo for ITF project presentations if you go into that there are some instructions about how that works including an important thing about you need to be a member of the ITF hackathon github org in order for you to be able to have the privileges or a write permissions so if you\u0027re going to be uploading a presentation make sure you send your github ID to me and I\u0027ll add you to that also in there you don\u0027t have to use this template but if it\u0027s useful for you there is a template it\u0027s in PowerPoint format if someone wants to create it in another format and upload it that\u0027d be great but that\u0027s just to help you with you know creating a short presentation it\u0027s a template that you can you can leverage if it\u0027s useful it is best when you upload into github if you do so with a PDF format because that will be presenting from a shared Chromebook and it just presents best from that okay so when the hackathon is over it\u0027s not really over on Monday we still have what we call a hack demo happy hour and the presentations were really short only three minutes as I mentioned this is a more extended period of time for you to share what you did with the IHF community so if you\u0027re interested and I highly recommend this from 18th from 610 to 740 on Monday we have a space it\u0027s a subset of this room like a portion I think this side of this room where we\u0027ll be having the hack demo happy hour and basically you\u0027ll get a table you can set up you can do a demo for people and just have that more in-depth conversation with them if you want to do that though sign up as soon as possible and definitely before the the deadline on at noon on Monday and there\u0027s links to all these and the wiki plus these slides are uploaded to then throughout the week we have the code lounge and again that\u0027s just right here in this room or at least this part of it and you\u0027re welcome to use that area to continue to work on your projects and to meet with each other there is a board where you can sign up "
