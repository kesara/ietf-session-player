    "text": "true for the the conversations presentations things we do here as well now the the code that you\u0027re working on you should take a look at that you know there\u0027s generally some kind of license associated with that hopefully an open-source license that\u0027s separate from the note well the code you work on it\u0027s not an IETF contribution necessarily it\u0027s just you have to look at the license that\u0027s associated with that code and and if you need help with that too I\u0027m happy to talk with you about it the agenda so we started pretty much on time this is being done on meet echo there\u0027s a meet echo session that\u0027s only going to be for this kickoff part and then we\u0027ll have it again at the end when we do the presentations we will have lunch being brought in that\u0027s at 12:00 thirty and there\u0027s there some dinner will come in two at about seven o\u0027clock so it\u0027d be great if you have time and are able to stick around and and and have dinner with us and continue to work on your projects but really you know manage your own time if you need to go to a meeting or something or if you just want to have a dinner with friends we understand that too but know that we\u0027re bringing the food in to make it as easy as possible for you to continue to work on your projects and then at ten o\u0027clock we\u0027ll close the doors we should be able to lock this room I wouldn\u0027t leave any personal valuables along but if you brought some equipment that\u0027s hard for you to lug around and set up you should be able to leave it here you know we\u0027re gonna leave the obviously the APS the switches all that stays in here so it should be a fairly secure room then it\u0027ll reopen again at about 8:30 maybe a little bit earlier tomorrow so you can get in here and again lunch will be provided now one thing I want to let you know about is although the hackathon doesn\u0027t actually end until four o\u0027clock around two o\u0027clock we ask that people kind of wrap up what you\u0027re doing and set it aside so that we can have some short presentations about what you you achieved right what are the results what things did you learn what are you going to bring back into your working group so the thought is at about two o\u0027clock we we break to do that and think I have some other slides where are going to that in more detail that will be broadcasted on on meet echo and recorded yeah so those presentations they are meant to be very short think about that we will probably have 30 or more presentations and we want to get through them all so we\u0027re talking 2-3 minutes at the most just some highlights so people understand the space you are working in and what you learned and kind of give them that reason to come talk to you more right and learn more it\u0027s just a great way to share information across groups here at the IETF so we do have an IETF hackathon github organization "
