So let's have that on the list. I I wanna dig in more to this in review etcetera by I think it sounds like a very good direction. What I was coming to ask is, could we get some like, test vectors or example that would help like when we try to implement and play with things, since this is, you know, about novel. We wanna make sure that particularly with these structures that have particular lengths having done similar things with privacy pass tokens and stuff in structures there can be a lot of just mistakes in implementations by not reading carefully how long fields are be in how things are supposed to be hash, etcetera. So Some test factors at the end would be really, really helpful. That should be possible. Yeah. K, Tim Remotely? Go ahead.

Here you see we The new text changed the name used to query or the redirection record away from the S u the Dd used to the name of the resolve itself. There's still some open discussion on that, but that's the current state of the text. We added some guidance on how to handle a multitude of edge cases redirection chains, multiple redirects. We defined how to determine the effect of T pto of her redirection which really comes down to the minimum along the path that you travel. Alright. Added Tls minimum version as one example of a comp requirement. So we had always required that if you're a dose server redirecting to another server, it needs to at least support though or whatever else the client currently had so you don't send them somewhere, they may not compatible with Tls minimum version same thing. If the client connected over to us one dot two, it be to support tls one dot two.

And the two most common arguments we saw were that This would force resolve to store their D configuration and their R and the same zone, which is trying to painful full. And that naive resolve can pass this query up stream And that's the thing that we're still open on. So I'll address that. Again at the end of the deck. Next slide. So generally, if not a good idea to go creating redirection loops or redirect a lot. Novel concept we added some text to elaborate on that. Self free redirection was defined as based on name. So if you refer to yourself the same name as the connection, that's a cell redirection and we're done. Again, ben pointed out on the list that we can get the best of both worlds if we just say, you can redirect to another Ip of the same name if the client... If the server provides a set of Ip ips that don't include the one that declines currently communicating on. This seems reasonable But this is the current state of the text. So I... But I think that's reasonable. Next slide, please. And one point, I did forget on that one is when you self advertise, you could also advertise more config. That the client on know about. So comparison with http to b three or http redirects and all service work going on elsewhere. So alt service b, which actually was just mentioned a couple minutes ago.

Next slide, please. I Hey, martin. Mike bishop. I just wanted to distinguish that. The service b records are for pre connection. The old service header and old service b is its successor?

But the first two very obvious ones that we've been discussing since your last email chain. One. Abuse of the target name. You're absolutely right. Shouldn't surprise me at this point. We're discussing some other options about how to communicate a name we wanna move to, but that a technical problem that hinges on the bigger issue, which I think is where you're headed. Which is why are we redirecting to other names in the first place? And the primary scenario that we've been discussing and I welcome my c authors to speak up if other details come up, but in a scenario where you're using this to replace any cast you would want the server that you're configuring widely to have access to a key that you may not want all of your distributed servers to have. That way, if they each have their own keys, If one is compromised, it can be revoked. Redirection can be revoked but the main server is not compromised. Containerized which means that we need to find a way somehow allow one server to redirect to another where the name ends up changing. Target name is not the right field to do that. That's fair. And for your concerns on the naive resolve. As you pointed out, just changing the names to the name of the resolve does not guarantee that in R naive resolve will end up intercept a query for its own name. It can still send it upstream. We've been talking through our to solve that, and this is definitely where we'll go"

I wanna say, I I understand and appreciate the idea of having a a potential high value global certificate that you don't necessarily want to plant private keys for inside all of the all of the various Geo specific servers that you're trying to redirect to you know, that seems like certainly an understandable desire here. I was I I was specifically talking about on slide five, it it seemed like there was a a sort of factual question that I think gets to the high gets to the the core of this particular this particular little debate. Sure. Because in... It mentions Http alt service, as precedent for the idea of redirect redirecting and accepting the redirect based on be transport security of the connection over which the redirect information was given. But that's actually not how http service works. H alt service, does the thing that I've been talking about where the the new host still has to present the certificate for the original name."

So that's good to know. Okay. Noted. So then how do you feel about the approach going forward then slide aside. Yeah. I So overall, my my view is that there's kind of a a simple safe thing to do. Which is to just not change the authentication name. And require all instances of the service to prove the same identity. And to me, it seems like we ought to solve that case because it its security properties are a lot simpler and clearer. And then if we still need this... You know, if we still need this sort of more aggressive mobility where we we need the ability to redirect users to some other service that is for Tls purposes, not the same service as the one you started with. Then then we can sort of come back to the design and think harder about the security implications of that that would be to me sort of the easiest way to to do this because there are there are other alternatives.

While, the private keys for that's to get are held in a data center is that adds a little bit of latency to the handshake. But but then the rest of the connections are fast and local. So there are lots of different architectures that we can talk about to solve the the sort of more aggressive redirection problem. That's a good example. Sorry. Go ahead. Can I throw a few cents in here? This is Jon Tong. So I think one of our goals with initially and the contemplation of it is the ability to distribute again, within a trusted trusted sphere to be the the work the task. We know we've seen in conversations, although I I put the mouth of anybody implementing this, but in see places like Dns for Eu. Where there's an interest in how how regional trust model created or at least that was in the part of the initial conversations where they go with within or not of now, but where one company can actually redirect inside to another company by is could choosing a redirection. The m initially was considering how do you do shared cast That's a really terrible model. So this seems to solve that or make this possible to solve both inside an organization where you have different security models in different names space but also between organizations where you're definitely gonna have different search and and or very... It's gonna be impossible to share start data."

And then there's second or a different version of this, which allows transfer across domains or across their search in some fashion. So that's definitely we're thinking about, but the... You know, the hope is again, to decentralized think a little bit more than they have then. Okay. Tim, next to the queue. Yes. Ben from what I gather, I'm I'm thinking when you start up, you would go to the central place to get that main private key, and then you probably fetch it every so often on some T hours something. Is that how you seeing that So no. I'm I'm talking specifically about systems where you you do where where the private key for the servers private key for Tls never leaves some secure facility, which is not the same facility where Tls is is being terminated. So the handshake is is... The the diff helmet handshake happens to some central facility, a session key, diff home output is generated and that is moved to the box that's terminating the session.

Your okay sharing your certificate get to maybe large scale infrastructure that's present in protected environments.

There are a couple of different approaches we can take here. And one of the ones we've talked about internally is essentially forcing a redirection chain to follow the Tls certificate, you know, chain model. So for instance server one, the very first you're talking to is might have, you know, get in this case diana ns stock quad dot net. Server two then also has to have you, star quad nine dot net, which follows the same logic as the is required inside of the service approach. But then what we would do is we could potentially say server two and then server three, you know, being the final redirected the the final intended server would actually then share a certificate So server... So the certificate on server one would be present on server one and Server two. The certificate for Server two would be present on server two and server three. And therefore, we've maintained an unbroken chain of Tls authorized right, Strategic authority, authorized servers. In order to ensure that there is an unbroken chain of of trust between these systems. So you're never... You never be just being redirected off into the Wilderness. You're not being sent to some random third party. Is that... Is that relatively clear that's that's one of the things we've talked about. We have two other models that we've been discussing. Involving Dns validation and and remaining in Invalid can a few other things I don't think we're quite ready to talk about those. Okay. Thank you, Corey.

So if at all possible, I'd say, find way to not change that origin and only stick to redirects that keep the origin the same. If that's hard, yeah.

That I mean, from the the security components are certainly or like, how do you share the certificates is I think a core component of the reason but being able to share across domains is also there are also policy reasons for that as well, which are separate from what we're talking about far as the some of the issues underlying search sharing. I'm not sure if I was sure a. Go ahead Sorry. I'm not sure I found out here across grades. So as an example, it might be the case that you wish to actually transfer this resolution to if you're as an example inside of a large corporation, there's a single name that everyone in the corporation uses to find essentially a run day server. They connect to that the first time they do their resolution they are redirected or they create a redirection policy which then redirects them to the policy resolve inside their own department. So that may be a different domain space. In other words, it would be engineering dot food dot com. So there's both the the reason to distribute our or have cert isolated, but also there may be a reason to actually change the resolve based on policy that is that is top down, Meaning that the top level or the first result in the chain trusts, wherever it's redirecting the the end user too, but there's a slightly different policy in place. But again, the chain of trust is not broken because you've got server a, has to actually believe and understand what the policy is a result or be in or to do the redirection. But I I understand your your perspective on on certain and distributed then. Sure.
