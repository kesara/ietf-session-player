Allow me to speak to you all today or this title of the presentation is addressing Genes test of sec synchronization vulnerability. So starting out with G, Genes is Gps except it's broader. There's multiple solutions now. We have Europe we've China. We have multiple systems now Genesis is the broad category. And all g signals are one way."

If we start with our Gps satellite, you can see my cursor. If we submit a signal, And there's a there's adversary middle that signal. This could be a basic repeater. Just literally listen broadcast. The receiver will perceive the the clock is lagging. So we have one way signal. Is no way for me to get around this. The only way to do this is with an out of bed people. And if I have that signal that I can certify that the the that my delay is found based off of that that network traffic. And so the the current state of the art for Dns authentication uses an algorithm called tesla, which stands for time efficient street loss tolerance operation. The reason why we have to use this our but this because Genes signals generally have extremely bandwidth we're talking fifty bits per second. The way that tesla works is it's constructed in a specific cadence where we send messages we submit a commit of those messages and then we distribute a key later. Okay. So message commit key message currently the key. And the delay of us to provide that authentication because the construction of these keys are specific way we can provide crypto graphics. Authenticity. In my paper work, I labeled this delay capital data. The key release delay. So this is the time from this commitment to the release the key. I have colors on here to demonstrate that. So the typical delay that we're talking about here is it depends on the G system. Galileo is Europe's answer to Gps and Chime"

On that, the the key release delay will be thirty seconds to two minutes or two to six seconds depending on your system boat, I specifically work on Spas. Sps is a constellation that is that ensures that aircraft are within six seconds of Gps failure. Have listing stations throughout the continent that are listening to the Gps signal if there's ever issue. They're immediately notified via his constellation been six seconds. And all of my diagrams I From for increasing time release. Start with us the messages and in the... Yeah. The problem clock lag. When we have a tesla system, once the key is made public, people can make forged messages. So in order for tesla to be secure, we need to provide a file on a clock offset. So on screen, I have my my normal message cadence. And then here is a delayed cadence. So we have an adversary that's delaying the signal. If they're able to delete a signal more than capital data, then they can listen for the key and force messages. So this diagram. We'd left to write an increasing tire of release. So My receiver is perceiving time and it delay state So far delayed that the key is been released, the adversary, uses the key to generate the best now we have a forged signal. This happens if my clock offset, lowercase data is less than negative big data. So if money it's if my receiver clock, seven seconds behind. For the System. Then my receiver would accept. So why do we have this vulnerability? So In the original tesla scheme, there is a bootstrap procedure. Where the key released delay is set individually by provider and receiver."

In if it adversary interferes with that moose strap that a key slight increases. So effective denial service as possible four three is not. But with Gps tesla, the key release delay has to be system wide in the multi kind multi content. So we we can't add individual settings. Everybody has to have a clock. This within a specific offset. Individual clocks also have sarcastic drifts and knowledge of that insecure clock would reveal whether or not receiver will accept for. So if if my clock spontaneously goes to an offset of more than seven seconds. Or more than six seconds. And somebody knows about it. Then I know that that specific receiver will fix up for trees. And in my paper I show that there's a simple test to find and Secure outliers. Very, very simple. I will go really quickly through the slide. But essentially, if if I'm using my basic protocol and I'm intercept nt message and the clear I can just measure the the receipt time using top of the t one inside the timestamp stamp, I can infer whether or not a specific clock is delayed. With high probability. So these these equations just described that test. But I can listen to the traffic and t one and inside of T isn't isn't it clear. Then I should be able to find those outliers. So So here's the vision of the feature of why this is important. So we have autonomous cars in Thomas aircraft soon we're gonna have Tesla enable G authentication. Requirements are gonna come in to say you need to have an authentic signal for your safety of line applications. So you're driving a autonomous car you'll better be authenticating your Gps.

Aircraft, the context for aircraft is that receiver for manufacturers for do not in internet connection. So what that's gonna look like is we'll have a nice clock on the and then through periodic maintenance, we'll we'll do we'll do synchronization, but for autonomous vehicles anticipate that. You know, the vehicle could just synchronize whenever it want. So for an attacker, the the attacker only needs to wait and find a a bad vehicle. So you know, if if I I might not be particularly... I might not particularly care about which specific vehicles is bad. But if once I find a vehicle, I can drive it off the road. This type of spoof is actually not recurrent in in warfare now, and it's actually been demonstrated that we can cause a tesla to go on to the wrong exit. You anyway. So previous research considers estimating clock balances. This is a figure from one of those plots. So if we have concerned the estimates of what clock looks like over time between your aircraft maintenance, we can can expand this. So this is, like, this is. They start with the synchronization, and this is my bound over time and this would be the time when I need to res synchronized. But from my perspective, for aircraft, specifically, they they are they go through large temperature changes. So my professor would say that clock makes it better thermometer than in actual clock. Which she's joking, but the point is that, you know, airplanes also experience radiation. There's going to be a element that we're going to have buyers. And now there's a test to see I can find this specific out outlier. Right? I... There's very easy test for me to find those out outlier.

Well, I want you'd imagine cell, on an airplane and the Gps receiver is ga bus and so they need to they need to take thirty minutes to layer your flight and replace the receiver, but now the server is busy or or or not working like we'll have an issue where we cannot fly.

I hope so, but I'm not sure because one thing we actually had one issue that we didn't respond to time requests because they were they were adding padding to a field that we didn't back than bad for padding to, and we were quite strict in the Fpga implementation. So I actually had to lose some one of our checks to be a bit more lenient. So I do not believe it's one of the normal the... I don't believe it's cro nor nt is the client. It's probably a custom client. And it might be that that client might might actually do sort of a k request a time request. And then forget all about it and then do it again. But that's just my suspicion. But I don't know yeah I think we're interested to figure out We we we'd love to hear from the implement. The people that have put this in whatever devices they put it in. David Yeah. I wondering you were mentioning these slightly mel requests where they the occur walter a little because we might have sent a few in the development process our implementation. All of them. Sort of one percent or ninety percent of the traffic seems to come from one client and it does this thing. And then we have sort of a few percent that are sending requests that we the way that we expected them to be So one moment manufacturer probably put this in as a default in their devices, and They've started rolling it out in October last year, and they've been just sort they're rolling it out to more and more machines. As time goes by. And it's should be off. So we're about two million requests per hour now. And that that's not very much. I mean, that's five hundred requests per second, and it's not really that much"

It's coming. Hope it work. Yeah. I can see it. Thank you. Okay. So, yeah, regarding the nt for okey protocol no much as changed yet. So I will keep it short here. Let's just point a small overview about nt for Pt is about the goal of nt As a realization of security measurements for Pt two point one, and we have two communication modes to be distinguished would have different list to be secured. So the first one Pt cars and mix multi cost connections. Here we use a key. Technically, we can use tesla based key exchange but it's more complex so therefore, we use a key. The current and test on. The second mode involves negotiated cost connections for this just to ask aims for secured and to end connections. A basic idea is we use"

As of months, I work on Pt I I started again, on test for P and currently consolidating all the documents, mails and feedbacks. To push the content to to go further. And yeah, what is the next step? I know nobody has time to read seventy pages of a draft document and therefore I plan to prepare two documents for the booking group. The first one is too long to bit version of for Pt.

Were planning to also state the security goals and assumptions in the document because it was reading the draft just before this meeting get a bit of a sense for this topic, and I was missing noticing I'm missing a lot of context around what exactly the security model here is, what it's trying to achieve and what the assumptions are being made on the p b side of things. You This is very complex and Kd, we have different aspects. So we have different communication as I said cost and duty customer communications where we have different security solutions to to cover. And also, we need to define the communication between the key server And so time server side, and Nt for anti pieces of limitation. Dependent, but it doesn't work if we use"

I want to what these documents to to make it easier for you to see what's going on and this is put a, how does it work? So this this is the reason for the to london wind version. So maybe going to pages And I guess it makes easier to to discuss this in content. So... Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess at this stage welcome back to the Nt ats for Pt work, and we will look forward to your contributions. But thank you very much. So the next thing on the agenda is the Nt p over Pt I know there's been virtually no changes on this. Mae, Did you have anything you wanted to say?

As far as I understand what's we'll have some more time going forward and I'm trying to make time so... And but we definitely have intent to to publish new drafts with changes. The current draft I think expires in two days. And my goal was definitely to get at least something done before then. We've...

So thank you very much for those. So a couple of issues. I would love to get comments on right now is multiple people have asked about the message format and that includes Martin's common yesterday? Asking, you know, why don't for the tag length values or that. And also what martin brought up is that's currently rough time does not use network by order.
