We right away, we have a full agenda. On the slide, you are on the screen, you already see the note well, it applies also to an IV meeting because we're part of the IETF meeting week. I hope you know about this. It gives you references to all the policy should know about. Maybe IPR is less important in this session. starting. Thank you. But I want to point you to the code of conduct it's really important that we all work together in a friendly, a nice way because that gives us the best outcome makes everybody most comfortable. Next slide. So the the previous slide that you'd enjoyed by Also, I mentioned that you need to log in to meet echo because we want you on the blue sheet. That's important for our meeting planning. For all kind of purposes, legal versus and so on. So we want to have a good transparent record of what we're doing in these meetings. So please join the mid echo Please use Mead echo also for joining the queue. and, again, be nice. And also note that this is recorded in live screen. So Yes. Next."

We're in the welcome part, as you might have recognized, We established this kind of practice of of asking one of our leaders or managers to give a short report about what happening in their organization, and I believe People like it, so we continue that. This time, it will be Martin Thompson about W3C. We have an invited talk So that will be Nick Farrell. I'm talking about fragmentation and centralization. And then we have a a longer time slot to talk about one of the proposed programs from the IB new proposed programs. on identity management, and we have some time for discussion there. because we have a 1 a half hours slot this time, We also offered Elliot Leer, the ISE, a slot to talk about one of his recent draft that he processed. So, hopefully, we will have time for that. And then if everything goes well, we might even have an mic at the end, but I don't promise that card Okay. Next slide. Just a very quick reminder, what is IAB open So IAB open is kind of the forum for the IAB to mainly talk about our technical and textual work and also a little bit about our liaison work. But what we really want to do with the session is to 1st give you a little bit of visibility about what we're doing. but then also get feedback from you from the community about all work. If you if you're engaging in the session with us here today that great. Looking forward for the discussion, but you can also reach us anytime You can reach send us an email. You can send us an email visually to all the IB members, you can talk to us during the meeting, of course, And then there's architecture discussed, which is a little bit our discussion. list. So if you are not aware of that, you might subscribe there. There's also for each of the programs, there's a list. And if you have any questions about Nissan Coordination, we have"

So finally, we published the maintaining robust robust protocol document, which has been with the IV for a very long time now. And I think now we got, like, a good stake here. And then new document or newer newer document on application network collaboration using testing that both of them are published. Please read them I really like them. you don't like them, let me know. If you like them, let me know. we have the MTM workshop report, which is ready for publication. The workshop was, like, a year ago, I guess. So I think this is still a reasonable time, but we should really publish it. And then there's also another workshop report which will hopefully come out very soon. There's one kind of document in the go. This is still kind of more or less first version of your document. We didn't have time to do a revision this time, but we're working on it. So the privacy partitioning 1 is the one that we're still working on. Next, technical program updates. This is actually there's somebody is somebody in the queue. Yes. Security enthusiast. So Two things. Two things. 5 minutes for the previous part is really short, surprising, but perhaps as the normal way, which means that we confidently discuss things. in the in the equivalent of this slide on the web, there is a point on which does not appear here. I think there is a real point on discussing years on because I'm working in the ITU. I made the point in PITG yesterday, in the ATU, we are sending liaisons here. we never get answers.

I really have problems with these reports. really have problems with the representations activity there. I I I disagree with the number of things there. They could have been other things that that should have been mentioned here, but now it's too late. So I don't know how we process these things, unfortunately, but I don't know how you want to do that in 5 minutes, or we do that line or whatever is your way forward, Chairman. Thank you. Thanks, Sanu. So, like, I think the the liaison staff, we do have our office hours, like, where we can actually talk about it. It's actually in the slide, like, in the timing. So you can just come by, we can certainly talk about it. There's like a we cannot do this in 5 minutes, like you said. Right? So so there's an hour can come by. And like, for the document itself? Yeah. Also, on the on the ITU issue that you mentioned, this is something that we are discussing. I in the leasing orders between the leases and the shares. or codeinatus and so on. So this is this is ongoing, but it's the focus of this meeting. We only have 1 a half hours. But, like, come talk to us. That's always the answer. think you wanna say something about m 10, but yeah. Go ahead. real really, really briefly, we will work with you on the m 10 report. Obviously, we want to address community comments and the the reposition representation points are very valid. I plan on fixing that. It probably won't be this week, so, you know, expect an answer next week. But we will absolutely have that dialogue with you Yeah. So, definitely, mean, thank you for any feedback, but I also want to say because your point your higher layer point was that there's not enough time for discussion.

So we'll go back on the is on our open hour or whatever? Please come on Thursdays. Okay. But we also have some information about liaisons here. We're just in the middle, so let's to the next slide. So that's the part about program updates. This is just a quick update about the one program that is still running. And this program, the goal is to talk about availability deployability and maintainability of protocols and our and also implementations of the protocols The I already mentioned the the document that was published recently, which was discussed in this group. There's also another draft about a new draft about greasing. So that's really brand new. It was just published at the draft deadline a few weeks ago. Please read that one. It's an early phase, and there is also a draft about code maintenance. This one will be presented tomorrow, not today in dispatch, gender dispatch. If you want to discuss that one, it's also coming out this group, but it has an applicability to, like, the whole IETF. So, hopefully, we can move it over to the to process it there.

It should be a venue for have discussions about environmental impacts. And and I hope we figure out any kind of attend and talk about any kind of topics are not yet in the IETF or or IRTF. But, also, we are looking for things that we can identify and can go back into the IETF, and we can do in this organization. Again, this is also, like, all technical programs open to everybody. There is a mailing list you can subscribe to But we are in the process of creating this program, so we didn't fully decide yet because what we want is your your feedback from the community. about this program, the scope of the program, so please provide us input. This this is a point of time right now. And then the other proposed program is later on the agenda, so that's quite empty because you will hear more about it. Do you wanna take those? Yeah. Sure. And I don't know, like, just to go for this. Right? So there's a lot of updates, like, on the liaison we got, like, 25 latest and statements since the last ATF. And so, like, one of the Leah since that's a 3gpp. So we had a meeting on Monday, so it went, like, extremely well. and the ROC that describes a relationship is pretty out of date. So there's gonna be some work to update that, bring it up to cold. And for the higher bandwidth discussions with early essence, I think Tommy sent out a mail to the liaison coordinators for all the liaisons, like, that we are gonna have an office hours. So it's at lunchtime on Thursday, so please do come by. we can certainly discuss and, like, go through the liaisons and see what requires responses.

There's some important things to note here. HTML is not really their business at this point. that has been moved to a group called the what working group. there's a number of other documents in that sort of space as well. but they look after HTML. CSS, fonts, svg, A lot of the things that you would use on the web, all of the dominant faces, in particular, are theirs.

It is recently formed into an independent nonprofit I think they followed a lot of the IETF LLC. thing with great interest and managed to form a similar sort of organization earlier this year, in fact, and that that has moved from a somewhat unusual organizational structure into a more conventional one with an independent board. I think Someone requested that I mention that there is no longer a beneficiary benevolent dictator for life as part of the organizational structure. it it is now much more community governance and very much in line with the the style of governance that we see here in the ITS Although, work continues on that one, the number of challenges involved in that one. There's there's a a large team there that's involved more actively in the in the work that goes on there. But otherwise, very, similar in terms of the style of work, though I would point out that we treat mailing lists as the primary venue for engagement in working groups they treat GitHub as the primary venue. for interactions, and there's a bit of a a style difference there in in in terms of of how they work there.

So there's a number of different interactions with the IETF over the over recent years, you will notice there's something of a theme that that sort of flows throughout all of these things. we see a lot of these features that are built for the web developed in in two places. and the primary pattern that we see here is that the w three c will look at the the interface, the the way in which it integrates with a web browser security implications of that side of things, whereas the IOTF will spend time on protocols and the security of the protocols. Some of that is in in progress. You know, privacy pass there is IETF working group. There's no formal work working group currently in the in double three c, but that that is work in progress over there. Other interesting things is that HTTP originally sort started under the w three c umbrella, but it's now very much an an IETF thing. It has been for a long time. and won't say anything about the bottom point. And that's all I have. I think it's probably good if there's questions. if people have questions now, we have a couple of minutes, but Come and see me if you have any questions.

This is my first IETF. I'm really happy to be here and happy to kind of you know, ingratiate myself into this community a little bit So this is about fragmentation and centralization on the Internet. And by way of introduction, you know, I I got interested in this work in about 2019. And I was doing my postdoc and my post doctoral advisor, Steven Weber, came to me and said, What's going on with Internet fragmentation? Everyone's talking about Internet fragmentation. What is it? Is it real? What it has happening specifically and mechanically? and what is the direction and velocity of this trend over time if it is indeed real? And at that time, there were these headlines, like, the Splinternet is already here. The Splintrinet is growing."

And in all of these, there was this kind of vague and deed of 3 sense of Internet fragmentation. That begs the question still, you know, what is There's a lot of implicit understanding, but explicitly, what is Internet fragmentation. So here's my own frame. The intuitive picture behind Internet fragmentation as it was understood by policymakers, not the IETF, as it was understood by the non tech community at that time. is that a supposedly global Internet is becoming increasingly different in different countries. national borders with the with the with a kind of the area of interest. And, of course, there are consequences here for freedom of speech. investment, technological development, political relations, which we'll talk a little bit more later. But this is what people were thinking of when they talk Internet fragmentation at that time. So how do we measure it? Well, I did some work basically taking proxy measures at different layers of the Internet stat. and I don't I've decided to elude this the details on this with this audience today. can find that at this link, and I think that these slides are available somewhere so you would have access them follow-up if you wanna learn more about the methodology here. But what I found was surprising to policymakers, and we're probably not surprise this audience. Oh, I see. I I this is an older version of the slide. That's fine. What I found is that the Internet is multipolar. And that the simple story, the policy makers told about free Internet versus the closed Internet, free countries, you know, Countries with a free Internet versus countries with a closed Internet was overly simplified. And to take a very simple and tightly scoped example, think about the transition between ipv4 and ipv6. So, you know, there is some degree of Internet fragmentation. Some, you know,"

They come off of someone's balance sheet somewhere, and there are times policies we could think about that can move the needle on this. But that wasn't really what policymakers we're talking about. they had different questions that were ultimately about different kind of political things. Yeah. couple of sending me just away from the mic for a little more people. Oh, absolutely. too loud? a little bit closer. Yeah. That's perfect. That's perfect. That's Yeah. Thanks. So what were we talking about? So we looked instead to talk about content blocking because we felt that the discussion of policymakers were having was ultimately discussion about politics. And we felt that content blocking was the thing we could measure technically that would reveal something political So what we did was take this IC Lab dataset, which, you know, you can kinda follow through I this is an old version of slides. That's okay, though. I'll I'll circulate or find a way to circulate a newer version So we took this IC Lab dataset that kind of we used to see what was blocked in different countries where there was evidence of of, you know, some kind of tampering or dropping packets along the wire and and related that to host names. And we took those host names and ran it through this kind of this commonly available dataset that categorizes those websites by the kind of content they have. And this dataset actually was used by corporate firewalls for kind of blocking, you know, shifting access to gambling websites or pornography websites or the things like that. And we use that to categorize, basically, who's blocking what kinds of content You can see a little sample of the dataset here. What you can see is that different countries are interested in blocking and things. South Korea blocks a tremendous amount of pornography, most of what's Korea Block's pornography. And on the other hand, you know, a lot of the content that you see blocking Turkey is categorized as news and media in that days."

    "text": "So our hypothesis here is, you know, we're not taking a normative kind of view of what should or shouldn't be blocked or whether things should or shouldn't be blocked. what we tried to do instead was take a descriptive view of which countries block similar types of content. which country's blocked content that was in a similar vein, a similar that was categorized similarly to others. So we created this map and and, again, if you follow through to this paper, you can even see an interactive version of this map. explore and see a force diagram and all other Quinn's cuts of neat things. And what we find, first of all, is that there's a tight cluster here. most countries really don't block much, and they're probably similar to one another. And Some countries are outliers. Venezuela blocks, you know, kind of idiosyncratic content, basically, things that that are about the the regime there. And then there are other countries that actually have surprising similarities. you know, a a China and Hong Kong can see Hong Kong plays this position between China and and kind of this this main block, which is, you know, kind of provocative observation in in its own right. But what really kind of tickled our interest about this was that when we correlated these similarities, to other facets that are of interest to to a political scientist. like military alliances and trade agreements, What we found is that if you're in a military alliance with someone, probably block a similar concept. If you're in a train agreement with someone, you probably block similar content. you're more likely to be in a trade agreement with someone that you block similar content to, then you are with someone who you don't. And what we concluded from this basically is that these relationships reflect and likely go on to shape, maybe a two way direction of causation, these geopolitical relationships.

Don't don't try to don't try to interpret this diagram. The point is it's very There are a lot of different things that happen when you try to visit a web page. But one thing we can do, and this is building off of data collection's analysis, is boil this down to a few key control points. These are things that you cannot route around. And in fact, we did this work and conjunction with the Internet society for the Pulse pulse Internet pulse dashboard, which I'm sure a lot of people here are familiar with. We contributed kind of this data and and the framework for the centralization part of the Internet. Pulse dashboard. So in order to do that, we identified these key control points, certificate authority is, you know, who does web hosting, who does proxy services think of that as content distribution networks of people like Cloudflare, DNS servers, you know, DIN, Cloudflare also. data centers, top level domains, all of that. And for each of these, we did kind of a mix of data collection and manual coding process sees to see who is your whose jurisdiction is where? And what jumped out is this right away is that the jurisdiction for the companies that run a lot of these services is the United States. And in fact, we can create this kind of diagram. The the proportion of each of these control points, who's provided by US Based Corporation. we look at the market share, let's say, of of Prop of CDNs. We say, okay.

And this is you know, has been relevant to US interests before. Who here is out of curiosity? Who here is familiar with the operation in our sights? Okay. Very few people. Okay. Great. Well, here's a very interesting tidbit for you, and the new version of the slide will have a reference to some work on this. immigration customs and enforcement ICE. has been running since 2006, this program called operation in our sites. What they do is, basically, when someone is kind of, you know, running a foul of of of intellectual property, let's say, or or something else then ICE can go and seize from the domain registrar the domain registry back end, that website. So this has been used for, you know, clear web drug marketplaces. This has been used for people selling counterfeit seat belts. Very wide variety of of things that been enforced against. What's fascinating about it is, first, It exploits the fact that registry back ends are based in the US and uses this kind of of seizure process to take advantage of this. And second, this whole process happens without due process. So this is actually, you know, forfeiture civil forfeiture without due process. And in some cases, ICE has done the civil forfeiture process on US citizens. doesn't you know, if you're not from the US, that's that's not supposed to happen. But the conditions of recourse.

So proxy services so you may be familiar with content distribution networks Cloudflare, Akamai, things like that, Amazon Cloudfront, you can see that the overwhelming majority almost all CDNs are run by US Companies by market share. The CDN is not every CDN in the world. But the CDNs that people use 97.6% are based in the United States. Next slide, please. So if you've ever tried to use Tor, which I imagine that people in this room have. You know that it's a huge pain to use in practice because you're constantly getting captured. And the reason you're constantly getting It is that these CDNs have decided that it's simply not worth their time to allow tour trafficking. towards traffic tends to be malicious. It's, you know, broadly implicated in DDoS attacks. makes it hard for them to do the kind of DDoS mitigation that their customers paid them for. So they just block it. Now this has kind of some interesting consequences that we could discuss later. you know, you know Tori, probably know that it's was largely funded by the US. Department of Defense for kind of, you know, international interests of United state. So there's this interesting kind of conflicting sets of interests here, between the Department of Defense And Private Corporations in the who aren't necessarily cooperating fully, but that's a topic for another time.

In the Duke Law review oh, previous slide, please. In this Juke law review piece we have coming up, you'll we kind of make this argument that's you know, a basically an anti trust or monopoly argument. What we show, and you can see from this diagram is that content distribution networks. So not only overall domiciled in the United States, there are a few players who really dominate the market, and almost all of the market is dominated by the top 3. And, you know, this graph, I would say, you can look at it a few ways Cloudflare has a huge market share in part because the long tail of Internet companies use cloud player. but don't count out fastly and cloud front in Akamai. Akamai in particular is a favorite of really, really big content providers like HBO, Max, or you know, they'll they'll tend to use Akamai. But, you know, the point remains no matter how you slice it, they're very small handful of companies that absolutely control this market. So that's a concern at least for antitrust to the US and the fact that this is overwhelmingly a a kind of a US based story tells you a lot about kind of where the control of the Internet is. Remember, again, content distribution networks sit between user queries and server responses. If the CDN doesn't wanna show you some The user's not gonna get it. there's some interesting research recently about how dominant CDNs really are with respect to end users' experience of the Internet, something like 76% of all user requests to CDNs can be delivered to those users without traversing the tier 1 ISPs at all. While these CDNs have totally cut the tier of the traditional tier one public core of the Internet out of the picture.

So the finding there then is that US Organizations, a effectively control the global Internet through their control over these key control points. And my takeaway from this, what I surmise is that what we observe as Internet fragmentation is not a response to a global Internet, so much as a response to a US controlled Internet. It is that fundamental US control that drives a lot of the fragmentation behavior we observe. And although I didn't get a chance to get into it, it is unclear fundamentally what we mean by fragmentation. Some people consider, you know, egdpr to be kind of fragmenting because it produces different versions of websites in different countries, which is some sense in a front a front to a global Internet. And while that is the case, I think that the differing opinions of Europeans, the legitimacy in their signs of of sovereignty shows in some sense you know, proves out this this thesis in some sense Next slide, please. Okay. Next slide, please. We'll we'll ignore this for now. Okay. So well, this is this is an old slide.

I I hope, you know, to get feedback from from you about these questions and kind of what you So my observation is that, you know, regardless of what we might decide Internet fragmentation is and decide how we might consider the problem of, like, decentralization. You know, personally, I consider centralization to be a really big problem because it centralizes points of control. The CDNs, in particular, might be a very appealing target for sophisticated APT attacks, which could be, you know, very, very"

We understand, I think, far too little about what the market looks like for things like DNS servers and things like content distribution networks. How does this market fit together? what are the incentives that people in this market deal with and and what drives behaviors of of market participants. This isn't the only question we could ask, but it's something that we surely need to know if we wanna make any progress on this. And to illustrate this point, you know, I've been working with a little bit with Scott Schenker at UC Berkeley who has some really interesting proposals around he calls the InterEdge. Basically, these composable extensions used to be called the extensible Internet extensions to kind of TCP IP that provide a lot of the services that CDNs provide. things like DUS mitigation, and, you know, caching, things like that. can be provided by these decentralized nodes. Now if we want these sorts of things catch on, we'll have to understand, first of all, who's the customer who's going to use these? And second, choose the provider and what are those providers' incentives. trying to understand these market dynamics will help us understand how we might stand to get uptake around these things and what we can do from a policy perspective to make those broke healing, 2nd, another question specific question that's been on my mind recently, is what exactly is the nature of the relationship between telecom providers and content distribution networks. So a puzzling example and something that's been puzzling me And if anyone here has any insights, please tell me. It's that AT and T a telecom, in fact, my telecom, owns HBO. another service I like I enjoy to use. And my collaborator, Tejas near Chania, Berkeley Law, asked me one day, hey.

So I did a little googling and Akamai and AT and T have a relationship with each other. What is the nature of the relationship between Akamai and AT and T? Why is it that AT and T would bother having CDN and we'll need to go and use Akamai for their content delivery. Is the CDN no good? Are they not good at competing with Akamai? are they white labeling their own transit to Akamai, that's why it looks like Akamai. is Akamai white labeling their service to AT and T so that AT and T use their kind of retail relationships with small tomediumenterprises. What's going on? The fact that I can't answer this and shows us how little we know about how this market fits together. if we don't understand how this market fits together, I'm very pessimistic about our ability to do anything to enhance this kind of problem of centralization and let alone to do anything fragmentation that results from So that's the end of my 20 minutes.

So, yeah, I really appreciate your slide. I don't think it had a number on it, but where It really aligned with my realization in listening to a lot of conversation about fragmentation over the last year or so when it's become very, very popular to talk about. Most of the time when people are talking about it, they don't mean what we think they mean. They mean things are getting complicated. It's just a it's a statement about complexity. And that resonated when were talking about how the Internet used to be or is and is still very US centric, but that's changing. So it feels like fragmentation, but maybe what it is is there's just of plurality of approaches to content and other things like that for better or worse. Right? So that was just my comment. But then I'd add a question to you or to others. This comes actually from the Gaia session earlier today. There's a really interesting presentation on not just companies that are dominating the US, but even when you have supposedly a global network for your content distribution. all of the traffic is still going through the US. So they're talking about, like, the fact that there are very few pees in the continent of Africa, for example, and if you're in one country and the content you're requesting is in the same country, it's still highly likely that your traffic is going all the way around the world and back again. And we couldn't, in the Gaia conversation, nobody really had a good answer as to why because it seems more efficient. There are all these kinds of incentives that we would think would exist to keep content local when possible irrespective of whether or not there's a mandate for content localization, which is something that's trend as well. And so coming up with actual incentives and trying to solve that problem might"

I I have so many thoughts on that. So I have 2 dueling observations. 1st, obviously, there's a tremendous strategic advantage to having all the traffic route through your This shouldn't need to be said. But, yes, there's tremendous number of metadata and other things and reasons why you might want traffic throughout through you. Now here's another interesting observation. let's say that there exists some country that doesn't have any kind of boomerang whatsoever. In fact, such country exists. China has very little boomerang routing. you send a packet domestically from China to China, it will route only through China and it will not go internationally at all. And the reason is that China only has 3 ASs that that connected to Internet. It's called a great bottleneck of Chime. analogy to the Great Farm. So they're they're some great work on kind of how that's architected and how those AS's work and why they work. But one really interesting thing is that it creates this asymmetry in when it comes to hacking Internet infrastructure. So it's often assumed or presumed that no one would ever dare attack something like a DNS server or a content distribution network because doing so would be too much that would cause too much blowback for the attacker. You know, if you were to go and and attack something, you you would for the consequences to such a great degree, it wouldn't be worth the attack. But the absence of any boomerang routing actually makes that calculus look a lot different. There is absolutely no incentive to go in against you know, lever leveraging some kind of attack against the CDN. if you don't rely on that CDN and if that outage in that CDN wouldn't affect you. Those kinds of asymmetries are actually very powerful, and we need should absolutely be cognizant of them when we think about what it means for the Internet to be stable globally. stable Internet means some kind of balance between boomerang routing perhaps and and not. there's some notion of sovereignty that needs to be balanced against interdependence. And this is actually mimicked in debates about trade throughout the 20th century. There was kind of thesis of globalization that interdependence would put would prevent conflict because that interlinkage exactly."

But this is a good segue you finished on on sovereignty because In fact, what we see is a lot of concerns on fragmentation coming from let's say, regulation, hyperregenerization. So how regulations including the EU is Under the name of we'd call it strategy economy. how they actually weaponizing a number of a number of assets that are going to really have a problem at the end. So, for example, take Dora, for example, the new what you call the Digital Operational Resignancy Act. that is really about cat Providers, the FSI sector. So So my question here is is is to be underrepresented into your presentation.

You know, it's it's something I I'm really fascinated by So, no, it was not the Gaia project because I don't think this one is going anywhere. I think it was the other one which is the Dora Dora. d o r a. another so so how the EU is weaponizing its instruments. to let's say, precisely to fight US. Okay. In certain ways. So it it goes it goes down to even we're organizing its auditing capabilities to the FSI so that they are less incentivized to go for US Companies on what they do. Right. Yeah. So, you know, there's this theory in political science called hegemonic stability theory. And and really, it should probably be called something more like hegemonic openness theory. But the idea is that in global trade and it I think it was the late 18th century into 20th century, you know, Britain and then followed by the US. There's this hedge amount of the basic we ran world trade and into the 21st century with the financial system, more or less, this is true of the US and then the Internet. I'd argue. you the Internet also acts sort of as this hedge month. And the puzzle behind this theory is, like, okay. There's this Hadjimon. So why do we see this to be as open as it is. Why is it that a hedgehogon can dominate the system? And yet, you know, there's still this open and free trade. Why is it that a hedge amount can dominate this Internet? there's still this open and somewhat global flow of data. And this theory that has a pretty satisfying explanation through this phenomenon, which is basically that long as the hedge amount exists, it actually benefits the hedge amount to have a very open system. cause in that situation, everyone else can kind of do whatever they want and that you you know, the the hedge them on whoever they are gets to benefit from their central position and and extract some rent basically from that central position."

What if they end up really challenging the hedge fund in a real and lasting way, such that, you know, in this case, the US no longer is the Edgemont over the Internet. What does the Internet look like Well, hegemonic stability theory, I'd say. It wouldn't then and necessarily be a very open Internet. That may be counter to some of our expectations. That may be counter to some of probably ideological preferences. But this is the prediction of that theory. And, you know, if we observe something else, it would be a serious challenge to that theory, which is more or less you know, proved out at least in in Trade And And Finance. So what are we to make of this? Well, you know, my overall kind of fear is that the Internet is both something countries fight on and over. meaning it's country it's something that the a country is used to struggle against one another. a a mechanism for for international kind of competition cooperation. but it's also something that nations struggle to control. It it's a domain of conflict as well as a mechanism for for conflict and competition. So you know, as this plays out, we'll kind of see if there is a way challenging this hedge month. And if there is a way of challenging the hedge month, does that decrease the openness or stability of the Internet.

What's identity? You're not gonna get agreement on that. that that just seems You you might have an idea of it, and I think you've seen sort of the tip of the iceberg. And the iceberg looks You know, this thing you see is big and complicated. Right? But you're only seeing 10% of everything that's going on. sure. I'm willing to acknowledge that our our For understanding of the situation may be very different from those who have been immersed space for a very long period of time. I'm confident or I'm hopeful rather that, like, we have the technical chops of, like, trying to dig into like, like, widely used credential mechanisms and try to make sense to them. perhaps will not be so successful. But, you know, I guess, time was off with if this program proceeds. So -- So I'm just trying to understand. Are you like, you say there is a lot of work in there. It's there's probably also a lot of problems, and we definitely don't try to solve them all, but trying to figure out if there is anything we can do in this community to help the problems. Or are you saying we shouldn't even try? a lot of people are solving on their problems. I think just trying to get a layout of what's happening opening identity, is a massive workout effort. right, before you can even figure out where are there problems to solve."

There's out thousands of people have been working on identity for a long time. and just the scope of trying to understand the lay of the land. that that just seems hard to do in What is the identity and credentials? Right? That just that that first part seems tough. To to give it sort of perhaps, like, a did you wanna reply to that? to give a, like, a kind of concrete example. So I mentioned the the OAuth example earlier, there are a number of, like, very, very similar technologies, like privacy pass, go off, verifiable credentials, all these are kind of doing very similar things in the circumstances in which would you use them, how they're used, why perhaps why they're misused or, like, we wanted presents sort of like a clear picture for for like, the relationship between these types of things, or that's one of the goals at least. proposals. I mean, the this is why I have concerns. You just listed three things that to my mind are very different than you think they overlap with each other. They definitely overlap. a WAF overlaps with -- But are you like, I think we need to have this discussion in the program. or are you saying you don't even wanna have the discussion? Let's take let's take it offline. Let's go through the q for now. It it it -- Yeah. I'm not even sure. I just it just comes across a little naive. like, this is way more complicated than what you're phrasing, and almost all of your descriptions, are kind of come across. I'm I'm glad you're at the OAuth meeting. Right? But can have kind of overlaps what they'll want. Sure. So, yeah, I just wanna say I I feel like we need to have discussion. And if the end of the discussion is we can't do anything here. We are closing the program. We're done. Yeah. I just worry about the the having a discussion on this is probably a you know, a whole an off there's an awful lot of work in trying to have a discussion that's actually gonna conclude."

    "text": "Okay. Thanks, Dave. Peter Castleman, I'm working on Standard's most linear oauth area. And so very excited to see this. I think this is great. In terms of the questions around scope, you know, I think if we think about this program as a kind of point to bring different communities together, to exchange ideas, I think that's actually really helpful. because otherwise, I find myself sort of traveling from working working group to figure out what is it that you're doing and how does that fit with what I'm doing? And is there an opportunity. So I think as an integration point and the kind of clearing House for those conversations, that's really Really good. know, I think you might wanna think about defining, you know, whether it's credential or identity system think about maybe framing it in terms of the outcome that you want with identity systems. Right? So with an identity system, often the goal is something along the lines of making sure that the right person has access to the right thing at the right time. And that actually then opens up the conversation about all the technology building blocks that you need. to Brent's earlier comment about big eye, might be yet another. Right? If you can focus on the technology pieces, that's helpful but also then It just helps us structure the conversation because to Dick's point, it's a big, big topic. Right? And then on the second one, my perspective there, I identity goes well beyond humans from my perspective, at least, we're seeing so much challenges around managing devices workloads, And this conflag configuration rate, what you mentioned, oh, you're using an IP address, which is an identifier for advice on the network. for a human. Well, maybe some of that's because we didn't maybe we don't have proper human identity systems, but maybe we also don't have proper systems for machine identity. And so we end up sort of merging these things inappropriately."

I mean, I think as I I'm one of the other slides. Like, bringing people together either in the form of a workshop or in the program itself to have these discussion is is like, one of our one of the goals that was, like, primarily identified, and we didn't explicitly list sort of the use cases that we would want to target and and or to help used to frame these discussions because we were hoping that, you know, the contributors who do come and facilitate and or contribute to these discussions, but kind of bring the use cases that are important to them. authentication authentication being, like, perhaps the most obvious one. But, yeah, I think using it as, like, the, you know, the integration point for all these different communities is a perfectly reasonable way to think about this. So Yep. And then just hoping beyond human identity would be would help that conversation at time. Sure. And it would it would be a shame if there was, like, you know, effectively forks of, like, know, people thinking about the same topic just with different I guess, like, you know, this is the human group. This is the this is the machine identity group or whatever. we have to be cognizant of, like, you know, trying to make like, meaningful forward progress and, like, have productive conversations. So I I perhaps with some right balance, we can we can increase the scope, but I is the risk of, like, just slowing things down by just trying to do at all the things. Sure. All all depends on the outcome you want. Of course. course. Of course. But Yeah. Martin Thompson. When I suggested that we'd limit this to talking about humans, on the list. I I think a number of people jumped down my throat. understand that I this is an IB program that you're proposing here, and there's there's always the possibility that we can really sort of get into the weeds and have a very broad scope on anything. So I think that's Certainly something that that that that"

And my sort of goal here is to ensure that when we talk about these things, we have something more of a focus on for instance, the the effect that the the systems that we're talking about have on people opposed to the machines. So back to Peter's example of the IP address using a proxy for an identifier for a person. That's a really great example of something, and I think we should be talking about. But I don't care about the IP address as a proxy for identifying a server. or or something, a piece of machinery. because I I think that broadening the scope in that particular way would be just to mean, we already heard. It's an ocean that we're look we're looking to boil with a magnifying glass I size it is, I I would rather not get too far into into the other things. I'm I'm also surprised that no one has mentioned the identity layer of the Internet yet. and I wanted to be the first. think that's not necessary. But I just wanted to be the first. So that's all I have to say. Yeah. Thanks, Martin. that the the name despite being kinda cute, I guess, for the program has human oriented particularly because that was, like, the the primary focus. But I I that said, like, I'm personally not opposed to expanding the scope, I think it makes good arguments as to, you know, why where we should place our focus to start. Oh, yeah. Please go ahead.

About 3 years ago, I did work for our clients to identify all all identity standards in SDOs and other industry associations that I could related to human centric identity, and I identified 1500 of them. Okay? So when he's saying the scope of what you're trying to do, just the sense making part, Oh, sure. Yeah. So is significant. No disagreement there. I I anticipate, like, there's going to be a no like, 1500 was a lot a bit higher of a number than I was expecting? now. the actual ones that are used in practice, like I mean, we're gonna have to try to keep things small to start and just focus on some pretty important ones.

I also think we can't completely you know, think Martin's point was was good and that you were gonna maybe focusing on machines is not the right thing to do, but there's gonna have to be some aspect of that because more and more in There's just a lot of work in that area.

Or what can we, as the IETF do in this space. I think that's interesting. I think there are enough other identity focused standards organizations that are looking at scale that I know you said you didn't wanna take the energy from the room, but you're gonna find to tell the same people. So coming at it with a bit more focus to what can you accomplish here would be very helpful. Great. That seems to be, like, a pretty unanimous comment that we're getting. So that seems like perfectly good feedback to fold into the proposed charter. Yeah. I mean, also, an IV program is not like a work do. Right? We are trying to figure out to identify what we what the work is we can be doing, and, like, the reason why we're creating a program is because we, on the IV, are not all identity experts. We need to have the discussion with the identity experts, which are not member of the IAB, and so that's why we're proposing a program. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Christina.

And we assume that some observations would would take place in that they'd be limited by locality. And there was, you know, some positive network management benefit to observation in terms of understanding network performance and quality of service and even even some security benefits as well in terms of you know, looking for various forms of attacks. It was still subject a lot of this was still subject to abuse, obviously, we saw some service providers and some behaviors we didn't like in the IETF, and and there were grumblings about that. And in fact, I would say speedy sort of had its beginnings through those grumblings. Yeah. Next slide, please. they what we found was an attacker that had near infinite resources. in the form of an n s in in the NSA. And we couldn't really quantify losses reason we couldn't quantify losses is because, well, you know, how do you modify something that the NSA has gotten in terms of into, you know, you know, their visibility.

I think it's 7258. and it led to a lot more encryption on the Internet. Next slide, please. So RFC 9446 reflects on a lot of things. It reflects, first of all, on how it was at the time. So Bruce talks a little bit in this about what it was like to report the story, and almost describes what what we you come away thinking he has PTS deal a little bit, and you read his really well written essay, And but it's it's something worth reading because there was a human cost to reporting the story in the first place. Steven Farrell talks about our response more tactically as well as It made me a little bit culturally. Then Farzana Body talks about the human rights implications or in some case you know, where we made advances and where we really, we have an gone as far as perhaps she would have liked. and why? And then Steve Della, then puts us all in a a historical perspective. You almost get a get the feeling of You know, all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again.

Is there are are there things we could do better if if we have these sorts of events in the future. What accomplishments did we achieve? What is left to be done by us or by others? Right? And then how has the threat environment evolved since then? So for instance, a good example of that will come up in just a moment. Now a hint to you as a community, The Internet the the independent submissions editor always asks the question, by the way, why is this document important? If you come to me with a document and you can't that question, you're going back empty handed. Next slide, please. Okay. So Couple of key points. First of all, Nothing happened overnight. other than Outreach. when we were in the word it took a lot of time, a lot of commitment, a lot of effort a lot of consensus and a lot of code to get things done. in terms of change. It was a c change within the community but it took time for that sea change to take effect. The second point I wanna make is that It was helped, I think, also, that there were there was opportunity seen in terms of certain players saw that there was opportunity to benefit from improved security, and they took advantage of that. So they have we caught a tailwind off of that as a community. But a key point here I'll say is that A lot of the data that we're concerned about is still accessible. A lot of the it's maybe accessible to in in concentrated form in fact. And so even in the short term, if an attacker knows where to attack, they may get more information than the NSA got."

Of course, I'm an IoT person, so I'd have to say that. So these are things to think about Next slide, please. last one's a little bit of an advertisement. Right? was an important document I think to do, and I'd like the community to consider it you know, even talk about it. I wish I could be there to talk with you about it. in terms of how we how we performed what we can do better, you know, what we did well Right? And and that threat model is something we should always stay focused on. And what's the next biggest problem? And You've talked about centralization and fragmentation today. just a hint, you'll be seeing a little bit of a a little bit of work coming out along the lines of centralization real soon now. My priorities that I've taken on are those three things, and I take I I've used them extensively. If you submit something as for an independent submission, of course, It won't be a standard, and it won't have community consensus, but doesn't necessarily mean it's uninteresting. might be very interesting, and I think you'll find this document is And that's it. very much.
