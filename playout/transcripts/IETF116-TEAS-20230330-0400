There's still an open item with respect to bidirectional parts. And once that is resolved, the plan is to take this through a second working look last call. Along with the t types update document. The last document that I would like to cover in this deck is on slide twenty two. This the t young document the status of this is very similar to that of the previous one. We took twenty nine revision twenty nine through work a last call.

But operators passed requirement for management transactions since everything is centralized to get some information about the type of. We noticed that there are name gene that he model and maybe they used. We look at that we say maybe used but is not very clear. And also we don't understand what is the value of the cost which is it's associated with the name. So the current approach is that maybe we can clarify these as is as a the qualification here as an issue, and or we can get more input. That will be okay. Next. Next slide, please.

I even mixed feeding. It looks the same but not exactly the same. So the idea is that to try to the to to align the raft with the most the common the deploy use case, but to try to make generic is possible. So we will look in the text and see whether we can generalize it or not. And next slide is. So What are the major difference? Okay? The individual difference is right with respect to the previous case when you create to support an ip in optical path you have to create instead of an anita ethernet client service a transparent client service to the optical. This the part that can be easily be visualize. The other problem is that this this service is starting from phase. From an S which is on the, so we don't have any of policy to expose the linked between the optical network and the Ip network that's the part where we are make sure that the test can be easily generalized Next? Okay. Okay. Next step, sir, okay. This document is almost getting ready for working group passcode school. And but is limiting scope and there are Efforts some discussion, we we do new drops coming up. And we have some discussion with operators and contribute and then thus contributing to these effort that we noticed that among the things that have not been addressed in this first step, the two major items that can be useful for the next steps are on one side, the service assurance.

Other items here mean that the traffic there is no need to go through at number four, for example, we had a site discussion as well. There was you might remember in the previous one fifteen, there was a question whether or not we have to address potential custom power event we want to... Our customer wants to create a request It net slash. There was a discussion that yes, it is good idea to have it. This was some discussion but it's the best way to do it and some changes that added the model to address that from the potential use cases. They might not be the valid or very high Kelly will use gets at this time, but we thought that it might be a good idea to add just for the completeness in the future if somebody wants to use that one, it is possible to do its optional obviously asleep but it's possible do. And the rest I guess no need to go through that. We can go to a next slide. Now I'll go through a couple of items which are important and interesting.

Since there is a model it might be a good idea to to that model a proposal one is trying to say that it is possible to use that model depends on the scenario, obviously. If a customer the that is a still draft, but if it goes through eventually we can create an Ac as a service and in our model, we can use it for example. On proposal number two rounds since our model is technology, like we didn't want on purpose prove anything as specific to any protocol called bg related or any other thing which is implied, our model is model specific from that aspect, we don't have them, but if it is possible if somebody wants to do it you know each should be possible to use from us store. So this this the basically the framework. There are a couple of young model that we've I put year for the completeness that I refer met discussed that before. But in summary, the proposal is we are going to use either of the tree ups approaches a b or c Aes. We already have the the Ac some of the technology agnostic attribute in our model if somebody wants to use that depends on the application, those might be enough. So they can use it.

I see Adrian and think previously Greg on the queue. Maybe you can take questions you Okay. For Adrian, please. Things Adrian Channel. Quick question about which of these approaches in the proposal might cause us to get blocked waiting for other documents to to go through. Actually none of them because The only thing is the option b if that Ac that draft go through and become Rfp it is possible to do all these our possibility.

I I think that the further whether the ac has to be configured as a service or not as a service is... I see that it's more associated with the realization. It depends on how the network is done. From the customer perspective, I don't know whether I should not care whether you requires a new service model or not a new service model to be set up They're the... You're. Right. But the whole idea is we try to keep that technology nature of the model. But from for that, a specific reason, we didn't add any of those she through the model because otherwise it fit the purpose. So since the the number, the option number b it's still a a proposal you know, the model is not, you know, finalized yet. You have a valid point, but at the time that we reached to that And for some reason that model makes sense to use it, we can use so this is a possibility to do and this the reason that there is an option that if you want to explore. Okay. Maybe we can look at the more. It just maybe we can have a... A... This model that we And then the specific, but you need you can be done by augmentation that we can discuss you know, then walking that. Okay. Know that comment on the top proposal we discussed offline about some of the issue with current solution we need to look at also in the context of another presentation, how to address better address the requirement to have a customer top in the contest Yeah.

So from that aspect, obviously our model is agnostic to how the natural slice is realized. But since it's it mentioned in the framework, and there was some question at least a couple of them here that I heard about, how This applies to N mba, I just put this one as a completeness but where they are also basically.

But 3g p does is very focused on the needs of radio and has very clear and specific news in the radio environment, which are very relevant. And I'm not arguing that they did something wrong there. They didn't they did what they needed for the radios?

And these applications that you will see here and if we connectivity or network wholesale services and so forth are clearly defining the framework document One of the application is five g slicing. And today, it seems that this is the most important application of the network slicing. But going forward, obviously, the framework would that be designed is applicable to other application as well. But the in specific This is the driver are going to discuss. The in, at Item nine fourteen, it was this say that that there were major a few documents that we had at create a single one. So this is that single document that we started in the Ip one and fourteen, we continue in one hundred and fifty and we are going to go the second revision, but if you go to next slide, it is important to consider how this draft relates to to bunch of other draft that we have other idea. I think we put this one as a kind of visual image of the correlation between draft If you look at this one, the the first tree are basically the framework Model and everything which discussed about Network as a general a generic generic framework text technology."

So the going forward, I'm going to talk about the the orange on and after crystal is going to talk about the very below on left hand side. So this is a correlation if you see group up drive in that context, so we are gonna to make sure that we are all clear about what we want to do. So since you are going to the next slide, The only thing which is important in this pitch is the detail obviously is important. You can take a look at your leisure later. But we try to merge three documents in the context of 5g and it try to basically go through various the areas of the mapping, realization and how straight to 3g gp and left hand right hand. So this is the architecture of the 3g p they have or registration at the very top values controller. They use net like manager function that top and network service like function which in our basically orchestra at the top and group of controller in the middle. The only thing you like to to ask is everything which is related to transport connectivity and we use It network to do that So we try to address this one if you go through the draft the will clearly put that phone also the mapping that should happen if the traffic from data path arise from for example, rand domain to the Ups domain"

We pointed to the christ of draft here. There is another way to do a Dm has another way when we want to do it.

The medication point could be on p it or the c so number one two three four, again, christ com. You will see more detailed information about that. But the idea here is the in specific for five g, when we want to defined it network slice There that the point should be.

If you take a look at the draft is describing that and if you go to a companion drive vicious the drive again, is going through all the detail of that we have to consider the map happening between five g, the net lies and what is the you know, best way to do it. This is the possibility to do, but depends on the operators, they might choose you know, one of them. And the as I mentioned, each one has a pros cost and just put an additional next slide if you go to have one nick the level of detail.

Just for the sake of our discussion, I assume is network function one and two and this network is described as a mid. If you go to the cloud run, this is the the basic architecture of the through the a interface, and they try to deplete here that there are some mapping that should happen between three Pediatric model and S that we have how we can take that from and generate the N model that we are and there are different flavors if there is one connectivity that yellow or we have the dual connectivity.

Here's Sister Sa from Networks. On behalf of the I we present the updates on the realization have network slides for five networks. Next slide. So basically, the overall approach and goes of the auto for this is to the main goal is to what to what extent. You know, Lies can be implemented using current Ip pass technologies. So without completed the wheel so in the transport network we use already since aegis I don't know Vpn, profiles traffic tools, etcetera, etcetera. So how can we reuse these tools? Or how can you use these tools to provide the basically transport connectivity for 5g slices So this is the this is the main idea. To provide the reference to document approaches to the place such such technologies. So that that's that's a main data. So which means we are not doing here revolution of the transport network where some evolution. So that's my there.

So we are talking about network functions to net functions end end beta path segmentation of this is data path we cover later a little bit more details. Then we are this discussing here It and non It of orchestration domains manta. So when we have two end network functions, could be for example, a C u to Ups doesn't necessarily mean that And entire data file between C Ups is controlled by Ii network nice controller. Okay. So I will cover that later on in more data here. And were where It network lies fits into this picture. The different hand metals between the runs see ran network domain. To the to main so he talking about a hand off phase so we can Ip addressing or mp, whatever. How to realize the transport 5g slices in current available technologies So here, we are talking about the traffic engineering tools about some Qs profiles in in which places in the network.

So basically, We have more discussion regarding five network slicing versus transport network slicing So we have here the technology transport network which is used by 3g gp, You know, Device that the entire network free main domains on the high level We have run domain transport network domain and and the domain. And then from It slicing perspective, you are focusing on on the 3g transfer network domain. So here we have some data discussions regarding the being say how come up five g network networks slicing with the task when it slice. Has that it's possible as well to have five network slicing without currently slicing the transport network, So we could have for such implementation as well. So it's more discussion that we enhanced the discussion comparing to the previous version of the draft. And then we have very detailed discussion of network international path So basically, we could have different kind of metal functions from realization perspective you could have physical network function or visualize network crashing, or compact. When we have physical net function, but typically, this physical networking function physical box directly connected to our trans network to So Pe and we have found from this.

And then what we have we see different discussions with different operators that the It network networks nice responsive consuming with this basically the slicing inside of one other network structure.

And then when when realized the network was nice over the Ip p. Their realization should be independent on whether the use case is 5g or something yes so it looks like to me a combination of two statements. One for five g to slides and one from pm and that that other than having all the possible combination would be much better for me to have a more modular application.

The figure the immediately it is more or less the the economical figure that is in the the effect documents or having identity that for less that interact with and network control for reinforcing the slice configuration.

So the main purpose of this is to identify gaps or if identify aspects that could not be covered with potential level models is such a way that we could need to figure out how what what could be the way of calling that if we want to enforce. So whatever parameter that could come from the Mba young model. For instance, the availability is is part of the Nba model is not it's specifically considering the network models who would need to figure out how to yeah.

Doesn't because it could be yes. Did different man for the... I was trying to understand how is possible to show. Better to to ask the fact that these are portions of a same line. Well, this is someone though orchestrate to that that this belongs to one is somewhere at orchestration level yes. From the realization perspective, if I I don't know I deploy some Profiles here some peers profiles here. It's not visible from that perspective. But at the orchestration levels it needs to be shown Okay. So we're gonna try some here, we're gonna the back queue is gonna be without without pre registration, the front one will be with people who get into properly and the the people are in queue properly get preference. Okay. Come on. It it... It's okay. I want to ask for that. Remember, I does own the slices. The five g owns the slices. So they're gonna have a higher level were they gonna see the end to end? And they're can allow budget and allocation between f one new n three and unit So we only see the segments. But the higher level was gonna see the full and. Yeah. Network slash level, we don't even know if this is one and free or whatever. You just got some request which said requirements, and that's it. Okay. Let let let me put it in context. The so I'm The. I'm asking the Ns for for this type of this type of life and I understand that that from then I below, no one knows that the three pieces go together good"

Can I can answer the question that you have Danny also? Exactly as the mentioned mean two. Sorry about that. Yes. Yeah. Then that's me there. I think people ask you about the Q mapping here. So if you look at the the three data place here, You are going to have the mapping front for the Q model and then you get some marking and the inside Ip header. And then on that part, now suppose for the downstream before three. Going to have the mapping to the five q. Yes. That's right. And then you're going to put that information into the the Pd session container within the Gdp and you gave another Udp Ip So I want there but not finally not package reach the transport of the Ip, how can you do the mapping those information are already deeply inside you know, I gotta to know. So so the assumption what is described in in the draft as well that five Q is mapped to today Cp. So we see only the city We yeah. Understand part, but the thing who's going to do the mapping to the that's that's on the run side of our sides with only Jean pierre, for example, a Ups is do this mapping to The I know see is map to Scp sap So we see only dc. Okay. Sure. Thank you. So we close the decision now as taking these discussions to the list and also you've now have in half an hour we come back. So so you can keep Thank you much. Thank you. Thank you all for good. Thank you. An hour kinda"
