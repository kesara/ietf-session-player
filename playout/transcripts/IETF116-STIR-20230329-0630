Gonna hear about how those were sorted out in a few minutes. And what we're trying to decide today when we talk about service provider ob b is is the... Is has the feedback we've gotten adequate and or is it ready to pass to the Isp and we have some documents where we have no updates, but there's been recent list discussions. So make sure that those discussions continue. Then, like I said, we have an agenda that we had previously test on the list. These are the things we're gonna focus on. And there's two pages exactly. The first half of the agenda is dealing with the documents that we have already passed on to the Is in the second half is the things that we're still working on.

And then I mentioned that one of the reasons we originally had that being more generic If we had in mind, that someone might embed logo with her other thing and the in the actual sip request and refer to the body part using a Url. Right. Now I realized if we were to allow that we probably need to say something about security considerations and as the person who brought it up, I think I would be okay if we just an h to p for now. Anyone decides they really need to do. Yeah. The use case, they can update the document. But if if anyone else who was actually planning to use the cid or something other than these Gps to reference a logo or icon, then they should say pretty quickly. Yeah.

I think from what I've heard from other industry folks that's generally, you know, you will use Cdn and other things to deliver images. That only makes sense.

Good afternoon. Alright. Stir for messaging so exciting. We actually got this one out of the working group. It went to the Is, that's usually what we're trying to accomplish here. But for those who have not been following this work with all of the rigor and attention that that mean the chairs and Chris and few other people do. This is basically a draft about leveraging the work we've done on star for text and multimedia in messages. Why we wanna do that? Well, I understand message spam is becoming increasingly a problem, In part caused by us The fact that is becoming harder to spoof and create spam with the telephone network, with ordinary calls and so we're seeing increases in this that are going in exactly the opposite direction from the decreases. We've been getting in actual call spam. And, you know, like, Message fan, it's a problem. It's not it's not the biggest problem in the world. In part because there are some reasonable mitigation strategies for it, like just analytics bay and analysis right of tech content as it goes through service bureaus, that's very common in the. Us. Of course, the problem is there's a bit of a sea change happening messaging these days, especially messaging comes from telephones, and that is"

Is being deployed in like lots of nation states around the world now that we could leverage for this. So yeah, that's what this does. Next slide, please. So it went it's currently on the Ballot. We got some gus is still. I put in a lot of fixes after the zero seven. Following the Is review, certainly, Roman and others had some pretty good catches in there, including places. I'd like totally loved Rf numbers embarrassing things like that that are now rectified. But based on a discussion, I did not attend yesterday, that I will I guess give what p I have learned talking to two witnesses. So two witnesses, eye to this event who were present have given me the information that I'll be giving you now. There's really two big things we need to fix in zero ways. So there will be a zero eight of this shortly. One is to use this cozy ready in order to describe the algorithms that we're using to create hash for this new message I claim element that we put in. And this will just enable us to better manage algorithm agility on the off chance. We need to swap things out later. This is totally fine. With there was another proposal maybe we should create our own registry and use that here and that why would I bother to do that? There's plenty of great stuff out there. And the second thing is that we're were add some new language to the introduction. That basically is gonna clarify that there is indeed some norma guidance in this draft, a smidge in.

The reason why there's a ton of informative guidance in this document, is because as with all of the specifications we produce here, There are in fact other standards bodies that take these and go do things with them. And they have their own profiles and their own use cases, and everything else like that And so we kinda wanna sketch what we think that space is. That some national standards body or international group not to point fingers and anyone in particular. Might wanna utilize this for with out placing too many constraints on what they get to do. And I think once those are handled, we should be done. There a third eye witness to this conversation that would like to corroborate? That my understanding, what we need to do is correct with it. Murray, three. listening. Yeah. Sorry I wasn't Yeah. So that's what gonna do to fix this. Those basically those two things. There was another matter actually that was just brought up right before the meeting by my friend Jonathan. This is Ben. I'm actually in you before you leave the house. Okay. Why are you say on this? The... I'm actually not coming on this. I'm coming on rc. I should have put it there. Does the Rc need to reference the same cozy registry? The our the hash for our Cdi and Rt Perfect. Thank you so much for raising that then. So certainly we could. And and to be clear, the message I syntax inscription was just lifted, forklift entirely out of how we described rc. Right? So in the interest of consistency across the store standards, probably should. Sounds like kind of a hassle though. But fortunately, Chris, Chris would be writing that.

Maybe being a bit more prescriptive about how to create the mind bodies for for Message I. Just for cases where natively messages were not already encoded in mind, and there isn't like a standard transformation, one would use to get those into mine. Maybe we could say just a couple words. And again, I don't wanna be too prescriptive because there's like bunch of things out there that behave even a bunch of different ways. And you know, I know that there is S p p to mime stuff because of the email to Sms gateways that exist and things like that.

I just wanted to clarify on the registry because I didn't mention it to you that and maybe your this is obvious, but you should have some text that it's says only the hash algorithms. Right. Yeah. We don't mean all the algorithms that are in cozy. I mean, I think mentioned that. Yeah, we're really just stealing their tokens. Think to be blunt. Like we almost don't even care what the semantics are behind the token. This is just a place where if you need tokens that are gonna be that prefix. We're gonna stick in there. We're saying those are symptomatic. Like what you would find in the C registry. And that also... The the other advantage to actually point to that is that Cozy already has some stuff built in that explains like the perceived weakness or strength of these algorithms, which we allude to and a totally wavy way today.

Way back at the dawn of time before there was stir back in the dark days of a protocol design that did not work. Called R forty four seventy four. My guy by the name of John L l. Wrote a very helpful document called Rf forty nine sixteen. That answered a fundamental question about Stu that we did not about forty seventy four. We not really think about much at the time, which is how do you make it work in the backwards direction? And part of the issue around all desks says that you know, we can sign... Today when we think about Stir, we think it only signs in like invites. Right, It's like uni. Nobody cares about any other requests being signed with. But in actuality, if you did want to figure out who the party was on the other did the call who the call was in a secure way you needed some way to attach a passport for a message that would just to come in the backwards direction. Problem with that is, of course, if there is any re retargeting that happens anything that changed who it was we're trying to reach That party would not have a credential that would be able to answer to what the original two was in the request. And there's some other historical stuff I went bore people with about how you do transaction and dialogue matching, things like that. They go back to Rf. Twenty five forty three that we rem in three two sixty one, but nobody where they listen to closely enough. So this this this required a lot of work in this really complicated new option tag that John created that was called from change. So why have I gotten interested in this? Well, if you look at this second set of bullets up here. There are a set of security vulnerabilities that are sent, not certainly in the original stir threat model, but people have started thinking about in connection with the protections that Stir provides. And the good example of this is just a forge by. In a request. Right? If you wanted to do a denial of service and tear down a request,"

And so we actually fix the charter. To put it into a space or we could do this. And you know, I'd spent a ton of time Next slide, trying to figure out okay, how do we get this like from change thing to work? At the previous, I decided to just blow all that up and not bother dealing with change anymore at all. And I proposed a new passport type and that passed type is Rs. It only appears in sip responses. So now a passport can be carried in provisional responses in one eighty or one eighty three, is good for early media cases, as well as the two hundred okay. And I just said, hey, reason why I think this works is because the way that we have seen stir and while overall sit these days deployed. With all the Sb and things like it in the world. I'm not that concerned about the routing issues around all this, and it seems likely that any way that you send quest responses will come back through effectively the same entities. And so I decided to basically behave the same way that D did and it'll work really, really well in a sunny day case. What you're concerned about, for example is a route attack. Where I am trying to send a request like to my bank. To start conversation with my banker. I will get a positive affirmation that yes, you reached Bank of America in the backwards direction that comes to me. I can validate it. I can be sure that this is a secure channel.

I think this is a prerequisite all any kind of any kind of strip tagging paying on one. So chris, I I I think that's actually a really good point, but I think we can punt it to just be a Sip application that you know, handles the response and you know, maybe specify something in the future, but... Yeah. I mean, Mean so there's a lot of stuff in there as well that just says, look, know, these these provisional responses I'm talking about are, they're not even reliable. They can be dropped for like, any number of reasons and not actually come back and reach the ui that originated transaction. Right? And so I'm just like, look, it doesn't work. Doesn't work. Like... So it's kinda... It's kinda best effort. And the only thing that I think really can mitigate that or create the proper experience is that there is some again, a critical button you can push that says for this kind of call it is really important to me that this work. And if it doesn't, I don't want the calls to be set up. But that that's almost that's entirely you asked like no bid on the wire that I think would would would have anything like the efficacy that that has because that's actually the expression user are preference for critical in this case.

And, you know, someday, maybe before we die, everything will be set. Or we gonna replaced by something better than But you know, so we started developing a fall back plan. The original version of this draft called fall back that define something called the call placement service call placement service is somewhere you can stick a passport And any service that would like to rely on Can consult a call placement this in order to be able to recover a passport. On the off chance it's just somewhere in the transit a call, it gets discarded. It started as a a lovely sip invite hit a Pstn gateway, all like got cut even a yard of Pstn in the middle right would be enough or a policy at an That's just like, I'm stripping all the sudden identity you had. Sorry. Could make this not work. So our notion was to have a fall back and that's what the Cps is Now. Our regional assumptions in that treated the Cps as an un third party service. A lot of ruby brilliant work that is over my head that he would have to explain himself here to demonstrate ways that you could kind of blind any third party service to privacy impacted information that it could learn in this instance. And so what we've done in the service provider Ob draft is look at an alternative use case for this, where really it's the service providers itself that are operating these Cps or maybe some vendors like operating it under contract to them on their behalf. But in other words entities that see the calling and called party number anyway. Because they received the call signal it. Right? So there's no revelation of anything to them that they don't already know."

So, yeah, we had a working last group last call for this. There weren't a ton of comments, but our are not taker. Thank you, Simon. Sent actually some very useful comments after the It meeting in London. Most of which focused on the concept in the draft that is called the Cps advertisement. And the idea behind this is in a system where you aren't pre provisioned to understand, okay. This is how I find the Cps. I'm going to send passports to for a terminating service provider. Is there some way I could discover it? And so we created this concept in the draft of a Cps advertisement, which is basically a Json that is signed with a store credential saying, hey, for my service provider code or whatever, Here's the or by. And those advertisements could be shared through ride things we didn't really really wanna be prescriptive about that. We just want to make sure there was a six your way that leverage the Pk I that stir already created. That you could then bind your particular implementation to you know, from the Sb that's in your certificate, document signing thing saying for this, go to this Url. And Simon had a bunch of comments about well, we should probably be clear if you're using and yet, the the calling party has no way to convert a call telephone number into what the Sp should be probably a problem. So that's now kind of noted as a defect of this. I think a lot of places can anywhere that we have like an impact we do in the united States and we run the service for the That's called pathfinder.

Because really if you look at the contents of the Tn list in a cert and here refer to mister H who helped us out a great deal with getting that syntax correct. You know, this just kind of like a bucket of these things. Right? Appear there. And they use something called A and entry value to differentiate whether they represent ns sp, a single telephone number or a telephone number range. And so samantha proposal was well, Okay?

Certainly, if you take the concept of the Cps and couple it from the service providers that way. And instead, and I'm saying this, mostly for records benefits, we can appreciate what design is over there.

And are still the same for these particular operators that use them in the operating company numbers and the united States where we deploy this. But for telephone numbers, you have telephone numbers or telephone number ranges that are baked into these certificates Something like it's a little dodge because of things like number of portability or just people that have number of inventories that are for whatever reason dynamic, very large enterprises that may change number ranges on that stuff. So if you bake sir, how do you know if you're in a verification us at the time you're looking at this cert, okay, is this telephone number still in the scope of authority of the serve that signed this passport. This a little tricky. And so we looked at a couple of approaches here and the two high level ones that we've gravitate towards are using the online certificate status protocol the, p using short lived cert and there are a lot of sub subdivision here. Next slide. So Simon Castle colleague like Jack regard to. Jack, are you actually on you he? Thing today? Simon may know if he's there or not. He wrote a great summary that went out on the list since London. About kind of what the options are that are in play for this Now back in R eighty two twenty six, we already created provision we could use the Ai extension within stir certificates ads to get the list of telephone numbers that a particular Sip certificate is responsible for her that it has a... It's scope of authority. By reference. Basically at Url. You go look at that. And you just make sure whoever manages that Url the resource behind it, dynamically updates."

You so you have to trust this person and maybe it's your c or it's your nash long numbering authority or whomever watches over that and make sure that's always accurate. The problem with that, of course, is if you have a very large number list or complicated ones you're revealing a lot of information. About all the numbers that this particular enterprise has, every time somebody hits that. You can't really cache it because again, it could change it like any moment. And your constantly data only is like massive list. It's enterprise as, like, like, Jonathan, like your use case, Like, how many telephone numbers you know? That is a call center provider as pass provider actually like manage at any given time. So we're like, okay. Can we do better? So we looked at a couple of options. The first was Oc without s that is documented in our working group item around this. And the basic idea of this is let's use Oc. Oc is commonly used for cert every single certificate that my company has ever issued has oc in it. What we did though, we added, like this little extension to it. And this extension allows you to just ask about a single telephone number. Thought this had a very valuable kind of not privacy, but corporate data mini immunization. We'll say, property to it. That, you know, you use this extension just to say, hey, the call calling party number I got for this call. As a verification service, is that in scope? Of this certificate at this very moment. Yes or no, that's the only information you get back. And we thought that... And decker, if you have better thoughts I talked to him here was the best way to, like, do data immunization for this. But a lot of people pointed it out, you know, well, that reveals ultimately to whoever is running that Oc service, probably your Ci, who it is that is receiving these calls and for what number? And that data leakage is something that people wanted to avoid. So why can't we just do State? So we started looking at state playing and I have slide about state in a minute, but I'm just articulating what the options are here now."

And the idea behind short lived certificate is even on a per call basis, and authentication service talking to a C could just make a sure right? That is for a single tn n. Use it to sign just for the calling party number of this particular call. And then put that in the x five parameter of the the header. Of the passport. And so relying parties, the verification services when they acquire that certificate can say, oh, great. You know, this this is valid at this this second, we have that on the C authority. And done done. Right? We haven't gave minimize to the same degree that the Oc csp Extension is that we described. The issue of course is well these things are not usually cash. And, like, it may be a bit of a hassle for authentication services to, like, get these dynamically generated certificates. So there's there's a bunch of different ways to skin that cat, right where you can... Maybe have a earth that's bigger than just you know, one number or that lasts longer than the next five minutes. Like there's optimizations you can do that may make it a little better. In terms of the ability of those. But this is something I worked on for a bit and there wasn't ton of interest in it previously. So I have, like, an expired about it that you can go read that's listed up there. But Jack's summary included a new thought. Which was... Well, can we do like the same thing as short lived? But basically with with s, so you don't have to go acquire the sir through the x five. What Mean by sc in this case? Well, probably, sending the leaf Right? And then the x five c that shows you like the search chain for the leaf with it. So that hopefully, the relying party is instance doesn't have to like, dip the C, which has the same properties as those csp with s.

So so but, I guess, I guess if you you regular Csp, doesn't... This has why does that have the same revelation problem as the... Yeah.

We need a way to do this review little as possible where you can validate that the signer of this passport actually controls only that number. That's our design goal. Yeah.

And you, you know, I thought a lot about should there be separate versions of the identity header that pushed certificates or push encrypted versions of passports. We decided there were sensitive things and passports forward to want doing craft, like, but I think I wanna keep this at the passport layer if for no other reason than to support out band.

You could effectively send either the leaf sir or the entire cert chain and embedded in the passport. So all the information that you need to validate that passport without having to go back and talk c at all, is in there, ask part be real big, much bigger than any passports are pushing around today And, of course, we'll we see people on list complaining about Mt u's and arguments having here for decades around all that. But that that's of how I interpreted ultimately what Jack was pushing for when he was talking about s for this. Is that short lived cert is synthesized on the spot for this call, we take it we stick it and either the x five or the entire chain with it,"

I think next slide just like discussion probably? Yeah. So I mean, that that's the only new thing on the menu we previously had, like four things on the menu. Now we got five. That's only new thing on the menu here. Any thoughts about that idea of doing this with short lived where we just package the entire cert and or searching chain in the passport itself. Is anybody have any implementation for example at stir, and I don't know many people here do, though that that would barf. On that. It's a set of the bar. So I just been these Yeah. I know. This has been Campbell. I going to address the a lot of Udp still out there. And I've even know, seen Major carriers talk about how they have Ip interconnect they still can't do there or we're be shaken over because they're Udp. Yeah. But we already can't do any of this. Over Udp. But Chicken should have adopted compact form Time I ago, mister Nguyen. Looking at you. That would been simplified on that. But Yes. Then you're just shoving information over back into the zip still. No. No contact compact form just basically dispense with, you know, everything, but a s that's actually... So if the first the first two dots in that are just gone and all you're left with is the zig. I get guess where I was going with the head, is that if we've already pushed us into using Tcp... Oh oh, then what difference is a little more right. Yeah. For this, like... Yeah, you would then have to have a sip header that would carry, you know, the entire lead certificate, the x I like with it, but Chris? Thoughts"

You like what? The the proposal to package everything, whether it's s either sense of s. Okay. Including this certificate or oc csp s. I think eventually it'd be good to maybe pick one, but if we have to keep both, that's fine, but, you know, that's for my mind is that. I I like your proposal. Okay. Well I I haven't made my proposal yeah. It's on the next line. But you know what it is I. Yeah. Or he got he got the preview. Got the advanced screening. That we held a sort exclusive at South by a couple weeks ago. Next slide, please. Sorry. Yeah. So my next steps, if this was not overcome by the events in our discussion So here's my proposal. I'm I'm still I still wanna let these flowers bloom, not a thousand of them, but I think three of and here's the three flowers I would like left bloom. Let's take that Oc baseline spa which is already working verbatim close to done. I have herd rumor, there are other That have begun in corporate this into their stuff, So let's please get an R number published. Unpublished. Yes. I'm aware. Let's get an our c number on that, please. Just so that is something that people can, you know, rely on in the way that they should rely on. But I'd also propose that we adopt in advance mine currently expired short draft, really hoping Jack was here because I've been trying to twist his arm and actually doing work on it since he's so hot on this solution, and then I I really shouldn't have to write like all these myself."

We're looking integration with Ac Star, for this, And I think at this point it's become clear that the way that people are getting short gets from or from the service providers is just a different interface. And like so I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna have the share fee with, like, the Ac star stuff. And then Take my existing s draft. I wrote for Oc and my proposal, let's that a bit. And have like a... Think about it more like we're gonna have a freshness element that we're gonna add to the passport that can work for either this Oc approach or for the short lived let's like, just spam these search themselves to the relying parties. That is my proposal. What do people think? All these dropped one. Well, so I didn't really drop anything. That's that's this Yes. This is just... So the third is just taking the last two things in combining them. And like, the the fifth one, the very first we already specified two twenty six. So that hasn't been dropped either, So basically, I I am here letting flowers bloom, but so From a workflow perspective of the working group. My proposal is let's say advance, Oc, and short lived. I think they both have applicability I don't think we're in position to pick a winner. And, like, I I even I'm not even sure that they're, like, competing. In some areas. Like, I can imagine cases where you could be using short lived and like, would still be involved. Echo. It seems in the finest solution of the."

My intuition is we should just make the tools available. And like, let those people have access to them. I will say it's not Alright. To think about it More. How clear me. Why your Csp for the insurance certificates s, These are always he's always kind of been like You know, in in in the existing like, what Pci are good reasons for this. Well, no reasons are waste That's not good. Do the installed base, it's not clearly why we have to do both here. It kinda nice more vic. But the reason some reason why you have to...

Mean typically to imagine or better approaching or smaller. Right because you jump instead of two six. Right? Yeah. We out about it. But know those x five c chains could be quite large delegation. Is another to bear in mind. So it's not just like, single level, I mean these could be like five, six level delegation. You're saying each one of those? Yeah. Well, and you gotta do the trip certificate path validation and party and, like, you know, I mean, so not... I I... My intuition is there's no free lunch. Yeah Yeah. Right. Yeah. And then we basically end up doing the same work, like we like positive trip. Alright. Jonathan Rose. So again, in the grand tradition of the Of now pitch winner just to bring it all in there.

So the minutes will show that you're striking from the. Thank you Chris one. I'm gonna scratch well. I'm gonna hire run and and say we should pick one. I'm not concerned about long certificate change. Unless you can think of point to me a a specific use case for that. But I really... I I think we should go for the short lived with be, quote stable. I would understand that just to clarify what I agreed with because I thought it was just the quotes staple and the Staple options. I'd be okay with that compromise, but my preference is the quote staple. I mean, it's it's the simplest one. It's straightforward is it is the most... I I I I mean, yeah I'll I will say that.

We're on a per call basis. You are s a certificate for a single telephone number and providing its chain fur that and getting it into a passport in time.
