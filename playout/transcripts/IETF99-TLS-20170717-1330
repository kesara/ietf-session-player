    "text": "I would I\u0027m surprised you initially mentioned some application based solutions and like in the HTTP layer and then you don\u0027t mention it in the potential working group solutions that is for example one potential solution could be using alt SBC with exported authenticators so that you can do it completely in the application and so you could say that hey my the first time yes you don\u0027t get privacy but then the second that you point to like whatever fronting server that you want and then you can authenticate it authenticate that you own the front a server with exported Authenticator is inside the inside the similar to how people coalesce domains right now so yeah I\u0027m pretty sure that I mean the exported authentication may be a way to simplify some of the design yeah and you know I mean just send an email and explain it sounds good Eric rajala um as sort of a co scribe is something we should be working on I also AM concerned that we have too many mechanisms and we probably shouldn\u0027t I\u0027m trying to bash them into one well I wanted to show up on us at the point Brett was making is I think people may be not quite understanding it and maybe in making crap if I\u0027m if I\u0027m misunderstanding it um dad there are some spectrum endpoints which and we\u0027re in a business on Wednesday to I think which examine the s and I you know the SMI and sometimes the server certificate in order to determine whether to man-in-the-middle or connection and so the idea is you am in the middle box in your network and it looks at the s and I and then maybe the cert and if it like is a banking certificate but it doesn\u0027t respect and if it\u0027s a you know if it\u0027s I don\u0027t know if a specific it it does and um so the the the the concern here right is that um anybody who is willing if you are what if you\u0027re in the non in dispatch bucket and you agree and it becomes known or suspected that you that you were fronting for anybody else then you have to end you have to end up in the inspector pocket and to limit everybody and something inspector I think I think I\u0027ve understood that correctly so I\u0027m not saying I think that\u0027s incredibly important serration my understanding is do not inspect bucket is typically like banks and people like that who probably aren\u0027t willing to front anyway but maybe the policies are different configure during that aspect in which cases might be an issue um the the point I think that serve owed made um is that there are a bunch of natural extensions to this sort of domain fronting that are we\u0027re basically a bunch of content into servers um that are all basically up but all of it show the same credentials effectively and all you\u0027re trying to do is hide us and I between like food github and barbecue how calm and those are things which which we a bunch of HTTP mechanisms to enhance and so we can public a them better on the the things that are on the things we don\u0027t have solutions for that probably "
