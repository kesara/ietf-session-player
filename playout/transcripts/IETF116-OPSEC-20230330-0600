Like, first of all, try to essentially describe or discuss the motivation of this which is one thing why we ended up writing this document in the first place. And then in the introduction also provides some context information which is, you know, super useful to actually go and discuss the rest of the the topics in this document. Next slide, So we know that you the main difference or one the main difference when it comes to Ip six, it's obviously the address space. And these differences in the Ip six Ip six sub with respect to Ip before have like on great implications on on security operations. This is normally, like well known in Ip six circles if you wanted if if there's such a thing like groups like ours, but this is this implications are usually non obvious to other groups. And when I'm saying other groups that could be like, you know, cloud operation groups, dev groups, security operation groups and so on. Now what happens with this group is that quite often they assume that well, there are these Ip six services, they look different they are longer. But for the most part, they assume that they must be the same. Just longer addresses. Right? So they tried these groups tried to apply Ip Ip before policies or Ip... Yeah. I four like concepts when doing Ip six security operations, and that's when, you know, things normally fail or there are like, you know, cut or or surprises in there. So this group was actually motivated by conversations with these kind of groups. I was involved quite a few times whether for companies that I was working for or companies that was consulting for. And, you know, for me, the thing was that we went into conversations and there were a lot of things that I assume that we're obvious to everyone, but well, that wasn't really the case. So that's when we came up with this idea of"

    "text": "you know, trying to discuss this topic because we thought that you know, discussing this topic things, the the... Let's say the the challenges and, you know, possible ways to address those challenges you know, might be of used to other you know other groups. Next slide. So one of the things that I made and in the previous slide was you know, differences, you know, when it comes to Ip six compared to Ip before. I mean, obviously, the address length that's obvious. You might wonder, you know, what other the things, you know, I was thinking of. And and there are a few things in there. Obviously, we are talking about the ones that, you know, probably will have implications on on security operation, which is the topic under the discussion. So one of these differences has to do with the, you know, the properties of the associated addresses. And there's a bunch of properties associated with each Ip six. For example, there's the scope whether the is local link local, whatever. There's stability property which for example, you might have stable addresses and temporary addresses just the name like the two extreme cases if you wait, if you wish. And there's the intended usage property, which is this is normally Non listen, but at the end of the day, for example in cases where you have stable and temporary addresses, well there is intended usage for each of them, like stable for incoming communications addresses for outgoing communications. So that's when comes to irish properties. But there are other things. Like, we all know that, you know, Ip six notes, particularly you know, Ip six costs. They configure multiple addresses at the same time, something that is, like, no it it's unexpected for people coming from, you know, the with just Ip before knowledge, and not just that. Like the is that, you know, our configured actually have a different combinations of the properties that I just mentioned. So you might have the same cost my have, like, you know, one global stable address, one global and temporary"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:10:00",
    "text": "is one link local stable, etcetera etcetera. So many addresses with multiple different combinations of these properties. Another thing that is interesting is that we all know that there are multiple ways to, you know, configure six services. And for example, when it comes to the automatic mechanisms, the Atp on Slack, Normally, the mechanism that you use to configure the addresses ends having you know an effect on the actual properties of the Let me give... An, you know, a super, you know, straightforward example. If you have a a workstation with the and you touch that workstation to an Ip six network that does Slack ubuntu will configure stable and temporary addresses. But in for the most for the most part in most cases, if you touch the same station to an network that does the Version six. Since your temporary is for the the Version are not widely supported. Then for the most part, you will get just this. So the mechanism that you use to configure the ends up having, you know, implication on or ends up, you know, defining some way the properties of the system eventually you get And another thing that is like super important for this topic is that in most of the cases, like you Like, in p six users or, you know, for instance, they have control of a large Ip six service block. Compared these ip before where if you are like super lucky, you might get, like one public Ip before address at home. You're lucky. Right? Sometimes not even. But with I with six as usually the case that at the very least, you get at least a slash sixty four. So the user or the attic concepts like a large block. Next slide. Now key and super related to what I just discussed. And this is normally the case for people doing operations is what's behind on Ip prefix. So what's what's what's the semantics? If you wish of an Ip six prefix."
  },

    "startTime": "00:12:00",
    "text": "And here I'm using the term, you know, prefix in a super general way. So it could be like a slash one hundred twenty eight, meeting single ip six. Order slash whatever. Slash sixty four, like all proper prefix if you wish. So few things to consider here because obviously this will affect the rest of the discussion. First of all, it's super common that multiple map to a single host. And this is because as we were discussing before, normally configure multiple addresses. Okay? These services are normally selected from, you know, from the same slash sixty four, you know, assuming that the the host is connected to a single network, But for example, if it's an advanced user or if it was another, you may assume that actually they may be selected from a larger address block. Like, for example, the the user or the attic do get whole slash forty eight from the Isp or even if it so it doesn't get the slash forty eight. The user might apply, for example, pro to a, you know, a a three account that tunnel broker dot net and get a slash forty forty eight. So that the user or the attic could you'll potentially select from a slash forty eight. Obviously, this is different from the Ip before case, whereas If you're lucky, normally, you just control a single address. Unless you have, like, you know, you know, you control multiple vms or whatever that is. But from a single place you just control single if anything. Now also, there's like, you know, there's a different aspect that while in theory, you'd normally associate once like one Ip six out with a single network interface. That's the theory at least. Now in practice, not Pt or not for Ip six is not uncommon. Whether we like it or not, that's a different question, but it's not uncommon. Okay? And there are technologies like, if you have been, you know, playing with kubernetes for example, when you do, you know, a six kubernetes, normally, what happens is that you do you use like, you know, Ip before private a Pb private space. So to speak, a combination of that and not"

So all of these aspects are going to be key, like stuff in this slide and the previous slide are going to be going to be key when we discuss like, you know, different, you know, aspects of security operations. If you wish. Next slide. So these are three topics that we are going to briefly discuss Obviously, this is a non exhaustive bliss. At all. But this is just three topics just to to see how in stuff that is super simple and super straightforward in Ip before and people will do things in a certain way in Ip before. In Ip six, things are different or you might run to surprise or maybe know you, obviously, but, you know, normally people that come with an Ip before only background, they run into surprises. So we will, you know, cover two areas. One of them is enforcing, like on one hand and blog list on the other hand, and then we will also cover a little bit the area of network correlation essentially trying to analyze the relationship between different network activities. Okay? So next slide, Next slide too. So first thing that we'll do is essentially, we will try to cover or or, you know, at least discuss a little bit the challenges in each of these areas. And then after that, what we'll we'll try to do is to shed some light or not even shed some light, like, you know, try to brainstorm a little bit what are some of the things that, you know, you might possibly to do in these cases. So The first of the topics that we discussed before was the use of. Access control list and in particular, you know, little lists. Normally, obviously, what on here is that you want a specific system to be allowed access to some resource. And in in a way you want to have, like, just an that allows that system and not any other system."

By definition. That's what temporary addresses are. So the others has changed all the time. But also if you have multiple sis on the same, which is normally the case. Not only the other will change by... But the thing of the systems will be inter in the you know in the in that slash sixty four. Like all of them are changing the and all of them peak from the same sixty four. Now the question is, like if you want to let's say implement and fourth this kind of. What what would you allow? What what what what's the that you would configure? Now people with an Ip before background have tenants see to say, well, you know, in Ip before, normally, I you a low like slash ...thirty two like a single ip Ip before address. So if in Ip six, the slash one hundred twenty eight, bids. Then let's allow one like a slash one hundred twenty eight. And obviously, you know, if you have temporary in place, these cycles will change. Like, whatever you find at some moment in time is going to be different later so your your list will fail if you do things that way. Next slide? Then the other topic is blood list And normally, I'm always are... We're not discussing whether, you know, this is good to have or not. We are just saying that these things are done in practice. And these are the challenges that, you know, you you were probably find when you try to, you know, these on Ip six. So What about blood list? Like, depending on the, you know, the environment and the scenarios what you might have is some sort of tool that can feed you will addresses that are known to be engaged some sort of activity.

It might give you the option to actually enforce an based on that offend address. There are also other the tools which do like or allow you to, you know, same kind of stuff like phase one, for example, local tool that you run on, you know, on a on a system, it just scans you know, the logs. And for example, you can configure free balance such that I don't know.

But yeah sources of e that, you know, different sources of my provide information about, you know, engaging in, you, in malicious activity, For example, Now the question here that these tools will normally give you a slash one hundred twenty eight like a single address. Similar to what happens in, you know, in the Ip before well. Now the question is, well, what should we block? Okay. We learn on, you know, full Ip six slash one hundred twenty eight, what should we block. Now this is tricky. So if you come from, you know, from a... Or if you approach this topic from an Ip before perspective. Obviously, what you do is you just block the slash one hundred twenty eight. But that's freaky for two reasons. One of them is that you since the odd controls like large block the attic could intentionally like trigger you know, the generation or the enforcement of a lot of, you know, wasteful just because the other can use the whole outer space.

But even if they got to block something, then you just switched to a different address and you continue your. Obviously doing this and Ip before, you know, based on the I for risk, scarcity is way way more difficult. At least you couldn't do this like even from home. Okay? You have to, you, you have to have, like, some systems or vms or whatever. But you wouldn't be able to do this as easily as you can in pb six. Next slide, And network activity correlation, well for the same reasons is like you non trivial exercise, because, you know, based on what we discussed before, Essentially, you could have like either multiple system behind a single behind slash one hundred twenty eight, or actually, you could have, like, say no that it's moving around all around in slide forty eight. So the topic is is tricky or at least on trivial. So these are the challenges when doing these three things. Hello list, blog list and network activity correlation. Next slide, So now it's like more than advice, I you say this is like brainstorming not even not my in of cases this if these are things that I either did myself, or that while discussing with document either on the mailing list or another list.

So if you have, like, multiple systems on, you know, on the same subnet, you'd would have to find a way to bigger stable there are multiple options for that could be manual configuration it could be some form of the Version six. Or could also be slack if you are using, for example, stable, seventy two seventeen and you disable temporary addresses. Now if you get to do that, if you get to do stable one way or another then, you know, the that's the way the other is stay and you can enforce the by specifying, you know, slash one hundred twenty eight. The other option is that if for some reason, you can have systems you know, do addresses, or you want these systems to do temporary for whatever reasons, then you don't have much more of an option if you want to enforce cycles that to segregate them into different subnet and then specify the slash sixty four because that's the prefix that the system will use. And they will be changing you know the each system will be changing its services within that slash sixty four. I mean, not necessarily nice, but it is what it is. Right? Next slide, this So we cover alone list, so what about blood? So we were saying before that normally you have some source of information for that you might want to work and you know, the potential problem here is that you might end up, you know, getting a lot of other is that you might want to include or you might be tempted to include in in an in a block list. So what you probably want to do is to keep an eye on that and be able to aggregate addresses. And obviously as you aggregate, into, let's say Dot use shorter prefixes.

This is definitely it this is more brainstorming more than a recommendation when you look at the values, these are just values to have a number to refer to. Not we are not pretending or expecting that these numbers are good or you know, even, you know, good enough. So the basic idea is that you might say okay, well, I going to have like, different levels of aggregation. Let's call it level one, two, three and four. Whereas level in level one, you specify the slash one hundred twenty eight level two slash sixty four. Level three slash for fifty six and level four slash forty eight. And the basic idea is that, you know, whenever any of these tools give you an offend address what you do is you configure a slash one hundred twenty eight. And if event, and you you keep these for, let's say an hour, this is common for many of the tools that we have discussed. Now if eventually at some point, you are able to aggregate say for this case, then different system different slash twenty eight into the same slash sixty four, then what you do is always you aggregate those services you remove the individual slash one hundred twenty eight twenty eight into a single, you know, slash sixty sixty four. Then you might run it do the same thing. For example, if it's the same attic moving over the space, So you might have multiple slash sixty four. The result of aggregating slash hundred twenty eight. And if eventually, there's example, ten of the slash sixty four that you can aggregating the slash fifty six, then you do that. This is a way of, you know, reducing the number of you know, entries that you might have in your blog list. Obviously, did doesn't come for free.

So for the Ip six case at the very least what we thing that these tools would provide is like no right away, the ability that you can select in the tool, you know, what's the the that identifies the perfect that potential identifies the actor So that...

You... Like, there's this As far as I'm aware and I'm like I'm not definitely not an Ip expert or like, a networking expert expiration say?

Thank you. Yes. I pretty today... So fact thank you very much for Fernando for this this work. So I have two streams of comments. So the first one is to come back to support this work and to support with Giga said actually to perhaps complete your answer to chris because Chris, I would really like we have a discussion in no ideal world I I instantly sincerely would like. I cannot understand your head is busy, my is busy too. So let's test try to see what we have in mind. The the I think what I would like to highlight here is the context of operational security. Context of a partial of security just remind people I think five years ago were missing seeing two point one million security specialists. Today, the number is three point four medium cyber equity cybersecurity specialist. So the issue is that when you are faced seeing what is the number one problem to today is on somewhere. You suddenly have a total panic because the teams are not prepared not aware I've not been doing the right things, and you are going to to be exactly about to lose an entire business and by losing an entire business. I have examples of companies that the the manner to survive by one link, one link Otherwise they would lose thirty years of business, something like through vegans. I couldn't give you these many example. So The issue is not about Where we go is now we have an urgency."

But I think it is very useful to have those noting the to file, to give a chance to people who are not way. I'm not trying. I mean, Beyond that, the the fundamental issue is not just finished missing three point four million people. Is today the state of operational security is extremely bad. We have people who come casually to the job. There is no the massive lack of training and so on So is just to why the gap between what we all would like to have which is not even have of these middle boxes. It should all be secured by design. That would be fantastic. But it's not the case. So in for these reasons, I would like to support this work. The second thing has nothing to do with it. It has to do is I served an It ut there is a technical report That is not about this exact topic, but I think it's it it has some connection. It's not about ip six it's like s sr six on a similar intention to document some operational issues. So maybe I think there was a reason statement that was sent from Seventeen to and if we would established this here, I think to be good to reply that actually, there is work here. Maybe there are synergies to be done this way, So just to. Okay. Thank you. We'll do the quick paul on the adoption, which will be confirmed from the list. So let me"

Looked at some of the issues and requirements for the encryption of S and I. Within Tls one point three and later. There's a sort brief mention within it where the document characterize una so an anticipated usage of I information It gives a brief assessment of some of the alternative options in the event that the Sma data is encrypted. And suggests that most of those una anticipated usage function can probably be realized by other means. So the intent of the document that I'm talking about today is effectively to build on those comments in in that Ro and and that free document in a bit more depth. Some of those usages and by implication then document the likely operational impacts of the encryption of the S and I data within encrypted client. Hello. Which for those if you're not following closely the sort Tls working group That's pretty well advanced. So I believe may well complete it journey possibly this calendar year.

So say that Eth when it encrypt the sla and indeed other data does have some operational implications for some use cases. Just echoing a discussion that we had in another place, it it be report to say that it does have positive implications for many use cases it being correct to say that they're all negative. But there are some less positive implications which certainly if they're not understood, could could have adverse operational impacts and that's it's that latter group but we're focusing on within the draft. And within the document itself, thus far. We've we've really focused on the implications in private edge and public networks And in particular looking at educational establishments, enterprises and public network operators is three primary categories. We don't necessarily have to just concentrate exclusively on those, but those are the three which we have identified whether significant impacts We're open to anyone that wishes just to suggest any expansion.

On the large enterprises where this is a topic where we've drawing it to their attention is pretty high on on their radar now. What we're not trying to do, The document is to I identified so technical solutions specifically and certainly, and I think it's important to state this explicitly We're not questioning the wisdom of the development of Ec as an approach. Working assumption is that that is and will happen So it's just important to document the operational considerations on the security side for it. About wanted to emphasize that because I think each time we've had this discussion People have questioned whether the objective is to stop Pc So it isn't but it's important to make sure this impacts are understood. Next slide, please. Now In looking at some of the documentation that's been written to date around Ec. That's one of the things which seem to be missing to us was I'm understanding that the S and I but encapsulated by is important. That these of a legitimate interest to on path security actors.

Next slide, please. I I won't read through the detail. This is just if you've got a chance to look at the draft yet this gives you a sense of the structure of the document as it currently stands. Where we look at just some of the general considerations then drill down into a little bit more depth into the educational sector enterprises, public network operators, and then just tease out some of the the general issues around things like threat detection. So network what management and so on. The document is by no means finished and currently, there's a section there looking at potential future development. Of the work and we've said got markers within the existing text where additional inputs is needed. And if you look on the github, you're assuming got list of actions captured where further activity is also required And I should say that obviously, in addition to those things, there's an abstract and the other So mandatory requirements of an Rf.

    "text": "that that that we've seen looking at schools as an example so use case. You you may not know that in the Uk and the U. S. Markets sales schools have to operate content filtering. For example, Uk it's it's it's a mandatory requirement schools to operate it and it has to be effective. In the Us, I think it not technically sure it's a mandatory requirement but if you're not operating content filtering, you can't access certain federal funding. So it's certainly an expectation clearly. Much of the school content filtering software uses I. To work. It's a functional requirement for that. So I would also just comment that when you look at the operational capability of schools when it comes to things like It, it's pretty limited. So moving to sort enterprise type management capabilities is not a practical alternative in in the school environment. You've got a to typically one person in say Uk secondary school of a small to medium secretary school, whose main task is doing things like getting the address white balls working. As well as just checking every often that the content filtering works by no means an expert in this sort of area. So it has to be fairly easy. To use software On the enterprise side, again, just briefly so B bring your own device often uses transparent proxies that needs sma to work. Yes. Are certainly toes available for it, but I ironically, they typically will require much more invasive software to be installed directly on the third party devices"

One of the big concerns from Cs is compliance so regulatory compliance obligations that they have will they have to be able to guarantee that they're monitoring all inbound outbound traffic. It say in the finance sector, then we've again, you're seeing the draft, we've noted a recent example in the. Us. Where ten banks are each being fined two hundred million dollars for lack of compliance because they weren't aware of certain interactions from some of the staff using band software. So this is high priority two hundred million dollars There's a lot of money even for a large bank. And when you get to the small medium business is again, they just don't have the enterprise management capabilities of the large ones in using off the shelf, often consumer software. So wouldn't be able to use same tools. So anything that's more sophisticated than becomes more of a challenge for them technically. And next slide, please. And then the public network content At the moment, we mainly focus more on on the use for of content blocking, whether there it's sort of legally mandated principally, but also some voluntary. Where there tends to be a mixture of things used, but S I is certainly a part of the mix that is used and again, but my enterprises are often legal consequences. It's said in some markets for operators that don't have effective filtering. Implemented. I think is certainly one of the areas where there's more more work to be done on on the content.

And understood. This definitely an opportunity to contribute to the draft it currently stand stands and also just to sc it, provide a comment on it. So really the question that we wanted to pose was whether there's agreement within the working group and obviously, by the chairs that this will be an appropriate topic for working group to adopt, and then we can continue with the development the draft. And I'll pause there for any questions. The available time. Yeah. We have six minutes so. Please? I see people go to the mic. Hi. Daniel Con gilmore. H. So I am not a fan of mandated filtering regimes generally, as probably are not surprised, given that I for the Ac. But I'm unaware of any filtering regimes that mandate the use of And I filtering. And even the cases where they're mandatory filtering regimes. And I is not a reliable signal. I can connect today to w w dot I e f dot org. And send it an S and I of ssl dot cloud or s n I dot at cloud s ssl dot com, and it works fine. As far as I can tell, any S and based filter regime would fail, if they were trying to keep me from access to Of dot org. No. Well, you're right. You can do that. However, two things. Firstly, yeah. Most legislation aware of doesn't mandate specific techniques. Some of the the location certainly specify specifies it has to be effective As we hope it wouldn't. Got this is the important tool. If you look at much of the software, so I bananas better qualified nights to so the enterprise of where where it uses us now, I yes, it's known"

    "text": "that you can fool it. So the reverse techniques they use first to make sure that it's reliable before it's used as a signal. So so as I understand though, it is not reliable. And so if this is about operational considerations for people trying to comply with filtering mandates, it seems like this draft should talk about how the signals that they are currently relying on are unreliable. Not that not what happens when the signal goes away. If the goal is operational considerations for people trying to comply with filtering, If this draft does not acknowledge that their current mechanisms are unreliable, then it's not doing them the service that I think you are aiming to do. So the draft already acknowledges that it can be unreliable and talks about steps to validate. I mean, it's a bit like the conversation you had about Ip six. Is part of a defensive in depth option. But get Ar I might want to eject because he's got more knowledge in this area, but So... I mean, I made the same comment on the chat about the Ip six defense and dev. Fernando proposed approach to filtering his Iot device to make sure that they don't do the wrong thing on its network. By filtering them by Ip address, will fail if his Iot devices simply select different Ip addresses. And so his filtering technique is not sufficient to keep the Iot devices from doing what he thinks he doesn't want them to do. It is not effective in the same way that S and I filtering is not effective. So again, to be clear And then all coming in a second, when we took about use of S and I it's in the context of understanding that that there own weaknesses it's not perfect. It's part of an important mix. I mean, you'll be familiar with the indicators of compromise so document wishes mentioned at the start Es is an important indicator of compromise. It's not the only one. But it's better to at least look at it than than ignore it. So it's it's it's it... That's the the view in the world. Any case, but on, please."

Why some people started to create something calls the costs. Right? So when we are in security, you cannot rely on anything. So And I is just one of these elements like plenty of others that can be fooled can be triggered that can be change. I mean, just think about email, for example, and others. So from a security partial security footprint. There is nothing new here. The fact that we should not rely on the S and I today, they are all of the businesses in the world are using network security proxies to contact protect themselves using the big because that that's the only practical thing you can use today actually do what you must do. So what the techniques that the proxies are doing and I hope we can even document him on that in the development of these is to explain how we start with the fact that we have to check you And I is the correct is correct. At that moment. Most of the time, interesting, most of the time So we using the I because this is this is how this has been built and as the last element, we can use on network security to do on the enterprise side, which is called selective decrypt safety decrypt. Is required to do what we call the prevention and that is what is required. So if this is removed, how you going to do that? I have no idea But today the... To come back on this work, so we have made in the github that we hope unfortunately I could not for stupid reason public completely, but we intend to open quickly as we can this meeting.

But I was hoping you could elaborate on these environments wherein in it's insufficient to implement the same effect at the Dns and you also need to do it based on the Sn I. Like, what are what are those environment? And like, because that... That's kind like the true measure of breakage of Ach h. If you if you were to Turn Ach, and it's used environments where you you don't have like, a filtering capability in the Dns layer. And you are only using And I. Then, yeah. Like those people are gonna have a bad day because, like, Ach takes that away. So I'm wondering, like, Like, that that seems like perhaps the important deployment environment to focus on. And if there's like, any real, like, data or whatever this suggests how pervasive this particular deployment environment is, that would be quite useful. Because if at end of the day, it's just there... If there's just two worlds where... But I kinda see like, three worlds. There's, like, a world in which you can implement to the Dns layer, in which case like, just do that. If that's what you're doing to today e asia. No effect on that. Like I have opinions I'm right. It's a good thing, but like, you could just do it in Dns. The other world is, like if you need to look at Urls, to actually filter content. Sn and I is gonna do nothing for you. Like, you need to look at the url.

Can't met in the middle to do it at the layer, and you like are forced to do it at And I. And I I just I I I don't have a good understanding of, like, how big that world is compared to the other two.
