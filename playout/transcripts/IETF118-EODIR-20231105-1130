Also for those of you who are between me and line of sight, obviously, this is room is a little bit awkward. So if you want to move where you can see a little bit better, if you want to see us, you might wanna do that. So this is basically what we're gonna be talking about today. And there's 3 of us up here. We're gonna of us is gonna do different parts of the program. I'm Karen O'Donoughue. I've been coming to the IETF now for close to 30 years. And I'm one of the coordinators of education and outreach director it. So we're obviously very interested in your experience here. And, With that, I'm gonna have my 2 co speakers introduce themselves. Is this is this on? You can hear me? Okay.

But right now, I focus on new participant activities and, helping with the the guides program, which some of you may have seen also on the mailing list. And various other things, but I work for the secretary at AMS which helps plan the meetings and organize everything. Hi. Hi. My name is Rick Solz, I'm, comparison newcomer. Only been 12 years, 15. And I do a lot of work in the security area. I was also chair of Namcom last year and then McGadfly about the way the IETF organizes something. So and And and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and been involved with the newcomers and the I outreach and, education for 5, 6 years. Alright. With that, as you can see, we have a fair amount of diversity in our experience up here, so feel free to reach out to any of us at any time. With that, we'll go ahead and get started. So this particular presentation we wanna sort of set the expectations for it. It talks about the IATF in general, and it gives you the information that will help you get started this week. It's not a history of the IETF. It's not everything you ever wanted to know about the IETF, that would obviously take a little bit more than this. So, if there's something you feel at the end of this that is missing, feel free to, speak up. And if there's especially as you go through the week, you're like, wow. It would be really helpful if had told me this at that point. Any of those kinds of things that you realize as new participants, were a little bit of a struggle for you. Those are the kinds of things we'd like to know about. First of all, you're gonna see this when you register for the meeting, you you, clicked and acknowledge this, and you'll see it all way is a set of rules that we abide by, and by coming to this meeting by registering this meeting, you have agreed to"

And there's a whole set of processes also, things like code of conduct from the anti harassment, intellectual property, those kinds of things are covered in all of these different BCPs. So if you have any questions, be sure to talk to any of the leadership and they will be happy to give you some advice on those. The other thing is we do track attendance at the meeting. This is an standards organization. And so we need to have, you know, some awareness of who's in the room and who's influencing the development of the standards. Were gonna be asked in every meeting that you attend, to scan acute QR code. You might have heard of us talking about blue sheets in the past. We've passed around blue sheets. We do are starting to do that again for those of you who have trouble scanning those QR codes, you can you can scan this rounds you can join the meeting, using a full laptop client or you can use the the client that's on your on your phone. Also, another thing is asking questions in sessions. Obviously, this is a working meeting, so we want people be able to ask questions. But we do manage because we are a, a Meeting that is both in person and remote, and we like to have be sure that all of the remote participants have the opportunity. We do manage the queue. And so we have a queue and you have to join the queue and know that to ask a question. And you can do that either with the full client, or you can use it on your laptop queue. Feel free to ask any questions as we go through this meeting. And then next thing, just to sort of, as an admin part, lanyards, pins, and buttons.

Yellow is, I'm a little bit cautious. So, you know, elbow bumps or whatever. And then you know, red is, you know, please maintain, some distance. The last one is language buttons. There is buttons downstairs. And if you speak other languages, please please feel free to grab 1, and that way you all can connect with other people that speak and, sometimes that helps, especially for the new participants. So that's all of the admin details. The next section is the overview of the IETF. So the, Mission of the IETF is to make the internet better by producing high quality relevant technical documents that influence the way people design use and manage Internet. The whole point of this is we're developing standards that actually get used. And our general ethos is that everybody can participate. It's not limited to companies or governments, and it, you know, you might never you could could could could could could could could could could easily be an active participant in the IETF and never physically attend a meeting.

But you know, you can look over time for the standards that have been deployed and have a lot of, uptake, and that is that's what we're striving for. These are this is our objective. So it is a standards development organization, if you're familiar ITU, IEEE, there's an there's a number of different types of standard organizations out there. We have self selected individual participants. Now, obviously, participants do com representing the company or whoever is funding them to come. Or at their university, if they're doing working on academic grants, or they may be doing it on their own personal remit. So the it's It is it tends to be driven by market based adoption. A lot of what you said, if you were here this weekend and you saw the hackathon, you know, what you what you're seeing is, a a cyclical development process where it's It's not that you completely write the standard, and then you start development. It's that you you do, prototypes, and then you evolve the standard based on that prototype. I know that, the working group that I chair. There's a couple of of folks downstairs who are working and then they plan to come out of this weekend with here are some Here's some additional information we need in the specification because it was not for me to be able to do the implementation. It is bottom up. There's no formal voting. We do raise hands and we occasionally and there's no formal government role. This is not to say that governments don't participate. It's just There's no formal role for governments here. And then there's no boost your sales or those kinds of things because it's a working model. Working meeting. The funding model for the IETF.

Of the things that you probably saw downstairs is, This meeting, we have no sponsor. So, because we'd have no sponsor of the meeting, we don't have a social. Sometimes we have social on in, one evening during the week. We don't have that. We also don't have t shirts for free. A lot of times we give out t shirts for each meeting. But those are the kinds of things that sponsorships get us, and since we don't have a sponsorship this time, don't have those kinds of things. We do have a lot of other sponsorships, and you'll see the signage around, like, the the inclusion and the connectivity sponsorship. If you look at the hackathon, there's a number of sponsors that sponsored all of that activity. So the big picture The IETF, is made up of number of bodies. The first one is the IESG, so that's the internet engineering steering group. And every working group in the IETF is belongs to an area. And each area has 2 or maybe 3 area directors. And that collection of area directors makes up the IESG. On the research side of the house, we also have the internet research task force. We and that is for work that's not ready for standardization yet or think or for topics that are a little bit outside the scope standardization. For example, there's a human rights protocol considerations working group. Those kinds of things happen in the IRTF. The IRTF has a collection of research groups, and then they have a steering group that manages that collection of research groups. It's made up of the chairs of the research groups and some invited participants. There's also the internet architecture board That provides oversight to the internet architecture. It also manages"

If you go on to their website, you'll see a whole section on all of the of the The final group to mention is the Administrative LLC. And that is the group that does all of the funding and administration. Manages all of the contracts. So, it's basically the The corporate home for the IETF and the IV and the IRTF, and it does, you know, fiscal things and administrative support. There's also 2 other bodies that I have on here that are related to the IATF. And support the IHTF but stands separate a little bit. A little bit. First one is the RFC editor. And that publishes all of the documents that we have. Obviously very closely related to the IETF, also publishes, additional streams And there's a whole separate tutorial that could be done on on how the IR how the RFC editor is structured. And finally, there's Ayanna, which is internet. It does names and numbers. So, developing a protocol and you need a protocol ID, it goes through IAnada, and they manage all of our lists of of all of those kinds things. Those two functions are very, critical to the maintaining of our standards going forward. So I mentioned that there that working groups are in collections of areas.

The internet area. Which does the the IP protocols, ipv4, ipv6, IPV 6 ops, those kinds of things on ipV 6 ops is actually in operations and management. But, also, time synchronization, if you're interested in that, that's in the internet area. Operations and management does the network management protocols. It also does operations kinds of things. And so that's where, you know, once a protocol is really stable. And a lot of the work that's going on is talking about, deployment types of issues. And you I know there's a V Six ops. There's also DNS ops. There's CIDR ops, which is the secure inter domain routing protocol. There's the security area, which has which does all of the security mechanisms. And finally, there's the gen general area, which generally focuses on things about updating IETF processes and those kinds of So those are the current areas. You'll see on the agenda how they're marked. Collected into those areas. The next thing that comes up a lot in the IITF is the IITF is based on a consensus model. And so this is not a strict majority voting. This is about, when you get rough consensus, all of the issues that have been addressed but not necessarily accommodated. So that doesn't mean that that that that that that that that that you know, everybody gets their way. What it means is the group has discussed the issue and decided a way forward. Based on rough consensus. So you you can be heard, but the dissenting opinions don't necessarily control. There's no, like, veto power. So humming is a way to measure consensus, that is not voting.

But what it's really about is measuring consensus, you know, how strongly do people feel you know, if if everybody in the room kind of agrees with something, they might all home softly. If everybody feels know, passionate about it, they might, louder. It also doesn't allow you to tell who across the room is is, you know, favoring one thing or another. It's supposed to give you some sort of Anonymity is the wrong word, but some sort of how, you know, how do people generally feel? How passionate do they feel? How do you get it that way? The session chairs, the working group chairs, it's one of their biggest jobs is to, determine the consensus in the working group. And, in some working groups, obviously, it's a lot easier than others. There's, a whole RSC on consensus and humming written written by Pete Resnick. So If you are interested in this further, I'd encourage you to read the RFC. So the next thing people wonder is, you know, how do you join working groups and contribute to existing work. So, you know, you start out by looking the later on, we're gonna talk about resources. And the most important resource for you all to really get familiar with. Is the data tracker. Everything that's done in the IHTF is in the data tracker somehow. Now, So every working group has its own data tracker page. And as you can see across the top, it has a thing about about the working group itself, and then it has a list of the documents It has all of the previous meetings and minutes associated and materials associated with those meetings. It has a link link to the list archive, so it has a mail every working has a mailing list. Every man and, their archive is available publicly. So you can see the charter and the milestones. The working group I will admit sometimes working group chairs or covered that Some are better than others at updating milestones. So some of the milestones might look a little bit out of date"

So So that's how you join existing work. How do you start new work in the IETF? As we've already talked about, the IETF is is contribution driven. So it doesn't help you to come here and say, you all should do that. You need to come here and say, here's a problem that needs to be solved. And here's a possible solution for that problem. And so Participants identify a problem that needs solving, and later on in the presentation, somebody gonna reference, for example, the hot RCs tonight, and those are like, lightning talks on, possible new ideas And that's a good way to just say, hey, I have an idea Is there anybody else interested in this particular topic? And because the next step step, once you find you know, the last step is actually the willing you need to find people willing to work on the problem with you. So The problem needs to fit into one of the areas, and it needs our align with the architectural principles of the, of the internet. And if it does that, than you bring the IET, you bring the work to the IETF. There's a number of ways that, it gets into the working group process. And And then once it gets into the working group process, it just continues as thing. Once the other couple things on scope, first of all, the research needs to be basically complete. So you're you're not gonna spin up a working group to do research. It's it's but there's already a problem that's identified and possible solutions on the table. And that is how a working group gets started. I Yeah. Here's and here's some additional information on that."

There's really good tutorial on how to bring new the IETF but but you know, the previous slide was about the basic process, but how do you really make it happen? The the one of the key things you need to do is to find some collaborators that have a similar interest. Need to write submit initial internet drafts, maybe have some Barb offs. Now Barb off is another one of those terms that com, might not be. And a a Barboff is just basically an informal gathering of people. Historically, you know, the idea was you would all go down to the bar and sit around the bar and write on napkins. You know, that's that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, still happen some. It also may happen in some of the side meetings and later in the meeting. In the in the this presentation, we'll talk about the side meeting Wiki, and and if the informal meetings. You know, that's also often new work spinning up or discussions about new work spinning up. So once you have some initial text, and you have some initial collaborators, you might want to talk to the area directors in the relevant area. Some of the areas have these these sessions called dispatch sessions. A dispatch session is basically you coming. To the work, to the dispatch group, with your idea. And then they'll say, you know, they'll have a a quick discussion on it, and then it's like, should we try to start a working group on this, or should we do, you know, like an AD sponsored document, or is this something that the the general dispatch group feels is not within the scope of the IETF. But if you're interested in particular area and look the new work that might be coming in that area. Watch for those dispatch sessions on the agenda because that's where they come in. So once you've got to this point, you might want to propose a boss, and there's a whole process for for proposing a boff. And boff is basically birds of a feather.

So if you're interested in a boss proposal, and you wanna get some additional information to get you know, some guidance on how to properly structure it so it might be accepted. You could also reach out to the IAB or to the work of the area directors. Then you hold your boss. And you hope that it is dramatic. You know, it's super successful. And then the consensus of the BAF determines what the next steps are. So the the leadership, the IES and the IV, and we'll get together, and they'll discuss, you know, there there's a whole process for spinning up working groups. And there's also, as part of that, there's a community comment, anyway, if you're interested at all in new work, I strongly suggest that you take a look at this tutorial.

We had 2 people the committee who were here at IETF number 1. And they've been more or less there every single one. And it can be kind of intimidating.

A lot of people do sign though and and don't show up. So if you weren't able to sign up early, you can always kinda hang out in the room, and we can see if the room's not too crowded and you can usually come on in. So then we also offer a, new participants dinner at not an actual IETF activity. It's something that the secretary, it helps put on, $15. I think as about an hour ago, we had 5 or 6 spots left. There's just a chance for new participants to connect with other new participants. It's really just for you to make connections and maybe find some with some, common interests and, you know, again, instant people that you're you're meeting.

For working group chairs, the area directors make the selection of the working group chair. Sometimes a lot of times it's you know, there's a set of interested parties that got the work started.
