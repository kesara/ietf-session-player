This is the first client authentication recommendations for encrypted DNS co-authored between the folks here, myself, Jess, Jeff, and Matt. Next slide, please. So basically, talk about usually clients authenticating to an encrypted DNS server is a bad thing in the consumer case because it's exactly the anonymization, it's user tracking, right? We don't want to do it usually clients authenticating to an encrypted DNS server is a bad thing in the consumer case because it's exactly the anonymization, it's user tracking, right? We don't want to do. But in managed cases, and I use the word enterprise because it helps us map to real human thinking, but practically whenever the administrator of both ends is the same entity and wants to do this or gate access to the name resolutions and control who gets to see those name resolutions, then I'll authentication suddenly does make sense And so this draft is attempting to lay out when it makes sense since the a client being overly willing to provide authentication to a server is a bad thing, but still needing to sometimes means guidance is good and then talking through what the solution, what the recommended practice should be. Next slide, please. And just as a spoiler, alert, this is the approach we took, where we talked about well in this scenario these are the kind of requirements we'd want to"

Next slide, please And this came up in the context of working in the B6 ops working group with Jen on a draft for C CLAT recommendations, basically telling a node when should you turn on C-Lat? and how, which for those in the room, who love DNS and don't know about the IPV-6 stuff, is really about, we need to discover a prefix from the network and then use it to encounter IPv4 traffic inside IPV6. Great that's, we get, one way to get that prefix is from DNS server, but that RFC today said consider you should use a secure channel to make those queries and secure accounts as use an IPC based VPN or something at the link layer. That's the exact definition. Not, not good after all the work this group has done and others right?

But the other thing it's does that I didn't name, accountably for is it removes out it removes a DNS like fallback that said, well if it's not a secure channel, then use DNSEC to validate a resolution from the DNSX4 server that it can sign with a name you expect to be associated to DNS64 server. Well, if we can discover a name associated with the source i.e. by using a DNR, then we have a much better mechanism, right? now. And so it just removes that mechanism entirely So when I posted that to the mailing lists, the discussion immediately turned to, well, why don't we just deprecate DNS64 altogether, which kicked off all lively discussion.

So where we are is, you know, how to do TLS to DNS and how to get certificates down there to make TLS happy. But there's other places where certificates on those same CBE can be helpful, like H2TPS for this TPE management, and then on other CBE, like in NAS or a laptop that wants to serve its disks to other devices in the network, which again could be a CPE that is also your router Some of them have disk drives connected to them And it wants to do SMB over Quick or SMB over TLS And also a printer, which, of course, you know, it's not built into your router, or at least I haven't seen one yet, but in other things that we'd like to connect to directly ideally internet of things a thing that can up at IETF119 was also a Plex server in the house, which might be integrated into a set-top box, might be a dedicated workstation that you have at home where you're connecting directly to it rather than connecting to a cloud to rendezvous between the thermostat and the smartphone but rather having the smartphone connect directly to the Internet of things device and having a real certificate for that is the solution for that today But ADD seemed to"

I think there's requirements that we're missing And, you know, these are the techniques that have been mentioned. I emailed the working group yesterday with a pointer to martin thomson Google Doc, which is at the bottom, the HTTP for what? domains. He explores both what Mozilla deployed for their IOT gateway as well as a bunch of other ideas, some of which are similar to what's in the document that we have, the ADD encrypted DNS forwarders. And it's like, you know, do the normal CA signed certificates, but we get pushed back from that, from CAs. You know, we need to come contract with them, throw them some money, somehow get over their, their rate limit, clearly that's possible, but also do we want to do other techniques? the short-lived certificates and name constraint are things that the authors of the document have talked about for a while but perhaps there are other techniques that would reduce our reliance on CAs So that's all I have for presentation My only follow-up slide is soliciting authors, so we'll just leave this slide up and see what folks have to say You have several people in the queue now, so Tobias.

Okay, I like try to get the microphone. So Tobias Fivich, Max Plan, Institute for Informatics, but speaking for myself So what I would say is that technically the ACME slash CA way with a domain assigned per CPE would be the most well technically sensible, but I do see the CA problem And the question is whether TLSA might be actually something useful theirs, because if clients would start to actually support that for HTTP, then in ISB, could just basically handle TLSA registration from the end devices for the delegated zone under their whatever zone or CPEs and that problem kind of could be solved in a very local way Okay Everything that problem kind of could be solved in a very local way.

Looks like we are now talking about plain, normal TLS search in ADD which is up to the shutter, right? So we can continue working here But that's outside of the chatter. I'm missing the point Well, we need to solve this problem for ADD, so a DNS server sitting at the CPU, what sort of authentication? and identity do we want to do to that server? Sure but let's at least keep focus just on the DNS server, DNS forewaters, right? Sure. Particularly outside of the scope of the ADD working group. So, Eric, to questions there from the chairs.

I mean, I'll comment back that it does seem that the use of the CA, the program of the CA on the CPE to discover the resolver on the CPE if present is a necessary component of the discovery mechanism. So then you could argue that it belongs here. That's the point where I say, yeah, it's maybe in the chat shutter. But honestly, like we said, in 119, the problem is much broader than ADD and let's fix all the problem together I mean, outside of ADD, clearly Now we can continue to talk here, right? so is there such a group we can create one or work in other in Acme, for instance, not really in the Charter, but we can try to find a good home for this because the good home is better than a bad home I got to Eric okay yeah most probably, right, I say Acme, because, yeah. Sure three for the bad news, right? q my soul mp. i nf and Acme enthusiast um i think you have correctly identified the problem here that TLS is tied to a CX and there is work to not tie it to a CA, but in the current state of things, it is tied to a CA and a publicly trusted CA at that Acme is probably the best way that we currently have to do this"

I think we can split off the TLS bit and shove it over to ACMI, and ACMI can deal with how do we automate these certificate issuances for the devices in a home network Thanks benjamin schwartz So first to Tobias mentioning TLSA that is essentially the premise of the Danish working group which attempted to lay out an architecture for that You can follow that work if you're interested in what they came up with. I agree with everyone saying this is the wrong place for this discussion. I do think that Acme may not be the best place either. In my view, we need to go much deeper and think about what the entire user flow looks like In my view, I think probably the entire concept of an HTML scheme or for example, in the context of home networking is just not right. And so we need to go to start you know, from the W3C, figure out what it would mean to have a proper URI that identifies a device on a home network and how that process across the whole stack"

I think Marchant's Thompson's HGPS for Local Domains model, which is similar to what SFS did many years ago, where you have the host name cryptographic tied to the certificate.

And if you assume that we're at a point where you want a certificate for a given name on the box and that the scenario really only works, when the box is able to connect upstream anyway why not use that instead of star potential? even if it's just a list why it's not under consideration Other than that, though, just to the larger discussion, I don't know exactly where it should be.
