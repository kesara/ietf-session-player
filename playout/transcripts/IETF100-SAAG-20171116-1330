    "text": "common channels for inter domain coordination so when you talk about the inter domain mitigation for DDoS actually the Holy Grail really the holy grail of the inter domain mitigation is what we call the source and filtering where destination AES directly talks to the AES that are actually serving those potential attack sources by directly saying that hey please drop XYZ packets and then you know so say yes okay okay I will set up you know some firewall or packet filters and then the packet are you know dropped at the source AES and the meeting that the leaders attacked at the destination is mitigated and this is actually an ideal form of DDoS mitigation because it really stops the the attacks earlier by outsourcing the filtering to the source AES and a couple of examples including you know D word or stop it you know in terms of you know academic projects there has been clear advantages reduction of bandwidth waste because you stop the attack you know at the source not at the destination so you can save lots of bandwidth and you can cut you can reduce the cost and also some resource demanding filtering operations like complex complicated rate limiting can be also and we you know executed at the source is because source a is is not under attack but destination is under attack so they have resource also some local context at the sources can be used can be utilized for example the source is may know some you know user suspect you know list of user suspects under their customer networks so it can be actually used so this source and the filtering looks really fine but this has not been deployed in the current internet due to the lack of trust between aliases so what do I mean by this is simple source AES and destination a yes they actually mutually untrusted the reason is that they have there is no direct business relationship between the so CAS and the destination is is they are you know multiple AES hops away from each other they are basically random guys on tape on the internet and there\u0027s no direct agreement between the two so they mutually distrust each other and this these mutually under untrusted AES may launch attacks to each other for example the source a is on the left hand side may try to modify the requested policy from the destination AES you know the the the request and even worse it can may leak the requested policy from the destination AES also the sources may not have any strong incentive for doing this for the source AES I mean yeah because you know filtering operation at the source AES incurs non negligible cost so really the source a is needs a strong incentive to do that but we don\u0027t have we don\u0027t see the strong incentive for this and worse yet there is a risk of dropping packets for the source on "

    "text": "behalf of others so at the end of the day the source is helping the destination at AES which is you know random guys on the internet and it the source is may be blamed for dropping its own customers packet at the end of the day so to that end we believe that in order to actually implement this source and filtering we really need to think about the collaboration rather than the outsourcing so what that means is that source and the destination is is collaboratively determining the filtering policies so if as you can see in this animation you know destination a s submits its own policy if you\u0027re doing policy to the source AES and at the same time source yeah yes submits its own policy its own filtering policy to this the the packet filtering mechanism and the those two policies are composed into the composed policy PSD here and this composed policy is used to filter traffic for the DDoS attack at the destination AES and we believe that this collaboration pure collaboration architecture provides a significant incentive to the source is because source a is now can express its own policy and for its own customers for example let\u0027s say the source AES has some premium customer or mission-critical service that he really wants to protect when there is an attack again attacks at the destination a yes and now the source has a opportunity is a capability to express that and really enforce that but as we try to really implement this you know pure collaboration operation we immediately faces a couple of security challenges first how to really how can we really guarantee the fare policy competition between the two you know so say yes and then destination a is and at the end of the day they are untrusted they they don\u0027t trust each other how can we do it in a fair manner second how can we protect the sensitive filtering policies from each other you know those two untrusted AES is I mean their own policies independently created policies and it is combined and in some way and how how do we guarantee the privacy of those policies and the third what if the source is who\u0027s actually executing the the filtering operation wants to bypass stuff packet filtering when it doesn\u0027t like the decision of the packet filtering so these three you know security concerns are really the major concerns we discovered and we\u0027ve we just summarized that I know a couple of desired properties for this so first property we really need to have here is what we call the verifiable fairness so that is policy composition of the two must be fair and verified by both source and destination aliases so again this is "

    "text": "a collaborate collaborate on platform not the outsourcing platform so the fairness really is the key between the two untrusted AES and by fair what we mean by is that we find we try to find a middle ground between the two policies two independent policies so in this very simple example on the left hand side there\u0027s a source a s source a yes may have four policies I mean I\u0027m sorry for flows and the top top one is the higher pass of higher priority and the bottom one was has a low priority you know for one ABCD and destination AES may have different policy in different order I mean for for simplification we we assume that they have same flow definitions but as a as we compose those two different policies we may come up with compose policy that is roughly in the middle ground between the two so that\u0027s the roughly the idea of course we have a you know better definitions in our working papers so that may be the more important part is that the 2a aces should be able to verify that the fair competition and enforcement of their policies are there and should be really verifiable by the two untrusted aliases so that\u0027s property number one and the second desired property is that filtering policy of each AES must be protected from each other with some prop privacy guarantees the reason is really simple you know filtering policies are inherently sensitive for example you know the the Preferences of the filtering rules could be from private contracts between aliases or propriety algorithms or the the policy rules may leak some of the attack information for example which is which customer is actually under attack or you know it may leak some vulnerable points of them their networks also it may leak some intern internal whitelist and blacklist policies of their you know that which they never want to reveal to any other AES in the world so what we want to have is just to have some negotiation mechanism - that guarantees some level of degree of privacy lastly you know third desired property is simply just to make this bypassed attack impossible so in other words sources may want to evade this this filtering policy but we need to have this what we call the number pass ability property so that any filtering operation must be invoked for all packets from sources to the destination a is so to that end we actually built a design and build this middle box based filtering mechanism and we believe that this is a really practical design choice for rapid and widespread deployment so in this simple diagram on the left hand side there\u0027s a source a is on the right hand side destination is again they are you know far away from each other they don\u0027t "

    "text": "trust each other of course and our idea is that we put the middle box inside the source IES and this can be very I mean right next to the egress router and simply they it receives two independent policies from the two networks source and destinations and the policies could be you know 5-tuple flow definitions and with some priorities it could be some other things but as an example that could be a policy and it is composed into the common policy and which can be fit into the classification and the rate limiters so there could be multiple rate limiters for each traffic classes and so what when this middle box receives the incoming packets from the source and to the destination again the destination is under attack and this nation is requesting some you know packet filtering and based on this composed policy they they block I mean they drop some of the packets in other words right maybe some of the packets and then the remaining packs will go to the destinations so it actually we built this everything with a commodity hardware and we could achieve multi gigabit per second throughput and the two major functions I mean control plane functions and data plane functions are protected within the trusted execution environment so trusted execution environment or te e is used because these capabilities the memory isolation or X isolated execution and remote attestation would be really really useful to offer security properties for that and in one of the the biggest one is a verifiable control and data plane operations so we we show that you know this te based middle box for the application of you know collaborative filtering can actually satisfy the three desired security properties if you remember those three I remind you the first one is that you know policy competition and enforcement of the of the two policies can be actually isolated and verifiable by the two aliases because every you know you know the executions of the policy competition and enforcement are protected by trusted execution environment and also this is is now can negotiate the desired level of privacy so for example if the source a is trying to learn the composed policy PSD here then he can actually try to do that we actually demonstrated that the attack is possible within less than 10 seconds but we also found that there is a trade-off between the anonymity and the fairness privacy and you know fairness and buy-in by writing down the exactly what level of privacy is is required by the two "
