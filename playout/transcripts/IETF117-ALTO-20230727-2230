So If we option it right now, it may discourage the deployment of auto. And the second is we got SSC is also being used in other RFCs. So it might still get some chances to be deployed. And then And, also, there's awesome dependencies between this document and RCA 95. So we we decide to keep it. And the second issue is for httV 2 and httV 3, there's a feature called server push. And in previous versions, we designed some mechanisms to leverage this feature at We got some pushback from post the review and also from previous, like, HPGR reviews. And the argument is server push is not a widely deployed. why they implemented feature. and to the gain of using server push is not a significant except for some extreme cases. So after the discussion and investigation on other programs such as Grpc and some others. We our approach always to move through a push feature into appendix. And the reason why we do not keep it in the main text is based on the arguments and feedback from the reviews, and the reason we did not remove it completely is because we still see some values of this server push feature.

It's the there's one implementer that said that the recently, they have this ACC, which is in their product, and you don't want that to to use it as as a negative thing for me, it is not, but I'm I'm hearing what they are seeing. So it's it's it's up to us to to see whether we can live with the, I would say, just the soft recommendation in the, I would say, in in the ECCC that's yeah. Mhmm. We know the ECC is there, don't recommend to use it, please use this one, but we don't accelerate it. It it just have the the trigger between the two of them.

We we could talk for a little bit longer.

Let's move on. And next is Adrian and we have the presentation. Yeah. for the mastery definition. Okay. I hope I'll do this quickly. I am a cat's cochair. What is cats? Cats is a framework for distributing computer network metrics In order to allowed the network edge to steer traffic to the appropriate server service instance to perform that compute function So it's not on path. And It's not client based. Next slide, compare and contrast this with the regular out of photo picture. I know there are other variants of this, but The the the essential here is that the host is being helped to make a decision"

There's a there's a potential and rather more complicated figure that we could draw Nobody's really proposing this at the moment, but you could see how auto and cats might go together so that the The host is making the or or the client is making the choice about the set of server instances to target, pushing that out as far as the the edge of the network And then then the normal cat's processing takes over. So key in this figure is that network information is being used by by cats on the the left on the right of the picture, and being used by the outer server on the left of the picture, And similarly, service based information is being used by cats. and by Alto server. So there's there's a pooling of or commonality of the trick information that's needed. we already know how the the network stuff works. And so the the big question is how do we put metrics in place for compute services in a way that cats can do it, and can we possibly do that in a way that auto would like. Next slide, So in incats, We're interested in the network staff, topology capabilities state, Part of that is latency, but that's all in the pipeline. We know how that works."

So we're only just starting to look at that. and we'll need to know things like What are the processes and what is their current load and their ability to process particular request and a particular time frame frame, We are guided by needing standardized metrics that everyone can under stand so that different implementations can all play as part of this ecosystem We want those metrics to be easily combinable and also easily combinable with the network metrics. What we've learned from traffic Engineering is that if you can manage to get your metrics very simple, then it's very easy to to proceed, if you get them complicated, you will probably burn. Net side, terrifying question. Are you an AD or a mem or a participant in the community? participant. Can you wait until I finish the slide? So It seems to me that There is quite a potential overlap on these compute metrics between cats and alto Alcher is quite possibly interested in this. And if if so, would it be nice if those metrics could be common across those those architectures. And I'm pretty sure that there's an understanding of server metrics in this community that"

Can you go back to the cloud slide one with all the diagrams, I I'm I'm a, like, a a dumpy speed guy. So when you have more than client in server, I get they get confused. this that box in the upper left says host which I think is the Alta client in this model, is that that's where the auto Yeah. That that's that's where time. Okay. So is that, like, a human being, or is that, like, an CDN steering thing that the ISP owns or What? I think I pick the word host deliberately here So I see this as something that's running an application. Like, an an end user device. Yeah. Okay. That's very interesting. Alright. Well, lovely. Because Alto I mean, all People associate a lot of concepts with Altus fundamentally API between some sort of network database thing and and a client And alright. Thanks. Joe? Drew, Huawei. One question, that comes to my mind is I totally agree that, like, metrics are common, so we need synergy. We don't want Same thing defined in 2 different working groups. But in this figure, is there a system in which Both Alto is making decision that there is an Alto client looking at information from auto server, making some decision, plus cats also making some decision. Or are they 2 different systems. Maybe the metrics are the same, but they are not working together. Right. So that's basically, the three slides I had were caps is on its own. autos on its own and oh, maybe."

So out out of the whole global conglomerate of service instances. Alto would be filtering down to, here's a pool to target, pushing that through and then the cats system is picking the individual one. Can Recha. you check if we can we can be quicker, please? Yeah. Please. time. Oh, okay. So I'll I'll try to be very quick. we run on I think Adrian, that's actually a very, very good comment. I think a metric would be very interesting. I just wanna clarify a little bit about the architecture you have in mind. For example, for a lot of steering things, for example, I always view, like, computing or where some kind of a load of balancer, for example, engines, something like that. Right? And oftentimes, the color metric would be something like, you know, you keep track of the current number or backlog of connections. So therefore and then you do a little for example, Will those type and then oftentimes a very common one. By the way here, I'm I'm high from from Geneva. from CERN. And, for example, a lot type of services selection is for example, here is you send some kind of pilots. You send the pilot. You want to issue an approval a little get a sense of latency computational latency on all the devices. and then they become part of latency. And if that's the case, then those information, if we inject into our auto then we're gonna have some some kind of real real time provisioning things. We either collect information from computing instance independently, and we'll merge them. or somehow become overall for some aggregate total -- latency. Oh, too long? Okay. Yeah. But overall, if you can clarify, of course, we can discuss offline."

And that's the thing we need to sit down and do. 1 So if it works with the chairs, what cats will do is come up with a couple of dates where think that an interim would be a good idea. float them to you and see how we can mesh. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Adrian, for one of our discussion. then Let's move on to the second part. So Here is the share view actually a little bit subjective. We think this auto has been around for a while. So we thanks to, you know, you know, auto design team actually is sustainable, you know, trustworthy work actually not just the defined standards, but also, you know, spin on the worker to fix the open issue on the GitHub defined also try to write a software to validate the standards. And, however, the decide the base Although, we see, you know, very few many extension hasn't been adopted. And a few determined discovered for many different reasons, and the new app applicable use case, continue being proposed So that's a current situation. And so this scenario we look at, not a you know, we local scenario, client can be the place on out of the host but also the autoclander can be placed in the edge node or operator. this just okay in mind."

We focus on auto maintenance fix the integration complexity, either integration with SalesOS second directing, actually, we content care are are our success to make an auto dominant. And With that, I want to move to AD, a few words that you Martin do have any comment on this part I I didn't have anything prepared. But sure. I mean, I I think your assessment's pretty accurate. I can see a gap in trying to aggregate this information into an auto database, I I also don't think that's Alto, and I am I really don't think that's something in the transport area. So so Rob Wilton here, he's the ops AD, so he's a little familiar with the ops or management AD. Sorry. It's an inside joke. I brought him here just to help me sort of evaluate these use cases Like, I almost I mean, if we wanna do a aggregation thing. I almost think we need to 10 likes the new working group.

Okay. so just as as chair, we are not, I would say, we are trying to be neutral on the directions, we are here in both both directions.

Next, we So Richard, and 3, Okay. You can the the first charter proposal, Sure. I'm not seeing my slides. Great. Can people hear me okay? Yeah. Just stick to your time, 5 minutes. Okay. I'll start. And my presentation is the is talk is to talk about force bound implementation. And we're focusing on using IETF mechanism. are many ways to build, like, for example, Martin mentioned, how to build auto database, We'll talk about evaluating how to build auto database or auto essentially information from IETF for making this is most focusing on the auto based services. It's bound to work, but mostly this one slide done by me, subbing, and and and and together. Next slide's fees. So if you look at overall the auto structure, essentially, we'll see I will see it consist of 3 components. The first one is the green one and the green block. is what do we call a Central North Bond. It would include a boundary of abstractions and services. and service provided by auto essentially, auto information, like cars and so on. and then you define the transport, and then you define discovery. The evaluation would be, this part probably is very well defined, and is quite a while specified. You give this specification and people can implement quite easily."

The major missing piece at least for more and more for people who are doing limitation and deployment is source bound somehow is missing. And, of course, we can see some sorts of essentially, there are 2 points of view 3 point of view. One is auto database somehow should be easy. and we turns out to be hard. The second point of view will be okay, and auto information probably should be secret sauce. and someone should really come as good a a way to compute the stuff and so on and really as we compete. But somehow, the prom turns out is even for a very basic standard auto metric. for example, standard and the clever engineering metrics. It's very hard to come short. Therefore, they really become a major impediment for the deployment of auto. Next slide, please. To be concrete, and here is a very concrete thing to talk how to implement a very basic auto cost service. So here is you have a networking limit. Imagine it's telco. It's network And your goal is very simple is you really have already configured the links, the metrics, all kind of metrics, standard metrics, for example, and delay and the standard t metrics. And you want compute the second author wants compute aggregate end to end metric. m for the given source, for given destination. It's a bit trivial, and it'd be very easy to implement. It turns out to be hard. Why? If you look at it, essentially, there are 3 subtasks. Number 1. And you have given source and worth ingress a point. It might come in from a prime or might might come from a. It's actually not easy. We'll see. The second one is you really need to find out the set of links quite worse. before we can compute the total house information. The network can be structured. For example, you might have a OSPF, Therefore, you might have area 0, for or 1, for example, then you compute path for me to be."

Maybe your IGP will pick a bukfg, But then you really have some kind of traffic engineering and will also create some kind of short and it become inside the BKF, it become BF. So therefore, those are the issues. And, of course, you can you can argue that, you know, this information is somehow owned by the devices, by same vendor. You can really do that. Actually, there's some vendor doing that work already, and you take all your files, if you come vendor specific, it's quite a complex. question is how do you implement it? Next slide, please. So this is one of the first major implementations it's really done by Benox. I believe it's really they they said this system has been computed. I believe the deployed in 15 networks, maybe 20 networks and and so on. So here is how they solve the problem. It's what we call essentially jouting system, listener, and sampling basic deployment. If you look at the upper left corner and a bunch of listeners, pairing with all kinds of rocketing systems. So what's the problem they're trying to solve? They're essentially trying to compute their routing state. and the links settling drivers. Do we have prompts? Yes. We do. For example, ITB passing period can be complex. There'll be all the structures. and then you have to also replicate all the behaviors from technology data. and you have a new traffic engineer and things continue to emerge, you know, me routing, and so on. Then second of course is you also have a lower left corner and all kind of x flow What they're doing, they're trying to compute a centric ingress point. And audio candidate sampling algorithms, for example, Xflow and so on, They must have traffic. Oftentimes, they don't go very well. Next slide, please. So next one is implementation really is really being deployed at the CERN at WSEG. and really based on persona data. And here it is, I'm not gonna go to all the details. So based RFC 792 and then 01, and so on. And you also have kind of use right, SAP, you have all kind of node aliasing, multi ads in primes. And then we're using perf sonars.

We're not gonna really like a ball ocean and look at all, like, if anything, wanna focus on computing auto based service. not all the fancy services, and providing only auto standard metrics. and only be using IETF standard mechanism. Three groups are interested, certain diversity, the auto server and a bunch of over here. And the second major deployment is Benox, and Danny and Ingama, they are they are the good supporting this one recorded on vacation will be a follow-up and so on. And third one, of course, is a is a telephonic car, and which is Luis, and all the kind of efforts. Some more details. For example, we wanna be focusing on using bdpris implementation.

We cover the topic about the of Alto by using BGP Communities. So next, please. So the the BGB communities are quite extensively used by operator, So, typically, we are by the means of the EPC communities, we aggregate summarizing the the point we we are getting, I think, and we can apply different policies. Typically, policies related to routing"

Altober is working with the concept of PID The PAD is similar to to the DAB community. a kind of aggregator or or grouper of IP preferences. Right? but, somehow, somehow, certainly, the the the way of aggregating APIs and communities is totally decoupled. So the the idea would be to extend Alto with the purpose of handling BDP communities instead of PID or complementary to usage of p of PIVs. So the BGP communities, as advertised advertise regularly by BEP messages. So the the point here would be to integrate I mean, to extend Alto to being able to pass the BDP messages integrating and processing the BGP Communities' information. So our subject is of this proposition of direction. will be will allow us to to process the community information from BGP. to provide the network an open map and the cost map based on BGP Communities. instead of the conventional PADs. and to facilitate the unfortunate duration of Alto in operational networks. So so how aligning the the way of running the the operational networks that are going in this direction of BDP communities. Please look the the figures so that the the the impact, let's say, of considering the GP community could be both in the server interface, so how to retrieve this information. passing the BGP messages for collecting this information, also in the processing. So in the data But in order to process this information for creating the different maps, and as well, probably, how to consume other information. So allowing the auto clients, to request the information to add to server based on BGP community. next, please. So they ask us that that we identify could be addressed in in this line of action would be how to use"

The the point here is that atatat we could play with an additional flexibility because as I said, BGP Communities is kind of grouping of IP prefixes. So we could have a relationship one to one. between BEP community and PID or 1 to n or n to 1. So there there is a flexibility we would need to deal with and understand what could be the implications. Similarly, yeah, how to retrieve the the VIP communities information. So either processing the EB messages either configuring the Alto server with the BGP communities maybe leveraging on the YEM interface in progress to become a IFC. or maybe other mechanisms that we could identify. Also, to analyze the impacts on the maps. So with this possibility of having mapping though, 1 BGP community to MPIDs. the the there is the possibility, let's say, of the situation of creating maps. from one origin, let's say, to many destinations or from many to many. So also, it's needed to understand what back with these implications on how this could reflect in the in the different maps. And finally, yeah, the BGP community representation in Alto. So how how to how to represent this in the format of the different objects. If they're representing this as an network element or in any other way of of representation. Apart from that, the the there. We can normal security considerations. of dealing with BEP Communities. Next, please. So as next steps, the yeah. We'll be to conduct feedback from the working group. and to consider this as a part of a new charter item of Alto regarding operational evolution. that probably could include maybe other aspects as well, like the security or so. and and basically, trying to ensure the interoperability between different implementation so that, yeah, we we can have this kind of a standard way of of working So, yeah, that's all from my side.

They did much aligned with this as well. So the interim, we discussed the the use cases quite extensively. So what I'm what I'm what we're presenting here is an abstraction of the use cases into this notion of service life life cycle. And here's sort of we do, like, gap analysis, if you will, So when you have a new service that you wanna deploy at the edge, the first step is deployment. So to make that decision of deployment, need to have information about communication cost and compute cost. once the service is deployed, then the next is to actually instantiate a service and and actually do the selection of the is And and so now let's you can see that service deployment first. who needs who needs the information in required, computing communication, who needs it is the service provider service provider using the network wants to know the complete capabilities, this this will be the complete capability capabilities as well as the communication capabilities, And we will we think that Altice ideal to provide this use case and implement this use case because that's the exposure of network information outside the network operator and into the service operator. as for the service selection. here,"

I think that's one the lessons where Luis talks about. The implementation is very, very unstable. and the pay people keep on adding new new stuff. So therefore, eventually, for ours, for example, we're looking at number 1 is we provide guidance. talk about, for example. Okay. If you add a new, for example, key component, should you tell us? And if, for example, our deployment, if you add, for example, a note that you add a new new stuff should we know from the source band?

I was trying to understand what southbound API would look like and what would what would be new. So we already have we already have beach PLS. We already have young models, loads of those being defined, loads by end as load by open config and postcodes getting that data up from the devices. We also have ip fix already defined. So we have already lots of this data that's available with APIs, standard API, standard yang models, take you a long time to get some of that and and get it upgraded together. We also have teams that are already working to sort of aggregate that data from those 3 sources into, so Apache Kafka, that work is happening in at the moment. so I'm wondering what what a southbound API would look And that's different from that? because if you're suggesting another protocol on the devices to support this data, I'd be heavily against that. So I think you be doing more work in the same same thing again. And then I'm thinking about, well, if the if the work is something sitting in the I don't know, Alto server that's doing this aggregation, what does that look like? Is it just saying pull this data from these places, or what what does that end up looking like? So I'm gonna give very shortly respond, and then I'm gonna ask Luis to give on as well. So, for example, a very quick short respond would be number 1, we're not proposing to do any, like, affordable work yet. And number 1, we're really looking at all the guy for example, the management protocols. For example, your go to network, you tell us you are running you should somehow guidance you should really like, for if you divide it into multiple areas, you wanna make sure you configure you know, all the, for example, GPUs in the correct way.

I actually really, really do it, like, for example, some fancier protocol work, for example. What I will look at a personal level for that, my total personal opinion is I don't believe actually the con control system would be stable. people would con continue to invent a new control algorithms. and the ISS and OSPF, and then you have example, all kind of signaling particles on top, and we have all kind of control But typical, actually, oftentimes, the control plan or the data path oftentimes is stable. most people. You're not gonna have a lot of evolutions very quickly. That's why, for example, essential argument or p 4 or or argument of software defined networking is that part oftentimes a lot more stable. We actually, even possible, can direct or polo's information. of course, not really by, for example, like, former network would really go there and proof, for example, the the complication files and then complicate that stuff. We want active mechanism, we're not proposing I could work implemented. We even have now have a very basic prototyping. It's we can conceptually even dump the forwarding table, and therefore, We can really do both of the technology and we can also do, for example, sort of it's a lot more stable, essentially, is you do all the fancy computation. You do all the all evolution, but we fetch it. So therefore, we can make the note. Thank thank you, Richard, for for clarifying. Yeah. So yeah. Just just to to provide more clarification beef before giving the floor to you to to do it. is actually in the current OMO that we have in the Alto, the the way this is glued to the data source is out of scope. So that part is really missing on. If you want to add the F Four integration, there will be some modification to be done into that that data model. This is kind of standard are really missing. is more operational. This glue is currently out of scope because of the scope, this is a working group. this is one of the, I would say, tracks that the the group is currently proposing. Dwisp, please."

But we need to process them trying to represent it to the Alto stuff. So they all did. And so order to generate later on the integrated information that we can expose outside to the the applications could be aspects that probably there is no solution yet. That could be the the case, as Adrian was mentioning, the cabinet the computer work metrics. And so priority for that, we can figure out how we could collect Maybe not the standardized, but understand what kind of metrics we we can be retrieved from whatever system on So so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so But for all data models, for sure, the objective is to reuse that. simply the point would be how to integrate that into the auto object so that we can represent it. At reality, example, as for instance, the performance So we are collecting the performance metrics from IPPM and so we integrate that with the topology with the the finding the way of how to glue all this information together in the international of so that the the cost map can represent performance based experience. So we are not recommending the metrics. or we are not remoting the way in which we can collect the metrics. That's simply how all the information together Okay. And I and I don't know Alto, so that makes me it puts me this partnership, but is that something that's worth standardizing? As in are you deploying Alto already or using Alto, Have you already already doing this for the metrics you care about. And I don't know with Alto whether its data formats are like or how constrained it is it something where the operators and and the people deploying Alta will choose exactly which things they want to go into it. they'll just get that data and put it in. So in order to try and work out what the value is, in standardizing that commonality. I mean, if if Josh's gonna say, get data from these possible sources and put it in, that has relatively low value to me. So it's I still just struggle to see what the with values."
