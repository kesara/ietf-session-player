Novik put together in a bullet eyes forum the general section the made the description of the need for maintenance and then the work that\u0027s being done currently that\u0027s under that we which has been discussed today on extensions and just the motivation behind them to me makeup what is the body of the proposed new charter for the group and I personally don\u0027t find anything controversial in there because of two things it\u0027s covering the fact that yes if we are a working group still formed we are here in part to maintain the existing standards and there is current work going on the work that\u0027s going on is "

David black they were but I think I mostly got up to plus form what you said BP which is I like the Charter text one milestone is not enough but figure out the milestone so that makes sense based on drafts and I think also probably ought to take the discussion here about a draft to go rewrite seventy five thirty security considerations section two of the list and see was to see if it still still makes as much sense in a week from now as it did as it did in the last thirty minutes I would also want to say with my blue dot hat on as one of Spencer\u0027s uh chairs of chairs another working group Spencer has been very very flexible about milestone additions date change "
