    "text": "we the draft itself is very heavy on anti-abuse and we don't capture a lot of the other use cases of ip addresses and so we're going to look for other other people who are interested in talking about how they use ip addresses and what what blockers they see for accepting accepting clients over ip privacy or over private ip connections and through that we're going to iterate on signals and the draft itself is becoming quite long in uh complicated so we'll probably look at refactoring and making it easier to comprehend and we're also going to look at and continue to be involved with other groups within the itf and w3c and then various standards working groups there's recently uh anti-fraud community group launched at the w3c that we're interested to see what comes out of that and then in terms of open questions uh and issues obviously going back to refactoring just like what is the scope of this draft and and what what should be included for the within the purview of prg and and just what's generally useful um as an example of of open issues there's a question of mandatory signals this is obviously very contentious because we're trying to get away from mandatory signals with you know passive uh passive semi-stable you know ip addresses but uh on the other hand um malicious behavior and just general bad actors take advantage of not having a mechanism to re re-identify them so that's uh and then they're just general github issues which go into some of those issues and others and that's uh that's my update so happy"
