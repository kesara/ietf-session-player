    "text": "so why do we knew this yes so this I touch base last year last idea but again I\u0027ll and summarize here the first point is it reduced the path overhead on the data plane you you can put everything on the data plane everything on the packet but there are some issues with that so for example you have the hardware capabilities let\u0027s take about SR the MPLS case if you talk about multiple labels you already have without any SR path 6 MPLS labels on the packet you already end up in 4-5 labels how it is that you have VPN label interests label most cases 2 labels and on top of it if you\u0027re smoothly tunnel traffic to dip into the packet into inside you need entropy label for and the path label eventually so for filing fortify labels and if you have Broadcom chips I\u0027m sorry for that you cannot put more labels on that but maybe in future new chips may be available it can do more but if if we put services if you put everything and if you put in ring topologies everybody every label you have to describe it\u0027s going to be 10 to 12 watt 15 I don\u0027t know how many labels one needs it so MSD fixes is this in the sense like you know it at least for the controller it will help you to understand okay don\u0027t use this part because I have a small router here it cannot read these many labels so it can avoid that path temptation so it is a constraint on the PCE but it cannot give the alternate path which is giving the similar traffic characteristics you are seeking to start with it also once you reduce a packet overhead you obviously get the line rate there are line rate issues otherwise some hardware\u0027s cannot do line rate if you put large overhead it in the packet and for a service 6 case it avoids fragmentation it\u0027s a serious problem and you hit this fragmentation issue it should be seriously will be in trouble and the last thing for the lot of Phi G use cases em IOT and you are ll see packet sizes are small it\u0027s 40 bytes 30 to 50 bytes packets you cannot put a header tax of 200 vice 100 bytes for the packets for that environment it is sensitive for some environments it\u0027s not sensitive yes if it is environment it sends to then too much packet overhead is a problem so it also simplifies so a.m. it extends the data planes you can you add more data planes and also it unique fast gyro it can be done with this next slide please so a lot of people asked for the how it is backward compatible or how it works with SR I says it\u0027s complementary it\u0027s it\u0027s a complementary control in work it works great with a sir it\u0027s an optional feature if you want to use for SR MPLS and SH you can reduce the stack size and you don\u0027t have to use it and if you have to do network programmability and if you want to do a extension it a lot of stuff there you can go ahead and do it but if you are using only for the path information if you want to compress that you can use this optional feature it works there "

    "text": "fully backward-compatible next slide please so there was a question on the scalability there will be millions of paths see how thousand no network thousand links you have four million part and paths so theoretically yes there will be millions of flows not millions of paths there will be a few thousand parts in some in some environment even lesser so it is simply scale is PPR path road is a scale number of routes a number of routes into the IGP so you don\u0027t have to scale the answer is yes you don\u0027t have to scale yes there are possibly theoretical possible but you don\u0027t have to skin that much so the only thing is we are looking for is how we can reduce the global srgb usage the seats are premium because global seats are very few so that can be optimized so with this we could introduce the new draft the draft draft I\u0027ll talk about it next slide so basically what we are doing is in this instead of a linear path we call this as a branch so we introduce two bits one is source and destination so for example PDE one is a source ingress v pd v is digress PA so if you are crafting a path PD on PD two you describe the path but if you just put add two bits like for example PDE one is a source in the figure PD three is a source two and the Green was the destinations so four paths can be compressed into one for example PD one from source if for each source expanded to each destination so every destination should contain a forwarding entry so the forwarding entry can be established so simple with simple bits you can extend it to you can compress it and if you don\u0027t want to mean a scale you don\u0027t have to use this but you know it\u0027s a simple feature it can use it and also you can the same concept can be extended to build the graph and this will even further compresses it is that the details are in the draft so the use cases we are looking at is actually low latency use cases so low latent low and deterministic latency use cases lot of use cases the verticals these use cases and requirements are covered in the HC working group and GP working group this was sponsored by water phone BT and BASF folks and this has a lot of use cases white is required and we it is applicable why the stack size is a problem next slide please and there were questions on what is the relation with the Phi G DM M working group work and this work so I presented the first draft DM empty a transport aware mobility in ietf one or two in DM and working group so what it lays out is in the Phi G how mobility can be achieved with the awareness of the transport network in the Phi G lot of small says new mobility scenarios are coming up and with the new online interface so when mobility sessions are taking care taken you need to account for the transport path characteristics too if the path is available or not so that is one piece and also there are other other work going on in the DMM to remove gtp "
