    "text": "so i think this is a good procedure for managing the job submitting to the working group i agree with that but i think that in our charter there's also a statement say that you know the six of long tools basic input from the operators and users and if we insist that you know well if you want to provide input you must have a duet then i think like this can be limiting to us so here i want to propose that it makes sense for the meeting presentation i'm only talking about the meeting presentation for example in the future can we always have two sessions in each iepf so we we add another session and then we invite you know some other for example either operators or users or even ipv6 deniers who talk about why you know what kind of challenge they see because for example recently there's this big debate in nano right about the the use or not use of 240's last fall a lot of people making leagues are saying that oh you know that you know i6 you know there are so many challenges um you know if you stop these skills you'll spend half the time the you know patching ipv4 on ipv6 ipv6 but we are not really acknowledging that you know the the sharing they see so i wonder if it makes sense for example to to add one more session in each ietf because there are a lot of interest on ipv6 there are a lot of challenges and this way we can bring more input you know kind of like identify the challenges more so that we can ietf can"
