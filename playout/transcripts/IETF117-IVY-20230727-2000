The key point I want to emphasize is Although the the chances to covers look at imagery the industry Yang more generally is quite focused initially, and we're trying to get this common part of imagery, Yang Sorted. So unlike this short term focus on being to get that initial milestone sorted. then after that, we'll look at how to extend the working group and what it should cover.

Welcome, everybody. some info. on on the working group. So, I mean, thanks a lot for for for the intro. Weep we just put together a few a few lines to remember everyone why why this working group was created, what's the scope, what's what is not. So why the working group was was created me the main reason was that there was the need for that. there was a proliferation of very good documents and material in working groups and in different areas. So was the needed to do a little bit of of coordination. find what is as our charter says, a common umbrella to facilitate the distribution of the work clarify the scope, does what, etcetera, etcetera."

But let's start from something simple, basic cup, that then could be augmented in many, many different ways to add a lot of nice and fancy capabilities. What else? again, here, we we copied we we we quoted our charter. Derived common building blocks of our inventory model that can be augmented imported or used by other IETF models. So this we will discuss this a little bit in the next the next few minutes. The idea is to build these core based model that everyone can use and augment them. Possibly with together with the and how to So provide guidelines on how to use it First of all, We have seen that there is a plenty of nice fancy models, but sometimes hard hard to understand that not to use So that's why probably spending a little bit of effort on on explain how to augment how to use this model. would be would be beneficial mostly for the for the newcomers. you click the next piece, please, please?

Well, other things in scope. hardware inventory, software inventory. actually, if I'm not mistaken, as of As of now, we have a lot of a lot of material covering hardware inventory. a little bit less on software. So possibly, it would be great to cover to cover bot both both topics mapping. So We have in the IETF produced a lot of a lot of modalities so far as so far, so far topology because this is a lot of topology models. building, or explaining how the the inventory maps against all these existing models would be extremely beneficial for for for the consumers of of this model. What is not in this scope? how this model is is used. So This is something that at least for the moment that we decided to keep outside the scope of our work. However, chart test can be updated. I've been working in Ccamp for 15 years, and we have a charter update every 2nd year. So That's that's something. If you believe that your idea fits into the working group should be there. we can discuss our chartering at any time.

Then that other part is part of inventory. No. It's not. These are the risks. So we definitely need some terminology and and a clear scoping of what is inventory and what is not. As I said before, hardware and software components should be should be covered in our model. Physical locations. This is another thing that we felt the needed to call out explicitly because it's it wasn't covered in in the material that is already there in in the various graphs. Multilayerandmulti domain. This is something that fits very well with our digital map work. So we we would like to understand how the different pieces fit together. also from an inventory point of view.

I think the physical link 1 has 2 issue here right now. when we are modeling this because the first thing is the 83 Office 8345 They're currently supports only unidirection link. that is one part part of of of of difficulty, The other part is that from like, implementation perspective, like, these links It's they are passive inventory, you know, that that controller cannot be, like, easily to to get this information sometimes is manually configured from the system sold. That's the reason. I I think this is important, but I I see that it made some kisses. This is optional 1. My personal view is I I think you are up will be right in terms of uninteractionals. So when we add bidirectional, hopefully, I think, potentially, you could use them and I agree that they maybe use the defined links but we may not may need to have some kind of information about what the intent of the topology of the physical topologies versus you know, just collection from the operational status.

Is it a one network instance that you are talking about? Yeah. I I I think I can we can talk this. offline. Next. Oscar. Hi. I was calling Telefonica. So I guess the for the very first fundamental step that we need to do in the working group is is to define with with with which is the foundation of the inventory if if the topology the foundation of the inventory, or we prefer to have a separator structure and then link it to the to topologies. it it I started, like, we implemented in telephoning our inventory, and we started doing our first version, and we used the ATF network at the very beginning. and and and Okay? it wore a no, and then it confused a lot. people in Telefonica, and they forced us to say no. Please. put it in a separate thing and link them. So we had to and birthed and berthed the path.

Robert? Okay. Roblin Rob built in Cisco as a participant. wanna make one mind one minor comment is somebody I think recommended using something like physical interfaces as as a name or to identify things. It's just worth pointing out that if we discussed earlier that virtual devices are in scope, then those virtual buses weren't half disciplined spaces. So we need to choose terms that are generic enough, but still specifically have to be understood. I do appreciate that naming stuff is where everything slows down. k. Ahmed that has any Swisscom, I have some one question about the definition that you have in the draft and here, you're defining the inventory as a list of mids connected to another to a network. that means anything that's not already connected is not part of the inventory. Like, type of backup device in my warehouse, That's not inventory. if I follow this definition. which I found it a bit, confusing. I think it should be including that as well. And it goes back to our comments as well. Like, in in the previous what we did is inventory is the things just listing the things that we have at the moment. how they are connected. That's part of the topology. That's part of your configuration. it's that's not to the inventory. That's Yeah. This is also a good question. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. way already, like, reduce most of parts of those entities already in ITAP hardware. Chicks, James coming up here. Had one question you I saw we had licenses in this model as well. And I know in the scope for the working group in general, that was mentioned of a software inventory too. It seems like it might be sensible to pull that out into a software inventory that could potentially then be augmented into this as needed. at various points of the tree rather than embedding it specifically in currently in the overall node. and where it may not apply depending on the buildup of the the node. Yeah. So it a comment on this So so so During during the week, I added the opportunity to talk to people in the corridors, etcetera. And the the most common feedback was guys, this is useful if it's done quickly. So this means that probably the the the the process that you are proposing is the right one to to start with something simple, basic, and then build on top of that.

The approach is basically to start from the current model work on generalizing some of the companies, we can see around in the details and to try to go into an approach that can be done in a step by step. data. So we can focus now on developing a base model that covers hardware inventory and for career networks. But making sure that the issue is the actions can be done through better compatible changes to support softer license and enterprise networks. So we don't want we want to make sure that whatever we do now is not going to block the future evolution but we don't want to delay the work that is required that as you would need to until all the future evolution are are are or at clear it up. And the the the the the this extension can be done either to new revision or through augmentation, this is a AI model options we can discuss. indicator, what is important that we over now, we we can now that this extension can be done in the back of compatible"

We post to change the name of the router, from IETF network, hardware network inventory to IETF network inventory. So the the new root will have a broader scope than just hardware inventory. So you can add a softer component under the same root. We'll we have some also discussion in our in our concept that they keep me room is very useful concept for other inventory in the current report, but if you start to generalize situation. You may end up you we have noticed that there are other type sites. So we we will plan to generalize the list of the human rim to become sides them. and the sites will have a typer and camera room may be the 1st type of the 1st type of site that we address in this graph, new type of sites can be added later on because we can define in the entity and we can create a new entity in the future. A new size specific attribute. And one idea was also that some sites can also be a recursive when a site can be a building or can be a a a campus or a room, and you can have the campus content build, these abilities contain rooms. So we if we make this more generic that we make it more more future accessible. And the the idea is to keep at this moment in time out of the scope or from the base model that the items that require further discussion, like a soft drink components, license, evaporator elements, or other type of sites which are not working out in details like the chemo rumor. But make sure that what we do today is open to add these new stuff in a DC way. such that is not a road blocker to the future evolution which can go we can progress in parallel with our rafter. The only issue that we think has to be addressed now because it's basically difficult to resolve in the future as well that the least of fiber and co and software components have to be 2 separately all only one list of Let's make this difference in the name.

Otherwise, we need to enhance that tie this data change is the timing of the compatible if you want to add the software in the future. So that's why I think we need to of this issue now, Kobbei, Next slide, Okay. Another important design characteristic of our model In our draft is the navigation from the inventory to apology. So we added a new module, which allow navigate, for example, between a node in a topology and the network element in the inventory between an NTP in the topology and the port component that support the LTP in inventory. In the future, we have we plan to add the fiber and k buss to them, and we have not yet done, and then we can an an an aggregation between the link, the apology, and the cable, the support this link. the approach that we propose is to keep and to separate an inventory from the the the inventory aspects from the functional aspects. So the the the node, the the link, and the FTP, I have provide some functions, a layer 0, a year 1, a year, 2 layer 3. the component is the same, and you characterized what is the the the functionality of the component through the topology or In other case, you can use also an interface model."

But I think if you take the core of that out and put you in here, that's gonna naturally slow things down.

And so I think my questions up to you are is How quickly do you need the current module to be finished, do you need that to be published as an RFC or is an agreement as this is the base structure sufficient, is my second question. And the third one is is another choice could be to publish the existing one in the existing namespace and maybe Mark is experimental to get that out the door and done as is a temporary thing. So we know it's temporary. It's so you can use it, but we know this is where the gonna be, and then sort of decouple the 2 so you don't have the time pressure. So any thoughts either to Utalo or to the chairs, seat camp chair as well. on that. like that. Business. Well, okay. That's a good question. I'm Maybe this is a question I have to pass to the operators But my feeling is that I would like to have a stable rough it's stable mode that that that is future proof. So it's not something like experimental that needs to be placed in in in few months, but maybe I will pass this question to the operators working on the raft My my I do expect they want something more they want something more stable, not something Terima. And then normalizing, you can have good fast with chi choose any 2. So Well, what what what -- That's the shape of the What we try to get here was to see if we can have a a modular approach. such that we can go through the other solution now and add the missing pieces in BC Way later on. the and the only thing and this is up for chest control.

It doesn't have to be decided right now in this room, but that's the options that I see. Okay. So but just the just the comment So the experimental track sounds sounds interesting. The only thing is that I agree with Bitalo I mean, that that that would be something temporary because once we build our model Most likely, the c cam stuff will be the top of and make it experimental obsolete I guess. So the idea that I had in mind was to carve out from the second draft, whatever is good, and move it move it to Ivy. I I would given the fact that in order to be successful, we needed to be quick I would I would try to avoid having technology technology specific parts preventing the core model to to move faster example. if we keep all all all of that stuff in in in the core model, and that there are issues there that prevent the core model to to to go through, that would be that would be a pity. So, again, this is something this is just a a first reaction to to to your comments, and that's something that takes a little bit of a more cycles to take a decision.

But when I look at the other one, it seemed to come flate more other use cases. There was more of an agenda of other things happening there, and it was kinda hard for me to distill the inventory bits. I I saw things like management IP address, and Now I can't remember something, but but I looked at this one. I said, yeah. This is This is hardware inventory. You had some things like voltage there. You thought about references between things. I I think this is a really good first step. And and to me, in my head, It makes for a good basis for what inventory can be. And then you can start bringing in some of these other things where they fit augmenting some of the more software centric elements like you have board revision. You have, like, software and firmware type things in there. I again, just a guy, I think this just resonated a little bit better with me. Thank you. Thomas Kaufman. Yeah. just commenting on my previous comment on the on the speed. I think really we should differentiate between, like, an intended speed, or capacity versus like the physical capacity. So I see on your graph in the direction you target is also capacity planning. So and if we compare the 2 drafts, you know, you have a more like an intent approach versus a more hardware approach. would really look forward if we can combine that somewhat so that we can clearly see what's physically available, what's the how much do we want to provision and how that's"

Helenity, you need we discussed as a digital map. How do you navigate? That was the question we had. We have a top inventory. We have a topology. We need to navigate between the two.

In terms of this work, the the DNA work or Alamo work I spoke to well, he's one of the authors suggesting that the doctor quite long and complicated and didn't show whether people really understood what it was.

And but the you know, through the the side immediate sizing, actually, we actually saw now that, you know, some okay elements could be put into this network inventory, food on for hardware inventory data such as sensor memory disk drive and software and inventory data such as switch router firmware image as, you know, Diego mentioned and Also, could be the OS and boot loader. And, also, the device could be the physical device and such as your network device or IoT device. It's actually in a campus scenario or enterprise. scenario. So the narrow inventory data could be placed in the cloud also can be in the on premise and And also, we can represent the physical location, either user side the room racks, and also we can use geolocation to represent this physical location. And we didn't talk a lot about, you know, how to, you know, identify the dynamic memory in the silent meeting, but Usually, actually, you just manually register this network inventory data or you can use some probing technology to automatically connect all of these data"

The first is device component addition and a change in tracking, especially in some campus or network and enterprise scenario, you may, you know, need to keep track of, you know, what a, you know, device really, you know, get added in the network or you need to figure out what kind of that device type has been removed or retired from the network device. So This really have you, you know, better understanding currently don't know the safety and also reliability plan sports. 2nd is the software component update. Actually, you need to monitor set of software changes that it installed. Actually, before you install this software change, you need figure out whether this software updated need to comply with relevant license agreement. For example, you need to track the exploration date of license agreement. and also you need to figure out a software component which is in use and which is not in use. Next. So we come to the 3rd use case, the hardware component actually. Suppose you really want to, you know, plan the physical both or physical component in some data center network or room room. Actually, you need to figure out, you know, the number of the hardware components can be placed in a specific rack or shelf or you need to specify physical size for each component. that meet you's it's basically good, you know, criteria And, also, we can sync forward use, you know, consider at least energy monitoring control use cases, actually, this and maybe motivated by this environment that impact, you know, discussion and So not only you can monitor the energy state and energy consumption for each metal element, but also you can, you know, monitor energy power state and energy consumption for each fix hardware component."

And together with, you know, like a network level model, like a L3m, L2m, And so This all of these model can be freed down into 3 layers. service level, network level, and device level. And You can, you know, establish this correlation model relationship using correlation method either you call it based on the mapping or you can, you know, establish the correlation based on the augment, one typical example, correlation based on the mapping. For example, you can define separate t service matting model, or slice service mapping model to map a service model into the device model. So a typical example of the correlation based on argument that you use this ietceter model as a basis, you can you know, expand it from it, you know, support the aerosary. topology, t, topology, and also network inventory. And So For some cases, if you really map, you know, service model into the device model and sometimes these Actually, we make assumption, maybe leave some vendor or operator to just to to decide how do you do this kind of mapping.

Bottom 2 layers. or actually relate to nanometer infrastructure. So this actually, you know, show show the, you know, basis of network network inventory. So in the right figure, actually, you can see there's some ITI worker called the network device younglogic organization. This actually is working with channel hasn't got published by set a good example of how can, you know, encapsulate that conversion model at the device level. So Under the in capacitization layer, you have logical network element. And this could be, you know, virtue neutral over to fiber. Next, So based on this, you know, nano device autonomy, today, you really can think of, you know, what is in the scope of IV core model, actually, such as, you know, physical nanoment but also logicalnanoment. And for each nano element that you can comprise the hardware component. And also, system software component, another another you know, you know, all the software component. So based on the prefix figure, actually. We we show, actually. But then in build on top of system software, you may have some applications software. We think that this is not in the scope model, and hope and hope and hope also fires and IP address and IDIT.

By the way, now, we don't have this logical network inventory model. Next I wanna talk a little about, you know, correlation mapping with other model you know, gave us several examples, for example, nanotechnology and the network device generation management, SAP, and attachment circuit model. Next. So we already discussed this, you know, how to correlate with is topology. As actually, we have 2 option either you can, you know, extend it from IDFnetworkmodel and the built on top of this and the network topology. or you can grab the nano inventory to the, you know, topology model. I think there's a pro and a call for each option, and but we think, you know, option 1, actually is the most straightforward mostly. This allow you more easily to map to the, you know, with topology expansion, And next, So how to correlate with network device or whether we need to correlate with nanodevices. So know, inventory really manage your favorite component or hardware component for network device model, you comprise, you know, a a a set of, you know, device lateral in a comparison model and In some case, actually, it doesn't need to tie them together. the the reason is, for example, you have BGP in the phase conversion model, this doesn't need to, you know, tie it to specific how do I get a component? or software component. 2nd is, you know, hardware,"

Anna I think that actually we have many way, actually, to establish this kind of mapping. We can use some some other model like, you know, alarm model or incident model. Maybe in the contact contact tracing model in another call three steps, you know, figure the failure completion failure and hardware malfunction. Next, So How do you do the correlation with the SAP, actually? SAP we assume, actually, both natural inventory and asset can be, you know, expanded from the network item network model, actually, they will be easy to establish this kind of mapping we can consider to have like a physical port in the network. basically natural inventory, so it will easy to establish the mapping with SAP like, you know, parent, the termination point, and So this is the idea Next, So so similarly,"

Actually, I think, you know, IV should, you know, really steps, you know, common definition for the nano inventory and this includes some terminology, we should, you know, reach your agreement on the same page, actually. And second, actually, IV actually focused on, you know, metal inventory monitoring at the current stage we also need to think forward how this network inventory can be managing, you know, user to manage it, not just the hardware, but also system software component. So green energy and monitoring could be the use cases, And And also IV, actually, I think, currently stethoscope to the you know, call network inventory model, and we think yeah. We need to think, you know, how we can, you know, establish the correlation on mapping between these network inventory call model and also logical network inventory model. currently, we don't have such kind of model. to model all the results or capacity. for issue resource IP.

What about devices that are very simple? What about devices that need to support virtual routers or whatever logical network functions of the LNEs, I think, are calls. So do we build a structure have that in or not. An open configs on the approach that they have this structure that's designed around quite complicated network device, and you have bits that aren't enabled or not. whereas the IETF solution was to go the other way and try and keep the modules quite rooted at the top and simple and then to use Yang Mount to sort of bring them together sorry, scheme amount -- Yeah. -- to bring them together and build more complex complates hierarchies. And the bit of that that I like in terms of the IT approaches It felt to me like it has more flexibility because you can piece a different together, and I think that that is helpful. So In terms of what you're presenting, how things fit together, I have a slight leading to try and not have things grouped too much and to keep them rooted in separate top level hierarchies. might be better. And the other thing that I was thinking about in terms of what we're presenting and that might actually apply to this work is whether you should be trying define a grouping of inventory so it can be reused in other places. And maybe, again, I don't know if it would quite tie in what's been done on the devices, but that grouping could be reused in different places.

I completely sympathize with the desire to have an inventory of what in the warehouse. or maybe in the van on the way to the data hut or or sitting in the cupboard somewhere but I keep running into the word network as in the top of this slide, network inventory function. And I think we need to be clear on our scope whether we're doing an inventory of what is actually deployed, not necessarily switched on, but deployed in the network and able to be switched on compared to what is on its way to being deployed. I'm not saying one the the the the warehouse and stuff is out scope, I just need us to be clear as to whether it is in Scratch. In Scratch, that's probably That in effort to add the get another status.

And hence, you potentially somebody could come along and use it for these other use cases, and we wouldn't know we wouldn't care. In terms of the sort of documentation goes around the model that's describing how it's used, think that should definitely be focused on the network use case. And I can't remember in the charter whether we are clear about whether the network inventories is just the stuff that's coming off what's actually deployed deployed and running as in you go and query it from the devices. They give you their what their inventory is. You're aggregating that up together into a high level model at the network layer what I had in my head, but there's also the valid use case of saying, well, actually, want to configure that network inventory up front because I know what's gonna come along, what's gonna be there. I put stuff that in there that's not yet provision. That seems reasonable to me, so I can see it can have those 2 sides.

So, basically, the network devices up to the level of the controller. But anything that would be at a level of the OSS I I think that they were getting really into team forum, etcetera, and then I would rather, actually avoid that, and then we would get actually the lot more additional functions.

On this discussion on the plan deploy that we have an open issue in the c camp GitHub. may not be as trivial as appears at the beginning because because you we have different type of mismatches. You can have an empty slot where you plan to add a new board. or you can have a a law a board that deployed in a in a in a slot that is tough to be empty. But in most complex, when you plan to have a a board x, and you actually have deployed a word why. And my comment on the guitar was maybe we need to have a 2 2 separate lists. I remember, a Nagel commented or the tagel remember is comment. it's an issue we are discussing so we can"

We are discussing this idea whether it's already deployed, and it's good to get the feedback, and maybe we need talk about also what is planned, and then we need to figure out the problem of the mismatches. But if this mesh can happen everywhere in the air clip, if I have a a board with 2 daughter boards, And I have actually inserted the board, expecting that I have one board with 2 If I have the project board without the the board and maybe 4 direct parts, then the tree is clack is clearly different. So it's not that trivial as it appears. So we need work out the solution. If there is a real requirement, we we are will welcome to do that. The second issue, we have to be careful when we talk about inventory. There is a lot of data which is not exposed on the interface. but is written manually in the database. And, also, that discussed a lot, and we thought we think this out of scope, the this standardizing the the the internal database of USS, all the inventory database in the USS. What we need to standardize is the YAM model where where we providing we feed the information from the controller do the access, not what is inside your access database. And, also, this a boundary that we need to clarify. Thank you. So now the most difficult part. wrapping up. Wrapping up. Thanks, team. How do we proceed them? at having a having a different everyone submitting is where her contribution would would be a nightmare because in the end that we would need to merge to merge draft. So probably starting from a single dot to where everyone attend contributor from the 8 0 would be would be the best option. L3 and m have been a source successful with the operators driving driving the work. if we manage that to find the same arrangement, that would be great. This this doesn't preclude the vendors to contribute and being listed out, those authors, etcetera. But"

So so I mean, I I'm not saying you, you, and you, will be the the the the drivers of the work, etcetera. this is something that will will be will be decided by by by the different participants in the working group. So that's no one will force anyone. From an operation, point of view, as Robert suggested, that we will arrange interim meetings to speed the things up between now and I anticipated what you were saying, We will we will try to have at least a couple of interim meetings in between. any And it's something you would like to share I speak too much. I don't know. Yeah. I I think I think have a lot of good discussions today. Just hope anyone can continue your discussion on the mailing list, and we will finally reach consensus or the mailing list. So any question I had in terms of processes was whether do one or two interims or you want to just sort of set up like, weekly meetings or biweekly meetings or something like that, I'll leave that up to you to figure out what the best thing is, but I think there's energy here to get going. I think there's energy here to sort of try and get the core bit done quick clearly. That is also in our milestones and things. So I just don't want us to sort of get slow go into that 4 month cycle stuff because because I've got other drafts like that, and it's not fun. Okay. So for the first time, it was pretty successful, I would say. Thanks a lot, everyone, for for participating for giving your contributions and the sharing ideas. And let's see in Prague. Thank you, everyone. Goodbye."
