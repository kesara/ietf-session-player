I see that there are some people online, it's late or early, so welcome to everybody. So I'm Benoit Clays, and we have molyukada. Met So do you want to be in next slide? Please. So we this is one of the first session of the week, and I see some people that are new the IETF here. So it's a good time to, to mention a note well, As a reminder, or if it's new to you, by participating in the IETF, you agree to follow the IETF process and policies, if you are aware of any patterns of patent application, you should close that or not participate the discussion You acknowledge that written audio video and photographic records may be met Public. Personal information that you provide to the ITS be handled in accordance with the ITS privacy statements. On the next slide, There is a note really well. That, we intend to have those meeting in professional networking as defined by the IETF guidelines for conduct and procedures. If you have any concerns about that, you might talk to the investment in which people of many different backgrounds and identities are treated with dignity. Distency and respects. And we must not, in a nutshell, engage in any harassment what are the IPF meeting it will not happen during the week or in this working group. So make sure that you sign your data tracker"

If you want to discuss, you could join the microphone queue from a button in me to go. If you're locally here, it means you'll be in the in the queue here and make your comment or provide your feedback. Same thing for the people online. There is also a tool called show of hands in which we could participate to, surveys. The agenda Well, we've got 4 big topics as described in the charter. This is the agenda online here, any agenda bashing. Alright. Hearing none. On the next slide, This is like a brand new working group created by our beloved AD, Rob Wilton, for a couple of days and he wants to say a few words about, the the charter itself. Yep. We're showing new slides. So it sounds better. Okay. So, just few words. I try not take too much time on. So first of all, thank you for everyone who's helped chartering this. I'd say thank you, to the chairs for stepping up. We've got 2 experienced chairs here, so I think that's a really good start. Help sort of set us in a good direction. Also, I'd say thank you to Thomas. The chair's appointed as the workroom secretary, so he's new to this role. So help Thomas as you can, but I think that's great.

So that's one of the things that this work group is intended to try to address and charter. For the, for the, the area of network management operations. So We were seeing operators self organizing, the previous active meetings and doing lots meeting to presenting topics and things, and part of that is to try and pull that into better way into the item process so that they can actually get gender time get people get people into the room, have all the myths and things like an associated AV stuff that goes well with his meetings. That was one of the parts of things. The other aspect in terms of the chart, and I want to go through, this tech let's go into, like, slide 3 Coming up here. Yep. So one of the things that's portal in this chart actually is that we have a focused list of topics We have some things that we said, like, in rough priority order. And so, in terms of the sort of topics it's focusing on, it's really about trying to, how do you, help better deploy existing network management technologies. So when you're finding issues as the operator and deploy IETF protocols, how do they actually address these issues? Some cases, those can go back to the working groups and then you and, developing those protocols. But in other cases, we have issues that are more wide spanning across that, and we want to have an area, we want to have have discussion of those issues and, find potential solutions. And part of that, when we have these discussions may be running short term experiments as, driven by the operator in terms of this is how we think you're deploying this and be able to do those experiments and then report back to this working group and get feedback on those it's like you know, what things are going well, what things need changes, and then evolve those experiments, over time. The focus here is these experiments are short term things. It's not like a would like to do something"

If you want to do that, then you standard bot process or standard charting, work regroup chartering. This is aiming about how we make the existing protocols work a bit better and tweak them and drive that change in. Some other things we have in here is sort of discussing use case and requirements. So that again is useful. And again, that what will feed into other working groups, In terms of protocol work, this working group isn't chart to do any protocol work at this stage. I tried to get it in the charter to allow to do it, but because there's nothing on the charter to say, actual work. I got pushbacks. It's been taken out except for doing yang models. But that is still an open door for this working group in the future if there's some small amount protocol work you needed to do, that could happen here, but anything large would go to a separate working group. Either existing one new working group, what are the comps I've got? So I think it's probably worth saying, what is out of scope of this working group, And so long term research IDs, ideas that goes to NMRG, that's come here. And it's, and it's also not planned that working groups that are existing elsewhere at the closed and have like a tail end of work, the plan is not for those to come here, even if they're never management operated. Or folks that are less against strong deployments, and it's sort of deployment operator issues that are coming I think that that sort of covers everything I have. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is the other thing different with this working group is that it has a set of topics that it's gonna aim on aim to focus on. And at the moment, we have 4 particular topics And that's chosen by the working group with particularly strong operator input into what the particular interesting topics should be, and, with an AD over in terms of helping to choose their topics. So I won't be doing that not for 3 days time, but so I'll fall onto Mahesh, but to try and sort of curate a role, what the list of topics are. At the moment, we've got,"

Anomaly detection incident management, the 2 things have been coming up at the sort of 1 or 2 meetings. So it's coordination in that area. It all happened that I think would be an interesting topic. We've got a digital map, which is about how to do, deploy the existing Yang's apology modules and in the process of trying to deploy those modules, finding what issues arising and ways to fix them some of those base models were, for example, standardized and which is no longer there. So again, this is the home to try and find a place to fix that. And then the last topic we've got currently focused on is update rfc3535bis, which was an IAB, workshop looking at the requirements for network management. So the interesting with that one is it was an IAB document. So we can't directly published a biz to that because we're not the IAB, but I think what the the interesting piece of that area in this working group is to figure out what to do next is do we ask for another IAB program to do the same thing? Do you want to reach out for operators directly from this working group? What is is it we want to say there and what do what do you want to do? And, from the IAB side, where's Hardaker? We discussed this in the on the ABISU meetings. He's got an interest in this. He was involved in that document. 20 years ago. And so, from Navy said he'd be a good contact person to help in that area. I think, But last thing is these topics are not fixed over time. They can change and again, it would be, like, like, Mahesh and the chairs and the working with the societal topics are. But at the moment, just try and focus on a smaller number of topics and making progress with those, and giving a decent amount of time to each top So I think I probably use up enough of your agenda time.

Good afternoon, everybody. So, this work, we started at IPF 105 seen, in, in London and where we kicked off and we had several site meetings, and I've been asked, to, trade an overview document to so that the IDF community better understands how the individual drafts are related. Let me start describing what is actually the that the motivation, the driver behind it. So we have with, with Yang in August 79 50, modeled configuration and operational data from the networks. And have operators which are organizing the data in so called data mesh or in data lakes. And, today, at the network operators, and they have been asking, around the industry quite a few of them. When you're subscribing to new young data in the network, usually takes time until the yang data can be visualize to the, the operational people. And the reason why is because it needs manual post processing. So basically, we can have an automated data processing chain. And therefore, that's, slowing us down. So"

And we need also to bring now this in the, let's say, the operator vendor vendors. So, yes, we want to have an automated data processing pipeline. We want that I FST finding for the operational metrics, the semantics, we wanna generate in the, so called analytical metrics so that we can gain inside, from the operational matrix we have We are, collecting from the network important for us is that the metrics being exposed from the network should have for time stamping. So that means not meant, network event has been exposed but when basically the change in the network has been observed. We wanna make sure that, we know from which network node which process, basically the metrics have been exposed from the network. We don't wanna change that along the data processing pipeline. So already already have that information right at the source where we generate the the network metrics we wanna forward that, the metrics unchanged from the network. Because at the very end, we're gonna use, those metrics not only to generate the analytical metrics, but also we want to close the loop. So whenever there are changes in, the data processing pipeline we no longer be able to, at the end, to close the loop. And also, it will leading to problems, on the data made on side when we do the the integration among different, their toolings, And at the end, controlling of the semantics is important.

From the network node, we are actually, pushing the metrics, we are having subscription, state change notifications, informing the young push receiver that we have a new subscription. And from there, we can discover based on what have been subscribed what are the yang models and what are the related or augmented late young models so that we have, from a semantics point of view, the right the right information. So that further when we are pushing those metrics is toward Apache Kafka, which is a message broker. We can use, the yang modules, the semantics from the network, we have previously registered in the schema, in schema registry. So that we have possibility when we are consuming the metrics from Apacheka that we can validate the message from the network against the Yang's semantics. So that allows us to make sure, that we controlling, not only, data processing pipeline, but also using the the, the semantics, the young modules for creating, at the end, that the table in the times that he's database or in the stream processor to import the data automatically. So with that, basically enable an automated data processing chain. To give, while implementing this chain, we identified some gaps in, in the documents. And I'm going now through 1 to 1.

The young push receiver is able to, to learn these changes. And then we have the supportive hostname and sequencing so that we know exactly from rich network node. This has been pushed from and the sequence number give us an unique, possibility. In the data processing engine change identify each and every single message. And basically, okay, organizing how much delay or loss we have which is important because we are in then, then, then, then, real time data business here. Then in the push update and push change up notifications, same again, adding the whole statement, the sequence, ID, and also the so called observation, time stamping.

So basically, it should help towards the, the root cause analyzes and it should help in describing it, not only to a human, to an operator, but also, when we are changing the data with another system in animal detection, we, differentiate between mainly between 3, 3 different kind of outliers. So with the symptoms, we need to describe what kind of outlier, it is a global outlier.

So how would you evaluate that? Exactly. So the, the architecture for network at, anomaly, each addiction itself. I would say we acquired mature. It's about 1 and we have 1 and a half years of, experience, in production network. While this work, how to do the labeling, and then later also the, the refinement on the life cycle. This is something which we recently been working on, so it's not that mature yet. Okay. And I think the main point here is, Yeah. We want to get feedback from, from other operators and, and start actually to come up with a more general solution for everyone. Very good. Thank you. There are two people in the queue. Vincenzo, Yes. Sorry, guys. Can you can Sure. you hear me okay? Yeah. Yeah. Just wanted to add a small thinking very small to the to the answer that Thomas just provided I'm, I I think this work, especially the the life cycle part, this might be very useful in terms of, active learning, which is a branch of machine learning, which is exploring the ability of combining, the creation of labels both from humans and AI. So that's also something we are currently exploring as part of this experiment.

I don't I don't see even some other sources like a 6 log 6 log on this kind of sources. So talk talking with my colleagues in in some of the operations, they they are doing this correlation the different sources. And then with that, somehow going wants to be on and and detecting impact and doing some forecasting, you know, some prevention predictability of the of the situation. So but my question is is that how far we can go in the direction of integrating other sources for for Do you see any chance? The capital architecture pretty open. So that we can also do other use cases, actually right now, Alex, who I'm saying from the inter university in Lyon, is doing an internship at NII, and he's discovering that basically, that this cannot only applied to legacy VPN services, but also on the, on on the internet, on, on VGPAS, use cases. So and we observe that that architecture is pretty flexible. Okay. Thank you. Justin. Thank you. Thank you, Thomas. Thanks.

So we try and try and make them good dictionary, like, definitions, not, I know there's just some often definitions going wordy things, and they start describing examples before they've even actually defined the term. No dependent terms, critically, you have undefines. We make sure we define stuff properly not not circular, of course, definitions are eventually circular because they have to be defined in terms of other terms, but, we don't need all possible terms, and we don't need very detailed explanations. That's something that comes out of the drafts is that the other drafts as they go and work through the the the actual use of the term. Would help to be consistent with our STOs. We've looked some of the terminology from TM4, and we weren't overly happy with terms that were there when we looked at it from a sort of a pure perspective. So, we might wanna help. And, again, the liaison, I think it's very important there to to help sort of align the terms we we may find when we look at the draft that, taken a particular set of definitions to the terms we may decide to use the words in a non English way in the way we're we're working here so we may say, well, in this work, we mean this.

As we go through that work, we can sharpen the sharp mistakes.

Then the last comment about this is about timing. So sometimes it feels like these terminology dot take a long time to settle, and I don't want the work you'd spend years working on this, and it sort of delays out of work. So in some senses, are getting sort of reasonably good definitions early on quickly. And then also refining the other work and refine the decisions as that work progresses.

You don't know if If it's a right incident or right anomaly not too sure any longer. Right? So and that also clarified that in all discussions, your use different terms. So the terminology is very important. The question by Mahesh, the relationship between, you know, an anomaly and incident So this is why we believe that this is like a package of 3 different drafts. That should be linked together. So what comes to my anomaly with the right term, and detection as well, Marsh, should go to an incident whenever you show for for sure. Well, you know, for sure. We believe that those 3 should be the 3 the author of the 3 draft should be working together. So you you propose a design team. This is a brand new working group. We're not such in a favor of design team because we want to see how the people will self organize in the team, right, in the mailing list.

Did I summarize what we said correctly? Alright. Rub. So that that was sensible to me. So one question I have is we talked about detecting these incidents and, categorizing them, imagine them.

But, the reasons kind of why the models are not we could monot model, domains, as networks you know, the the problem was that you know, the you we couldn't get really the proper topological model because, every application would also and have look into the attributes and to understand the highest apology ISI's apology was not defined through the entities and that ships. It was defined inside the attributes themselves. So, really, the model itself didn't represent the apology. The next experiment we did. We did some augmentation to our CA345 and and"

The limitations, during the experiments and the pox that you did, and and we didn't do just these two IGP protocols. We did more than that, and we then advise let's say, 7 categories of things. The first two bidirectional links and more point connections. And and, sorry, I forgot to mention, we we did kind of submit draft, that digital math draft that, bigbigbig talks more about and describes all of these limitations and gives more information for those who are interested. So the solution for the first two gaps that we identified by directional links and all connectivity links in rfca345 there are some solutions proposed in Nigel's draft and, Currently, it's ops, AWG draft for some refinements, but would be moved to the NMM up. And, Nigel is there in the room. So if anyone has any please ask Nigel. The next three identified during the experiment with, Oscar's draft and, also the the other drafted on those guys, I I say here to be moved to animal, it will probably be submitted, to animal path to this comfort at the meetings.

So I'll just I won't go into the details of kind of that approach if anyone is interested you can look at in the draft. The proposal that we have is to start work on RFC 8345bis. To provide the backward compatible model to support all these limitations. And for first two, because Nigel draft already covers, the proposal, even 2 options we proposed to start from the basic back with a compatible approach from, from that draft. And then also to evaluate all the other implementation inside current augmentations for simplicity. And if generic, to use them, 3 domestic candidates for for, RFC A345bis. For 3, 6, and 7, meaning links between network missing supporting relationships and some topologies semantics. RFC 8795, has some approaches model, so we should consider that the approach for consideration. And, for the option 5 notes, TPs, links, and for the gap 5 notes, DPs links in multiple networks with believe it it needs some further analysis. As it it it has bigger impact on the topology, treat another enhancements but the core here is really that all enhancements will consider both current usage and we'll be back with compatible.

So you know, potentially, we have to go through augmentations of augmentations to be sure that we are capturing everything, but we started this analysis and and the first thing we did is we said, let's let's try to do some categorization. First of whether those jobs are, like, what functionality are they apological update, the PM inventory, are they generic or specific technology? And then the important thing is what are they? What's the purpose of augmentation? Really? Is it to add new attributes? Is it to add new events, new relations, And then with question marks, topological entities, if the there is a addition of the topological entities. In that case, the whole purpose of RFC A345 to be able to explain the court the apology the layered apology, is not fulfilled, really. So in that case, we have to see White was done in the augmentation and to book it, but possibilities to do it maybe through the core or to discuss with the other orders, for the reasons. And also the last one is usage. Some of them are just using the types. So in that case, you know, there is no impact whatsoever for if any changes.

Then, again, we have some underlay relation defined, we have some genetic extensions. For example, cross domain links, the problem that we're talking about different domains and links between Gross domains, they are defined in augmentations. But I needed another augmentations as well potentially. So it the the consequences that multiple augmentations would define it in their own way. And also some roles for topological entities at the different defined in these augmentations and custom made. The consequence for all of this is these augmentations are not consistent, and it will make it very hard to deploy the multilayer digital map So our goal would really be to achieve that all to pledge plan is and deletions for all layers.

Can I reply to you again? Yes, sir. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I agree. 8795 are, please, very complex. However, However, if we start putting all the requirements that you need to address, I don't believe you will end up with anything simpler than 87 5. The problem is the number of the requirements that you are putting together. Of course, if you screen down a subset of the requirements, you can simplify the solution And that's why in case we are working on a profile, you can take a subset of 8795 if you have a a subset of our our requirements for the rest.

So so I can I can maybe leave Oscar to to say something about that? Like, for me, also one thing to think about is backward compatibility. So if you would use 8795 as a core topological model than all the others which augmenting from 8345 would not it wouldn't be backward compatible for all of those. But maybe Oscar, you you want to say something. And, no, just just about the main order the traffic engineering model, that I believe that many of the concepts there I Are or would be applicable as a core model.

I they're having a, like, a large base model or lots of augmentations think having lots of augmentations is quite a good way because you but I think one of the comments made earlier was that these augmentations aren't all working together in that there's inconsistencies between them. So that's something I think that IETF that is the case, we should be trying to resolve that and get to the point that the augmentations can all work together different ways Yeah. Yeah. The the I think just to answer to them, that's why we are doing all this classification to understand what augmentations are for, you know, because some of them are really for linking to, let's say, for inventory, the the inventory apology draft is to link topology with the inventory with the new IV or we have the PM 1, which is adding some statistics and performance management, KPIs and metrics to the to the the apology model, you know, and but others are doing technology specific augmentations. You know? Generic ones is sub, and it is a traffic engineering van. And and there are kind of, some generic funds like VPN PM for VPNs genetic, but it's still at the services layer. So there are a few others maybe which are generic for relationships, but for the core topological one, I think they are the main ones. And one last comment here is this is one of the exact purposes of this working group is we try to deploy this technology and find out what stuff isn't working together and what bits break and those rough corners and see if we smooth out and fix can those things. those I think this is good stuff.

That's that's important. So don't don't don't exclude it a priority. There, there were a lot of non key things that needed to be added, and it was taken the decision or to do it in 87.95 and not to do yet another separate, augmentation So probably some of those things, could be worth, being analyzed there as well. And the second thing, I really like that you stress the simple backward compatible finger. Because, probably, this is more a question for, for for for Nigel. I've seen some augmentation that might or might not be, backward compatible This is this is a a separate discussion, but Please be aware that, 3345 is very widely deployed now. So Please, keep in mind that that the backward compatibility is, is extremely important Sorry. Nigel, you can maybe have a chat in the room afterwards, but I think what Nigel has in his draft is, fully backward compatible. I want to, answer to call or comment on BECO company or 70 I don't think there is any issue because it is 795 is adding an attribute. 28345.

The thing is adding topological entities. You know? So if you have, some layers modeled in the core and some layers modeled in the in the augmentation, but or cross the main new model in augmentation. But single domain in core. And then existing, drafts or RFCs are augmenting the core, but not they are not augmenting the the new the the the the those graphs are not augmented in new topological elements. And if you need to amend a new top priority, I mean, you need to up the to upgrade those stuff. But if you create new topological elements to over 8345, they you have exactly the same issue. You have to augment a new topological element. The problem is that your existing augmentation, which are menting the 80, 45 existing topological elements still works even if you use 87.95 together.

The weakness was There weren't any applications that, for example, did SNMPV3. Everyone was still using the old V2C V1 stuff because it was there. The application supported it. And the same thing I think is now freeing here. I mean, we see, like, like, Thomas doing doing I think some bespoke work around Yang, but what we're really not seeing is a is an ecosystem of here is an app application. Like, we're using libra and MS now in the knock. Here's an application. That can make use of this data in a very practical way make use of of of network instrumentation, telemetry, whatever. In a very practical way that gives you the insight that you can get with traditional, I say a bad word. With classical or older network management application, that already exist. So people go with the default route.

And and I know Benoit, you've been very vocal in the past about getting more Yang module development in a more agile way I think that's fantastic. More of that drum should be beat. To say we need to do a better job at getting standards based modules out there that are augmentable that that come out quickly and encourage vendors to say, well, know we could define our own, but it would why not just augment a little bit little here, a little there, into some that are that are standard space.

They're just doing scripts and screens creepy and CLI stuff because that's what they've always done. They've got the scripts and they're not they sort of weigh outside the scope of that versus some of the operators who come here much bigger operating things who have a lot more flexibility and and ability to actually create solutions and things like that. So I think it's different sets operators that have different views of how relevant this stuff is, and it's how do we work out we care about all of them or the ones that come to IETF and how do we outreach to those Is I be involved in that? Is it just us? Lots of questions here. I'm I'm from Mahesh. In the chest? Yep. So very, very pertinent comments, Rob, think regarding the the scope, by now, this is for a project probably once we keep working on on that probably could be the need of spinning off something to all the document or whatever. Let's see. By now, we we will start It yeah, checking the the the status versus the the previous RFC and try it on could be the conditional directions, and then Then let's decide if this potential duration by the go in different documents or or so I will say that. And regarding the the venues from the operators, and so we yeah, or or ideas to also try doing each other other operators in this kind of venues, a rep, or lucknik, or rapnik,"

It's probably The ones that we are here we don't have all, all divisions. So we need to open up this to to others. Also, I agree. Yeah. So because I think definitely, which sounds a good thing. And I, I mean, I don't generally go to as I went to one of the right ones, and I was really surprised that there was no sort of session at all on network management. I I was just It's like, how's this possible? Don't mean. Is. Okay. Uh-uh Oh, okay. I'm a little bit cut off from current operations. And it looks to me like I'm the only survivor of that work shop who's actually present here. I would like to drop some remarks from that perspective. Quite clearly, you cannot do a business for a workshop. Actually, if you have trouble for getting to, a well cut document, you might actually resort to a workshop and just over minutes of it. Like was done back then. Kind of the situation right now to me looks very, very different from back then. The actual outcome was essentially the, the, the, suggestion of doing Netcon or what turned out into netconf. And all the things that have come later like young were kind of looked as something, as a very futuristic, suggestion"

Was going to teach the net management AD that SNMP was not really sufficient for doing everything. And, kind of one of his suggestions from my experience is Yes. You have to you you have to, really, keep are avoiding a gap between a cloud of people doing network management systems and, operators that actually remote from them and towards Joe's comments, yes, I think, I think, and that's, certainly a problem. That one has to address certain levels of operators who actually needs to have different tools or well, okay. Maybe in in the end, looking into the technical details. It may be the same tools, but it may be different levels of language, and complexity to actually interact with the tools. So, Good luck. And, actually, things look"

I have a clarification question. Is this work only about NetComm and, as was mentioned, the consequence of NetComm, which are ResKump and Yang, or there is more to it. So let's assume that the operators are turning oh, I want to have AI ready networks or LLM's ready network now. Is this in scope of this work? Is this the focus is just yang or or bigger, my personal comment. I I think that the focus is automation. Jan is the tool that we have for automation today, but product could could go maybe some do something else don't know. I don't know. But, is that the focus is automation and paying with the tools that we have, with the experiences that we have. And will that derive maybe needs for for Alright. Because whenever Chin asked the audience for this, I was asking, actually, the reverse quest and which inputs, what are the people for which we need to ask the, the input information and to come back to your point, Rob, I mean, I don't believe that we've got enough operators here to give the requirements from the operators here already. We've got this brand new, and I'm up working group. Right? So believe you need to reach out with an IAB workshop and to arrive and to Nanoch and to see what are the next big thing And I hope it won't take 20 years, but it depends which requirements you want to tackle. Is this young? Only ordered thing after that, Yeah. 2. I I would say that the the point is,"

Yang is really nice, but it is only Something Well, okay. It's not the goal. It's actually, a tool for something better. Take And that will be the conclusion of the survivor of the first workshop. It's, 3 PM, we would like to Thank you all for participating. And let's keep let's start and let's keep working. Thank you. Secure. See if, most of the course of"
