I am Alvaro, and Bruno was one of the other chairs is online. He's, back home in France. I I believe y'all won't be able to make it today. Brilla, do you wanna say hello? Good morning. Everyone says good morning, even though you couldn't hear them or I couldn't hear them, but, you know, okay. So why don't we start with the slides? Let's go to the next one for This is the note. Well, important things about this is not just IPR, but it talks about behavior and how we want respect in the meetings, how we want to treat everyone else as participants. So please, if you haven't read it, actually read it, you can visit the VCPs down at the bottom, next slide. Some general meeting tips. About, your participation, whether you're here in person or are remote. Please make sure if you're here to scan the QR code. That will also let you get in the queue if you want to say something.

The next slide. So we have, the Compressed service, 7 lists and coding document in working group last call. This was initiated back in January. There are according to our notes, the couple of open points, we're gonna have a discussion later today. On that. Where Francois is going to present the status of, of where they are addressing the the especially the bigger issues. The one that is the bigger one is, of course, the the upper layer check some. That has been discussed on the list. So we'll look forward to that discussion. Next slide. We did manage to publish 2 new RRCs, thank you to our AD, Jim. For the a bunch of the heavy lifting. We have 20 ROCs We know that the Wiki, the spring Wiki for, to look at the queue on adoptions and working for less calls. We're working on trying to, move that along. Next slide. We have full agenda as we always do. As you can see, the first couple of topics here have a little bit more time because we expect there to be a little bit more discussion there. We will prioritize those or anything else.

So we did that in in mid January. And that was the last, remaining issue that was struck on on the GitHub. I then we, as Alvaro already mentioned, the the walking group start by the end of January.

I would also add that the prime is not really is not very specific to compressive not even specific to assembly protocol, in fact, that there was an email, I think, from, Brown bundy account. In that thread, I'm saying that he had to to address that very same issue. In the CRH craft in 61. So Now we're we're getting to the, the decision part.

To me, this is an issue for various reasons. I'll be responding to that more on the mailing list But I think my question on this one's more to the chairs, We acknowledge in here that the L4 checks on does have a problem on middle boxes, and that potentially runs into conflict with maybe 200. Therefore, I would ask that at minimum, This is last called and made aware of in 6 man We're 6 man as the holders of 82100, and I'd like to know from the chairs if they do plan to do that. And potentially either update 8200, though I don't know that that would be an acceptable solution, or we've got 8200 to fix this. I'm just gonna continue with the queue, but, I'm I know for a fact that, of course, 6 minutes is aware of this. There's a lot of cross pollination of participants, and I know chairs are are also aware of these issues. My personal opinion is that we don't need to update 82100. We need to make indicating the draft and make you know, put awareness on the fact that there are issues. With middle boxes. And then let whoever's going to deploy this, make their their decisions. Suresh, you're next. Thanks, Alvaro. So I I kind of agree partly with Andrew, but, like, mostly with you. Right? Like, I don't think it requires a 200 update.

In fact, it's missing some important ones, and have some that were discounted because they're not not useful. So that last bullet point's gonna be particularly interesting.

It defines a new segment called, MicroTAP segment. Which is used for capturing traffic of interest.

So in this example, we have a small service provider network, comprising of router a, router b, CND, which are running SRMPLS.

So, we would like to capture, the traffic at router b, for pack analysis. Let's assume. Right? So on a router a, micro tab set is placed after router b's note set in the set list. Also, router a classifies the traffic of interest with 5 tuples or any other method and pushes that seed list the packets, when microtap said becomes active, which would be on routerb, it basically replicates the packet and and send the copy to, remote monitor.

So each node that supports MicroTAP function, it will advertise its capability to other nodes in the work and also PCE, for SR MPLS, this draft defines a new flag key in the flag field of a prefix or adjacencies to TLV or sub TLV. For the relevant protocols, which basically indicates that a micro tab SID can follow the the given SID in the set list of a packet. Similarly, for SR V Six, MicroTAP, node uses, a new flag key in the flags field of capabilities of TLV, to indicate that a microcap set is allowed to follow, the prefix or urgency set in in in the packet. The second thing we need is that e each node that connects to a monitoring tool, advertises the the microtab set to other nodes in the network and for SRMPLS. This, draft defines a new"

So so we are not reinventing the wheel here. In fact, we are using the knobs that we, have our, at our disposal next slide, please. So, this technique of, capturing, the traffic from a transit router, provides a number of benefits compared to the existing methods, like remote metering. With remote metering, we would cap your traffic, based upon the incoming port or our Sid, which captures a a large volume of traffic. Right? So you would use a lot of rep resources on your transit router, and not just that you will also have to back call that large volume of traffic to your tool form would consume a lot of bandwidth in the network. And moreover, you would need a packet broker, which would filter the traffic and, and send only the traffic off in trust. To the to the monitoring tools, with MicroTAP, You can be very granular and only capture the traffic pick up and trust on your peer orders. So there is a bandwidth saving no need for packet brokers, no excessive use of packer application or sources, which are also used for"

Microtaps segment uses segment routing, a standard technology to tunnel that replicated traffic to the monitoring form, whereas in a remote span or mirroring, different vendors use, different tunnel technologies and the implementation which sometimes cause, or usually cause interoperability issues. Another advantage or another benefit is that, MicroTAP segment, does only require any configuration on your transit router. Which basically adheres to the idea of keeping, the LSR low touch due to its blast radius. Right? And last but not least, this, new technique is less source intensive. What that mean is that, you know, your transit routers they do not need to look deep into the packet to be able to figure out whether needs to replicate it or not. Next slide, please. So what are the next steps? So we would like to complete the draft there are some missing sections, a security section, and other missing details.

We're using, remote mirroring or port port mirroring. Today, but, you know, the problem with that method is, you know, you end up capturing a lot of traffic. Right?

Notably, we're looking for strict bandwidth commitment per path, meaning we to have bandwidth are reserved on both primary and backup. And the traffic is not allowed to go on any day for reservation is not made. We also need to have persistence at deterministic and to to path that we'll honor at all time the SLA constraints and delay as prescribed by the user, we need also to have end to end protection scheme and restoration mechanism, notably sub-fifty millisecond protection switchover, as well as some monitoring and maintaining of a path, integrity, and trend. There is currently an IETF working group that addresses this use case However, the solution does prescribe that the seed list for such our policy would need to encode every single hopping path using only persistence adjacency sets. This may lead to a large segment stack, that may be feasible for low end devices, which we may find in the access network due to limited MSD. Now we can obviously u use binding set as work around. However, that also brings an operation caused to the table and some troubleshooting complexity. So our enhancement proposal is to remove the need of fully encoding every single hop in a seedless and allow a seedless optimization. Basically allow usage of node set or in general non contiguous sets in structure as per the traditional s r architecture. And then the problem we would need to deal with is how to prevent traffic from going into an intended path and their topology changes. Okay. Next slide, please. Yeah. So one of the issues of using a compacted or this optimized said list is a deviation that may occur due to failures."

    "text": "So this is illustrated by this example here. So is a normal case where the PCE will compute a path for a service according to the current network state and available capacity at that time. This party would refer to them as intended path. It will then encode this intended path a set of instruction into the head end using a seed list that may contain noted or adjacency sets as it sees fit. So during steady state, the expansion such seed list and the intended part are always matching. However, when there is a failure, the expectation is that the head end it will switch back to the secondary candidate path However, that would be only momentarily because once I should pay conversions, And now each node in the path will regain shorter passed to to its next available note said, the candidate part 1 will become available again and valid for selection. And the head end will switch back to the CP 1. Now we get traffic clowing on candidate path 1, which is a post conversions path which is not matching our intended path, and this path may actually be not honoring our SMA or going on to link that are where we have not made bandwidth reservations. Next slide, please. So in order to deal with this problem, we have introduced a new flag at the candidate path level that we call eligibility. The role of this flag is to control the candidate past elections. So when ineligible, the candidate parts will not be considered for a start policy candidate pass selection. And we rely on the head end router to on failures to mark the us as ineligible, and we only rely on the PCE or the owner of the intent to actually restore it back to eligibility. So we will be running connectivity check validation on all the parts of policies, we can use any protocol at our disposal, like"

And then when the headline detects a failure, It will immediately mark the candidate part as ineligible. For switching to the secondary path. Now even after IGP conversions, because the path is marked as ineligible, it will not switch back to the candidate part, which will remain unavailable for selection. And only when the failure clears and the pence exactly to the intended pathway intended for it, that the path computation engine or the owner of the intent can store the eligibility back of the candidate path 1, and now the head end can switch back to part again. Next slide, please. This deviation, actually, sometimes it's not just due to bad news, like failure times, it's also due to good news like link repairs. So this is illustrated in example. So it's the same example as before. We have the path computation on the same network here. Added, a link between node B and E that at the time computation, it was down. So the PCE would have compute the path, sent to optimize the list as bed, the usual to the head end. However, Now when that link repairs, we can see pension of the 2nd seed element node e from b does not go through an OD anymore. It takes actually that got that new link that's, that's, that was repaired. And now we have the path flowing on that b to e link where we have not made bandwidth reservation and, again, may not be honoring our s l a or delay constraints. Next slide, please. In order to deal with this problem, we are proposing a segmental resolution or a seed compaction logic that is resilient to node and all link repairs. That is the segment list will guarantee that that we come up with will guarantee that it will always expand to the same path"

On a network where the links that are down and not ordered and only links with available capacity and someone are considered in order to come up with the intended path. However, in order to come up with a set list that expresses this path, We run this algorithm on a network view where all the down links and down notes are restored, and then we run our seat calculation. So in this case, for example, in order to to express ABDEZ, with the B2E link in, we noticed that we need to actually insert a explicitly node d is in the set list so that before traffic down to d. So now when the b to e link gets repaired, it's already accounted for from a set list, perspective. Next slide, please. In conclusion, with proposing, PCE and router based solution that removes the need of having a fully specified set list to encode the intended path of a circuit style is our policy. And in order to deal with the VA due to failures. We introduced the concept of eligibility, which becomes an extra condition in declaring a path valid and available for selection. The voucher will be responsible for marking such parts in a jibble on failure detection. So we are guaranteeing the 15 millisecond switchover. And it's only the controller that has the responsibility of risk storing the eligibility back because it is the one that knows about the full intention of the path the intended path. We also propose an algorithm that is pair resilience set list that will deal with deviation that are due to repairs. So, this concept introduced changes in various areas, notably, it's an active candidate pass selection change that takes eligibility into consideration.

And while you're going there, I'm I'm one of the author for a service travel draft And the reason that, unprotected hop by hop agencies. It's for choosing because there is two things to consider. 1 is the bandwidth innovation, at all the time, So if there is a failure, We don't end up over booking, part of the network and congested because this is for very times very sensitive and very sensitive traffic with absolute guarantees. The use case is different. That's why so that's one point. The second point is that in this picture between a and b, you have a link And it is a is a protected agent said then you can have a local FRR. Kick in. So now you have to deal with cases where you get part protection, is faster than look at a for hour or what happens, and then you lose the control. Of of that, So so that's one issue in using the agency. These are 2 issues. Like, like, you you end up using protected agencies, with FRR can kick in and you get into this conditions where bandwidth accounting"

So, yeah, for the TLFA or any FRR in general, so the idea is to either have, TLFA disabled. This is, one of the of the prerequisites, for example, the customer who deployed this solution did. They did not actually want far out in the work or to run the connectivity check validation, for example, BFD at a faster rate. Than the, than the GLFA. But, yes, I agree that with the SGLFA, there is a there is a risk condition where we may not detect failures. But the idea here is that we need to be able to detect failures on the head end before some other forms of repair or IGP conversions occur. So I think those are both are in my opinion, pretty bad because, in one case, you want this network to be multi service. Not only Circa style, specific. So you want agencies you want routing to be using protected agencies in that network for other services. That are not successful. So so assuming that you're gonna disable and make everything unprotected is it. I think it's a very strong of the resolution. So and go ahead. Zafar, this is Himanshu. So There are two points. One is that in order to compress the seed list, the algorithm that we use Make sure that every link that it will transit through through regular SPF, it will it will observe the te desired May that be bandwidth or delay or some that's point 1. The second point about the timers on SBfdN2n. And, in the FRR timer. The the the hop base, the FRR"

In the document, it basically discusses dealing with new links And the assumption is that it's gonna be handled on a maintenance window in coordination with PC. Does this imply that prior to installing a new link, somebody essentially has to go to PC describe where the link is gonna be, what it's gonna be, use characteristics, and then PC will have to preemptively optimize the parts potentially to deal with the fact that this link is gonna come up And then only when that is complete, can somebody actually plug in the wire or turn up the port?

I'm not sure I would classified as a workaround because, to me, it's just another tool in the toolbox. To deal with compression, just as much as the notes it is. Any in any case, And even in the case of dealing with the repair path, that example where you need to handle, you know, better downlink, and we need to preemptively optimize deal with the fact that that link is gonna come up, that would be the same thing as installing a new link. Even in this example, the seedless grew from 3 to 4 sids. So you can still find yourself in a situation where depending on the MSD, you still might not have enough sense even with compression to have to deal with these repair solutions or to deal with new being out of Yes. Point taken. Yeah. And what I said as a workaround, basically, as a, yeah, as a tool in arsenal that, hey, when we get into a big set list, what can we do? I binding set is one of the tools that we can use in order to, the work around the problem of MSD. Right? Okay. well. And, I I was gonna comment on the TILFA part on prefix sids as Since the, stated that the assumption is that's all turned off. I'm not gonna other commenting on that? It's not completely turned off. I said there are 2 solutions. So either some of the customer they chose to actually turn it off, but here, the idea to run the CCV on the SR policy at much lower interval than a TILFA. So, for example, give really the SBFD hardware based SBFT at 3.3 milliseconds. So each window failures before the AleFA can react. Gotcha.

Thanks for presentation. We have, several people in the queue, go ahead. Thanks for the presentation and sharing the updates. The basic, I think, premise still remains that, we need at every hop or on along the path the this large number of seats, 1 per NRP. I think this has been discussed previously, but, I would task, task, whether the authors have considered using an indication in the packet rather than instantiating sets for every NRP in this manner."

I'll, I'll just quickly summarize that there are there are proposals out there. One of them is a working group draft in in 6 months. That talks about conveying an RP in the packet itself that does eliminates the need for having a per NRP state instantiated in the network. Jim. Go ahead. Yeah. Jim Geeshard, future. I'm speaking without my the hat on kind of. I'm a little bit concerned about this document because we already have the resource aware segment document as a working group document. And you made a comment previously that that document doesn't provide any solution, which is actually inaccurate. Because if you read that document, it basically says that you can allocate multiple index SIDS. On the device to indicate which particular slice this belongs to. So there is a solution actually in that document. So I certainly would encourage you to if that conversation hasn't already had and to talk to the authors of the already existing working group document because what I don't want to see and this this is where the AD hat comes back on again is multiple documents being adopted into the working group that are basically trying to do the same thing."

And maybe if we need to move this further, we either combine, merge, select 1, you know, something along the slides. So we need to take the discussion to the list. As we talk about potential adoption and what the paths of that look like. So the guidance that we're getting from Jim is, of course, that the looks better if we have one draft. Then with potentially multiple things in it, then multiple drafts each the finding, one piece of the puzzle. So let's take that to a list. let's move forward. Thank you.

So, Luigi, and so what these, the draft is about, the draft we submitted and we shared on the mailing list is about, the problem of, us verification okay, how to prove that the packet in a certain way goes exactly through at least a set of nodes, which or that we want that target. Traffic goes through because there is a difference between what we want and what actually happens on the data plane. So This is a big issue in the sense that we can have several use cases one of the first document that was, tackling problem is actually, drafting the SFC working group. Was about to exactly proof of sunset, And never ended up, published as an RFC. Okay. Now, we are interested not specifically in SFC, but in in the context of SRV6, to make sure that the traffic that we are setting up, follows exactly the list that we have in the Srh header. Okay?

So, I would really ask Why would not take this approach that's been, discussed and quite advanced. So the discussion that happened in the work been put in, with the, SSS approach, allowed for scale and curities. So a lot of questions. And, I I would really encourage, looking at this, approach and, continue on with it. Thank you. So the reason why is because we we our requirements was were to have something lightweight and and efficient. So as you will see, this solution is simpler in a certain way compared to that proposal. And, Doesn't cover. Everything because, for example, we are not able to identify where something had a So We just, I'd and the egress, we can say, This one suit that I pass. This way, didn't.

And they have not followed this stuff on the list, but I've had a number of conversations with Peter, the specific set of technologies. So I'll be echoing some things that, we've discussed, for the room One of the big things that has come up in part of our conversations is Sure. You can prove with these types of technologies that something has touched an individual node. That's what you can prove with these types of texts. What has been difficult to discover in our discussions is why that's helpful in a lot of circumstances. The the biggest portion of our discussion is, a lot of the places that that that This is, somewhat useful is make cases, you're really trying to say, did some know that you don't want to touch it No. Has that actually been involved in the picture, you can't prove that with these types of technologies. So what's the actual motivation that you know, proving that a specific note has touched a thing, especially when the problem statement as best I understand it doesn't prove that a piece of work has happened. Now as an example in service function chaining. If node 3 and a 5 node chain, doesn't actually do its work, you can't actually prove that. Absolutely right. So thank you for taking the mic. I was planning to conclude this slide stating that what I'm presenting is something specific solution for our specific contents, context the problem is McBeacon.

Just So next in the following minutes left that we'll explain what we do. So it's really, really specific to Saturday 6. What we do is basically we take the Hmac the ingress, we calculate the HMA card as defined in RFC 87 54. And then we use a series of appreciated symmetric key to Recozilient crypties H Mach. Okay? So that it's like an onion. We built, layers of encryption at the ingress. Okay. And then along the path, segment has to take out one layer. So, basically, the encryption is done in a life or policy bay basically the last key to be used for the last layer of encryption, the ingress is actually then used at the first segment to take out. So the crypt one layer. Okay. So the ingress has to share a set of keys with all the segments. But the the segments do not allow them to pass, they just need one key Okay. Except for the egress at the end. Because we have to verify the age mark. Okay? So our ingress is just calculate the HMA encrypt, Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. So as I said, that then along the path, we the encrypt, we don't verify NAA sync Okay? We use the pre shift key in order to deplete. Next.

And then we have the, what is the NCIP the benchmark. So what we negatively and creep. Now, The nice idea is the the thing is that with this set of operation, the end of the, let's say, service external, we are able to say it went through this list of segments. Or not. What we lose with this approach is that we cannot verify the age marker on the each and every segment. Why? Because he's encrypted. And along the path, we don't have all the keys. Okay? Next.

Thanks for our presentation. Nangong from Hawaii Technology. Just one question. Kanza solution, be applied for, preventing managers pass the devaluation. I mean, managers pass the modification. I would reply. It depends. So between the, the, the segments, I mean, if you run this as an overlay, In the middle, you can have Ditol. And you cannot detect them. You just can detect whether the packet went through the set of notes. Not between the notes. Is you cannot detect But can detect anything that goes around the notes. It does not go through those kinds of notes. Okay.
