    "text": "to this tool where you can set up a session a test session for your group the group that you chair directly via directly via the scheduler this doesn't create an interim meeting or anything like that it just schedules the medico session and then you can use that session at whatever time works for you to test out mitiga with for example a or your co-chair or both um so that you can make sure that all the um av setups that people might be using especially if the remote uh work as expected um yeah so that's um that's a really really great feature uh and uh i highly recommend it and it'll be available i think at the end of the day tomorrow there's one more session uh that needs to happen and then the new version of music will be deployed in the schedule scheduler will be available to that so you have a week plus to try that try that out and then in addition to that we will have on-site testing available at the hotel venue the venue hotel and there'll be a room set up just as it will be set up for um the sessions during the during the week that you can go in and test out and get comfortable with that as well if you if you'd like um and there's a link to sign up for a particular slot on the chairs preparation page so if you want to pick a slot to meet your presenters or your co-chair on site or if one of you is on site and the other person is remote you can agree to join the test session uh so it's um it's a nice way to get uh re-familiarized with with the media set up on site um yeah so those are um"

    "text": "to let you can just send a note to support ietf.org and say hey we're going to have a video during this session that we want to make sure to share and uh medical will help work that out because video doesn't do great through screen sharing again it's just not not as as nice and tidy as if it's managed centrally uh there's one more thing i want to share for sure um but uh again i'll pause there and see if there are any questions about that any of that or anything else that i haven't mentioned okay uh great the last thing i wanted to make sure to cover was how to get help if you need help um so if you know you have a question before 114 starts uh the best thing to do is just to send an email to support itf.org and it'll get routed to this to the right folks um it's um yeah so if something you have a question about something at the meeting uh including your particular session at the meeting you can just send the email to support itf.org um if something comes up during the session that you're chairing um the thing to do is to type into the chat um into the meet echo chat um uh a comment or a question that starts with meat echo because medico monitors all the sessions that are going on um but you know they're taking care of a lot of things all at once but they do have a way where if mitiko appears in the chat uh i don't know if sirens or something go off something magic happens and they will take a look and see what they can do to work it out so either support itf.org before your session if something comes"
