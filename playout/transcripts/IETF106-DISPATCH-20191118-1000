    "text": "so cabbage signature draft is probably the most implemented one out there but that also has some pretty severe limitations into in what it can express and what it can do so whether we start there and build on the stuff that depop add I I don\u0027t actually know so that\u0027s that\u0027s the reason that this is at dispatch and at sec dispatch because right now there\u0027s more questions than reasonable directions and i I hope we can move past that let me second your point in general that these groups need to talk to each other mm-hmm including 200 us I know that the cabbage draft the last time I looked at it used the authorization header which wants to use making them mutually incompatible yes so it turns out that at least recent versions of the draft use you\u0027ve got more choices than you know what to do with you can use the auth header you can use the signature header which they invented and also conflicts with the Gaskin response draft so yeah it\u0027s it\u0027s a mess mark Nottingham so just to give some flavor and other discussions motor insect dispatch we\u0027ve had this on kind of the radar in the HTV working group for at least a couple of years we have draft cabbage on our list of documents to watch okay and I think we haven\u0027t moved on it yet because of the issues you you\u0027ve raised of there\u0027s a lot out there it\u0027s not really clear what the right solution is here my heart are hired or bit concerns with moving forward were you know webpack is out there I had a chat with Jeffrey and he confirmed that well that was kind of on their radar earlier it\u0027s definitely off the radar now which is good and they\u0027re even looking at do they need to have a header at all which kind of solves the header name it was always kind of lurking out there because that could be unpleasant 2d conflict and and so I\u0027d encourage you to and I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll talk about this more what day is it it is Monday now SEC dispatches tomorrow afternoon Tuesday I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll talk about it then you know at the least we need to involve the HD implementer community in this absolutely I\u0027ve always personally considered this to be in scope for HTP working group so consider that one of the places you might want to yeah I mean I think that that would be a very fine place for this to end up I personally I don\u0027t care where it lands but yeah III think now is the time for it to land and that\u0027s really I think that\u0027s the interesting information here is is that we\u0027ve been putting it off for so long because getting engagement with the disparate communities has been hard and there\u0027s been a lot of churn yeah and and if we can get some consolidation where we can okay let\u0027s go in this direction and solve this percentage of the use cases it\u0027s it\u0027s maybe it\u0027s worth trying so absolutely and for for context the cabbage draft that several us have referenced goes back to 2013 it\u0027s it\u0027s and it\u0027s been an ID without a working group without any real engagement in the "

    "text": "ITF since that time so great thanks thank you well and we recently have gone through exactly this kind of exercise not for you to be but for co-ed yes I\u0027m familiar with the Oscar work and so co-op has some art some aspects to it that make it a much easier and solvable solutions ways that HP does not share I just want to mention that the the art part of the problem really was understanding well what is a request in the first place mmm-hmm so how much context do you actually have together before you can design that before you okay not Santa Kate it what is the freshness concept you\u0027re using lots of things going on that really application related to the protocol that you\u0027re trying to support right and some of these drafts address that by having that be a specific extension point but not all of them do and that\u0027s one of the things that I think needs to kind of come together because some groups like Cavett rafts for example basically say like you\u0027re doing this all the time and others don\u0027t so yeah John John Bradley yubico I\u0027m perhaps to blame for one of the the options or partially to blame for it the observation is that signing is easy HTTP is hard yeah so my inclination is to actually you know and we keep you know basically for Deepak we stole part of your draft and simplified it down to remove all of the things that were sort of intractable problems with HTTP yeah all the stuff immediately useful yeah yeah and I know I noticed but again it\u0027s not useful if people can\u0027t do it so that\u0027s that\u0027s the problem sort of no I know yeah something that we wind up in is do you add enough features so that it\u0027s useful for the use case but not deployable or do you restrict it to be deployable but not necessarily useful I think we need to work with the HTTP working group would be my point like if we\u0027re gonna actually make real progress that\u0027s probably the right place to do this because the crypto part is the easy part right now you know the how to manage the HTTP yeah and perhaps and deprecating HTTP and doing something sensible might also be a way to approach the problem I want to take that last bit probably off the table for right now and just to be cognizant of time constraints and stuff like that for a bit of context that I breezed through we are specifically looking at detached style signature systems here and not encapsulated signature systems here so we actually want to use HTTP as HTTP without copying all the stuff into some "
