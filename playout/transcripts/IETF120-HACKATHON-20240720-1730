Yeah, so I just yeah, I think everything is fine By the way, I saw that you mentioned that there were some experiments to try and use the Datatracker. Yeah did you end up doing that or will pay them on the You do both. Okay. So, so, so, uh experiment to move to Datatracker So now we offer that as an option people can upload the slides to Datatracker but you're still willing, well, we're still able to accept presentations on GitHub and then move them way. But yeah, the name idea could like to use only data Okay, just people so that I can mention it to you guys back at the knock just to make sure that yeah know. Because I don't know if people like to use only data. Okay, just people so that I can mention it to you guys back at the knock, just to make sure that they know because I don't know if... All right hackathon as well because we definitely do automatically yeah, meeting, okay, yeah, double check"

Thanks a lot So, good morning good morning everyone So can everybody hear me? in the back of the room? Yeah, I have to okay, good morning everyone welcome to the hackathon so this is a brief presentation just to kick off and that everybody finds an interesting problem to work on this weekend So it's the usual things a little bit administrative and then if any have one have quick work on this weekend so it's the usual things a little bit administrative and then if any have one have questions please drop by I'm sitting there at the entry So again, welcome to the IETF hackathon this weekend first things first we all entry so again welcome to the IETF hackathon this weekend first things first we always ask who's for you first for the first time with the first IETF hackathon good to see you welcome very welcome Always good to see new people and new faces excellent so and the first IETF event Sorry, yeah, I really have to bow well I have to eat the microphone Apologies. So who's first IETF also? Okay, good. Also very welcome to the idea IETF Hope you will enjoy the week, the full week and yeah this is a good way to get in"

So this is an excellent start good um oh this is really, I'm short-sighted so far sided so i can't read my slides so in this way um really, I'm short-sighted, so, far-sided, so I can't read my slides, so in this way. So we have Hackathon and so there's also one of the things that is very important to the IETF is running code So we make standards we write standards, RFCs, but it's the most important RFCs are also implemented. So this is the idea of those of the IETF is to work on code and running code and test interpability and so we also want to have not only people writing drafts, but also developers interacting here this is an IETF meeting. So there's the no dwell applies So I ask everyone to be a aware of the note well and read the note well and It's important. There are a number of things how we engage with each sort of respectfully. And also it says about something about intellectual property so it's and so presenting ideas it's become public so if you have to be fair careful if you want to expose IPR you have to be very explicit please read the note well Oh, geez this is sorry apologies well um oh jeez this is sorry apologies uh oh um yeah, the code contribution guidelines be aware that you can work on your own code, your owner of the code but I want to make you aware that to use also appropriate licenses. So think about open source license so everything you put on GitHub it's good to think about what kind of license you want to publish your code. Think about that. If you have any questions"

So please drop by and ask me some questions good the projects yeah you all can have a look at the wiki the hackathon wiki. That's list a number of projects some of them here at the thread table. There's a lot of projects so if someone is looking still for a project drop by with a steward over there he has 10 individual projects I think, in order of 10 with the threads So please drop by here. There's a lot of activity also going on Sorry yeah, I already mentioned that. There's also a link here on the heck hackathon wikipedia lost and found so here you can advertise your skills, another one can look at, oh this person might be a good fit for my project so it's also a way to get connected and another good way is to go to the entrance there's a whiteboard and all the projects are listed with the tables, table number. So you can easily find your the table and the project you might be uh to interact with or talk with. Good Where are we now? This is today saturday this the kickoff so for the rest of the day, it's working on your code talking with colleagues here there will be lunch around 1230 and dinner at 630 and we close around 9 o'clock. The room will be closed at 9 o'clock. So everything is proof for. Good Sunday The room opens at 9.30 you can work through the morning and you're asked to wrap up everything around. Yeah 1.30 and start"

So at 2 o'clock, from 2 to 4 o'clock, you're all invited to give a presentation on your research of the hackathon so this is an experiment. Oh, right, before I go to into detail so I will go into details how to submit your presentation because we're running now an experiment but we also know that some groups use gather uh gather space so if you're interested in using gather space we have about 20 seats I know some groups make use of that If you want to use gather please and we are out of seats please contact me. I will ask for more seats. It's also being announced on the hackathon mailing list. And that is even an email address you can request more seats directly via support at IETF.org Well, you can find your way together or to the hackathon area in gather so it's especially useful for remote teams over to hybrid teams here and remote or person remote. Good um i think we can skip this as it already be arranged for the heck not the results for next for tomorrow so because of the number of projects we always ask people to limit the presentation three minutes And that works most of the time, always actually. So we are very happy with that and it's also very good to think about what do I want to communicate to the group I only have three minutes so this is my goal or my problem statements. This is what she and this is probably further work for the for the future and how it interacts with maybe working group activities. So think about how to effectively communicate your project previously we previously up to today, this week"

We want to integrate the hackathon also with Datatracker, so the presentation become part of the IGF proceedings. I think that's very good. The hackathon has been become an integral part of the IETF. It's also very good. So you register for the IETF already, if you also registered for the IETF hackathon and if all things goes well we will move completely to the Datatracker only alternative next time so in 2100 under 21 IETF good this is a little bit challenging for me and maybe also for you I hope I hope not so how to upload your presentation in Datatracker so go to the agenda to tomorrow entry at 2 o'clock and you can click on meeting materials Is that clear? Yeah, I blow it. So uploads"

And then if you click on the you'll see this pop up and it instead of upload slides I think you see proposed slides but because I'm a Hackerton chair, I see it. I have a different interface so make sure you have the pop-up select the slides tab and then you can propose slides, and we can upload them i will also send a direct link to this upload slides on the Hackathon mailing list and on Zulip and maybe you find other ways to find it more easily. Please share that with me the easier it is to upload slides the better so share your experience with me and i can improve on this I want to skip this right now well the only important thing I want to mention here, that's credits to Charles You introduce related implementation or related material in the Datatracker. So if you have if you're writing a draft and you're still individual draft there's this field related information or related implementation and you can link github you can link at the additional websites, etc. It's very useful to complement your draft with code with other information so if you're individual if it's still an individual draft, you can edit that field as if it has become a working group document, the chair of the working group can edit that link. So you have to request that to your edit, to the working group chair but please make use if you have make any implementation or background information for your draft, use this link it's very useful all right i want to skip this monday there will be the hack demo happy hour you can present your results to the broader IETF community that's not present"

Happy hour good code lounge will be in and it's called a shared workspace in Brighton constable you can use that room to to work on your project for the rest of the week you can register but it's it's for all, of course, but you can register your project on a table. So it becomes visible you're working through the week in the shared workspace so that's also you can find all this information on the hackathon wiki um yeah before i let you go i want to express my well gratitude for our running code sponsors, which is air ericsson thank you and it's uh sorry, this is an old slide apologies here this is Erick and I Ciennick, and ICAN are the code sponsors. So last time it was also meta but I should I should have update this slide so a big thanks to Erickson CNick and ICAN for sponsoring this weekend.
