The at some point we're going discuss the appropriate of the Llc doing a review of a community Pcp that tells the Llc see what to do, but we'll leave that towards the end about things. So next slide, please. So full care is of discussion and to give me chance to use more slides from the standard side. The It hotels a one roof model. The lounge, the terminal room and ad hoc space, internet filtering and then known versus venues versus good venues last one being more a general point of information that some for you to think about, rather I ask any specific question Next slide, please.

And it should not be longer than fifteen minutes because that's generally the basis of a liverpool city beyond fifteen minutes. This is gonna help us with the the the choice of venues basically. It's gonna just make life a little bit easier. Because we at the moment, have a concern that people don't like crossing the road or whatever. You know, we just need to be careful about this close proximity seventy one. Secondly, we have a requirement that we need to have one third of the project attendance have rooms available in the I etf hotels. And we are recommending replacing that with sufficient to make projected demand. There are some cities where we know that Airbnb is prevalent or equivalent of prevalent. We know people make their own things. There are some cities where we know that many more people are gonna wanna stay in the It hotel. And we would simply rather adjust as per the venue rather than know just aim for this this one third at least type thing that. We propose to no longer provide a terminal room. And to direct people to the lounge instead. The terminal room isn't actually a requirement of eight seven one eight it's a requirement of my favorite document the dow the.

I just want a comment on the first bullet. For philosophically I'm with what you want to do In practice, this meeting demonstrates storing nicely the problems with that. If we were in Pacific or North, you Pacific south, sorry, or even the main pacific building I probably would have no issues at all. An additional distance here has closed me some difficulty. That's personal. That's my problem, not the community's problem. But, I note that when it starts ringing as it pounds intermittent. It is actually significantly more problematic putting back and forth between here And continental or any of the other nearby hotels then it is when it's attached or rolling nearby. So I'm not sure how to balance for reasonable but not a little more around a little more flexibility. But think this didn't not even demonstrates that this can be quite problematic.

We moved down the queue. Please remember to say your name before you speak as well. Ian Williams with Aws. Previous slides specifically on the first point as well. I agree with the consideration of having it having, you know, potentially a meeting area and hotel will be close together. I with the verbiage a little bit. Time to lock is not exactly especially of anyone who maybe use in the system device, so I might propose changing the verbiage slightly from time to walk to some other kind of verbiage. Or giving specific considerations for maybe individuals that use an assisted device like, as an example if you've had, you know, hotel and meeting space that were close together, know, walking distance, but you couldn't get there with a wheelchair it might not be conclusion."

I do understand the point and we can see how we can adjust that for. Okay. Thank you thank you. Mark Nottingham. I did think to myself on Monday afternoon. Interesting time for Jada, put this draft up. I I I hear what you're saying about the distance to the venue but it it... It's not... I think saying well, you know, I have to get number umbrella maybe and, you know, it's ten minutes to get to work. It it's not like going to work. It's a very different activity. My experience I think a lot of... People's expensive of Is go a meeting, then I go back to my room to do some work, and then that good on a meeting. And then maybe I go back to recharge especially know introverts need to time away from people. And so a normal Meeting in say normal. It meetings where the the the hotel is c located with the venue. Allows you to fluid do that. It also allows you to have, you know, casual spontaneous meetings in the hotel lobby. There there's a central place to do that. And and this meeting was definitely different in that respect. It's okay. Get up work ten minutes. Go to a meeting. Am I staying here for the day or not? If I go back, when do I have to come back? Oh look at my watch, Oh, I can't make lunch that sort of thing. It it is a qualitative different thing. And and I'm gonna push back on on your your previous response. This is an accessibility issue. It is not... We're not designing cities in this organization. So but we do need to make organization accessible.

You know, looking at our budget. Our network is pretty huge chunk of above the meeting cost.

Yeah. Sure. Hi. This is Pete Res nick. Just on the the close proximity, A couple of questions first. One is The current document simply says close proximity Yes. But does not define what that means. You seem to want up finer definition. I I imagine that nobody would agree that close proximity means ten minutes walk. Certainly from what I've heard so far. So I don't want to find a definition I want to board. I want to Okay. Well, a more specific definition that is by that is broader cholesterol proximity. And and I just looked at it but my brain is that bad. The one roof is currently in the we prefer that, but it's on the requirement close proximity is the requirement move forward. Slack. You.

The... But I think one of the things that you're hearing is that that preference for one roof is a pretty strong preference. And and I I I tend to agree with everybody else. I I have never liked this facility for the reason of having to walk, having to go to north is even worse than it used to be but... It's not a complete show stopper. There are some places where it would be more convenient to have it in a particular city and I'm willing to put up with this arrangement once in a while, but this is not great. But that to me shouldn't be encoded in the policy beyond day. Really, we would for one roof. That would be our recommendation and if we have to do this once in a while, so be it. But I'm worried about five to fifteen minutes simply because it seems overs specify if there were words that would make you feel more comfortable that would give you a little more leeway that... Look that would be preferable. Great. So one thing I do want to just ask about though, challenge on that is whether or not we actually have a a a set of communities here within the, whether we have a call community that stays within the Etf hotel. That work that specs that very close proximity and that we have a distinct separate community that sits further out and is more comfortable with those things.

Now I don't know because I don't have the data about it. But I have a suspicion about that. So just, you know, a question to our. Hi. Bob He. And so I strongly object to changing the close proximity. I think that's is several people who said that's worked out very well. I've always liked it. But I I did always have control. I didn't have to stay in the meeting in the you know, main hotel, I could always say somewhere else, people have that control. So I don't think we should be changing that if we do, we need to provide a lot more information, like I will I was very surprised after I, you know, registered and booked my hotel to discover... It was gonna be a fifteen minute walk. It wasn't on the website. It wasn't well communicated except for there was an email that Alexa sent which I did notice to wait later. So you didn't meet the policy for this meeting and you didn't tell us ahead her time. That you weren't gonna do with. It's very different. And so that I don't understand why that... Why wasn't this communicated a community that you didn't meet the requirement. I might... If I had known, I might have considered booking a different hotel but I didn't know that it was gonna be a ship because the last time we were here, you could go from the intercontinental to the side door and you're in the meeting venue. There were... That was close proximity. That's what I was at expecting when I book the hotel, not not here. I mean did these meeting rooms are very nice. I don't actually... Well they're trying out the van about everything, but there's been there's very little space to sit down and talk to people here except for one room.

I just wanna remind that we are trying to dispatch the work. So whilst we may have a view on many of the aspects being presented here unless it's clarifying question that will help you answer the dispatch question. And we try to not bring it to the mic at this present moment. Okay. Thank you. I I have a a couple of comments. One of them is that things grow out of history and over twenty years ago, we had an Where you had to write the subway get to the hotel. Okay. So I mean we've we've And the community responded with, we wanna be in close proximity. And That doesn't mean no convention centers. But here, for me, this is close proximity even though it's a bit of a walk because I feel very comfortable walking back and forth even when it's dark. In other cities, one block away would not be close proximity because I need to find someone to walk with me because I don't feel comfortable walking after dark. So there's a lot of considerations about what constitutes close proximity that aren't how long the work is? K. Thank you quick. So Yes sorry. There are still three more people in the queue. So what I'm wondering, sorry, I think we started taking for comments prematurely because we haven't done the other slide that is explaining why we want to make this change. And I think perhaps, it'd be better if we actually go you know, on an issue base basis do the slides and then do the questions about specific issue. Is that a okay? I just wanted to answer your question before we lost state. Just a question a little while. You asked about whether there were different communities who close for.

And then then we'll get to back to the questions on this one. Okay, then the others. So next slide. So sorry. So this is the current policy, we discussed Yep. So here are the practical concerns. Sorry yeah forward workplace melting. Thank you. So we are it excludes a number of type of venues, largely is the one roof venues with sufficient meeting space but insufficient rooms. And venues with suitable meeting space a choice of nearby hotels, but no hotel single hotel is enough you know to accommodate us to meet all things. The large room blocks to g. That his booking larger blocks is losing appeal. Hotels are wary of this. They want deposits and guarantees and they we take a significant financial risk and they're not providing us good pricing at all anymore. As you know, the intercontinental here you're not getting at a better price. Than ordinarily. It was their view that be cherry blossom season that they would be overwhelmed with people and I think I made a tactical mistake, but that's this. And then clear... Well, we believe, and I don't know Marxist has has a different view but we talk about this that would need to continue with the Network and I etf hotels, but we've rarely put it into more than one. And We don't really understand what feature of the network is critical call and why we need to do that. So we're proposing more work on that. So next slide, please.

So the lounge that terminal roman ad hoc space. So this is what the current policy is. That we have sufficient space for people to hold ad hoc conversations and group discussions. But at least the one Item hotel facility has space for a lounge and then we have this thing called the terminal room. At the bottom. Next slide, please. So we are proposing no longer having a separate terminal law room, direct people to the allow instead I should say lounge dot code lounge. Folks have low usage and similar usages. Uses that we've dropped the in person help desk technical support is still available. We still have people on site who can provide support and that we don't provide a printer anymore know that has gone largely people have apps on the phones now. And some things that there are related actions that we're going to do anyway that are important to put in have in mind here. But where the opportunity arises us for to provide greater ad hoc space, which generally means us renting the furniture So for example, here if we were were out to, we would have to rent the furniture in. Have somebody set it up out, you know, in the corridors out there, monitor it and then take it down and take it away. But we will look at that.

To think about things which are occasionally necessary you dementia that right to say we don't need printers anymore because the most use boarding. Is that secular away.

Eighty seventeen. But I'm not convinced yet. Okay. Thank you. Next slide, please. So internet filtering. This is the current policy that meeting attendees need unfiltered access the general Internet. And that needs to be in the facility and the hotels including the overflow hotels. That's some particular bit here. Some cases that there is this then the second statement. In some cases local laws may require filtering. We seek to avoid these without reducing the pool of cities this is the as much use, you know, as a ticket clause. Thank you very much.

Child sexual abuse material and they are then redirected off and told no, you're not allowed to go there. I don't know whether or not that excludes that entire country as a result. Okay? So From speaking to one or two people who, you know, have strong views on this, there viewers us no, that's fine that one. But it's you know, it's not very clear in the policy A question that's put to us is does it matter what goes on in the local network if you can legally take and practically bypass all of that through the use of Vpn and other technologies such as Mae and Encrypted Dns. We have historically met venues where unfiltered access was provided to the meeting space and the It hotels but not to overflow hotels. Which is in contradiction of our seven one eight. And it but is that acceptable going forward? And does appear from talking to people as so that would be. That's the question. And then there's much text in the rf about the importance of people being able to work in bars and cafes etcetera yet that's not considered when filtering. Has discussed. So These some problems we have which are directly related, you know, directly problematic. Until which are sort of taking a bit further.

But I wanted to be transparent about this and clear about this because people ask us, for example, Why don't you go back to certain city? And our view as well. It's got too expensive.

Thank you, Mark. Margaret Cohen. I Absolutely don't think we should have a working group. On this topic. I... You know, I love the Etf and I also am painting myself. When I state this we're engineers and we over engineer every freaking big. And we... You know, we do not need to tell professional meeting planners have plan a meeting. We tried to tell them what we wanted in general terms and and we over engineered it. And I think, you know, you should help us step away from that, but then we should not make another working group because all we would do is over engineer it more. Hi, lars I got has somebody with a lot of dots here. I have a question to the community, which if anything here, ends up being eighty sponsored would I be in appropriate eighty sponsor given that I'm also on the Llc c or should I find somebody else on the Isp? I don't need... Answers now just send me email. I just sort of you could shortcut that discussion, I already know what you guys want. Something comes to once that I know what to do. Thank you. Rick sol, I think the key takeaway so far not to sort the chairs rule but three certain is that there are different dispatch for these four questions. And then I don't think we have a really good strong agreement on putting all of them in one area."

And I I want to you know, amplify what Mark said, doing this on admin discussed. And then last call would be fine. I think Richest concern can be addressed by simply walking through the issues on admin discuss, ditching the ones we say no. We're not doing that. Bringing up the ones we think are good. I'm okay with Sean holding the pen, but I'm I'm sure that we can find one or two people to hold the pen. I think it is overall appropriate for the Llc to give feedback to the community about what that document says on on a regular basis. Yes, I agree there's something funky about you holding the pen on an update but giving that input is absolutely essential and should be done on a regular basis. P u volunteering to help hold a pen. Okay. Well if anyone would like to volunteer, Hell known. think just to summarize where we are at this stage, it seems like I'm not seeing a a riot forming for Last being an Ad. That if...

Control help with Direction and again. I'm sorry, K, I must somewhat disagree with your analysis. Please say I do think some of these items may be able to be handled by other means. I some of them probably don't require as much but the contention and community impact of some of these and the need for balancing many interests The only tool we have that is effective is a working group. And in particular using Admin discussed which U j, do your dang best to run fairly is just an awkward place to run a discussion where the Llc is really trying to get not the Llc view, but you're honestly aren't you're trying to get the communities view, so I I fear that we're gonna need Even when we take it apart and get rid of the pieces that don't need detailed handling, we're gonna need a working group which is unfortunate If if I thought we could just resolve it with A d sponsored, I don't care which Ad I'm that's not the big deal. But some of the discussions I've heard in some of the agreements so I've heard about some of these issues. Yeah. We over engineer. I kept disagree with Mark about that but On the other hand, we really need the community to be comfortable with these answers. Because this is really direct effect and our ability to get things done.

So maybe we don't need a strict formal full working group but we need a clear venue and a clear discussion and clear ability to reach resolution on what does the community want? Thank you. But both into it again. So but I think these are not all equivalent in how we handle them. I think the big ones are one and four. Well, one as we several I think you should just delete that one and then it'll make all of this much simpler. But that that clearly, I think needs a very broad community thing. Because the close proximity thing was not something arbitrary or over engineering. It was because of our experience and having a lot of meetings and that was something that made everyone more productive. So it's it's there for a reason. It's not not just to make llc job harder. But I understand why that probably is. Number two and number four... I mean, I'm I not even took me a while the figure forget we had her terminal room and I don't think many people use that now that wireless is so ubiquitous. Whether it's one third or some plus or minus number for number two. I I think that's just communicate what you're doing. I don't think that requires a lot of community So number four, I think has a bunch of stuff inside it. It's not just an issue of filtering. It's whether you have Ip v four and Ip v six service, whether those are available in the meeting"

I I don't know what limited filtering means. But we clearly need v four and b service. If this means we're only doing Ip four, then that's completely not acceptable. So so I think number one a number four require broad community discussion number two and three, I think can be handled differently. Thank you. Hey jason looking good. Just a comment from the standpoint of my personal experience on the Lc board. Think one and two are very closely related in my view, and it would be helpful when ever this work progresses to share the data behind what's driving that? A lot of people may believe if I asked Oh, everybody wants to be in close proximity under a single roof. When you look at the actual data of when you have a hotel that's under that roof. And a variety of other hotels, what we're finding over time I believe and the data will show this and and help is that people are migrating away. From that closest hotel to others that may offer lower cost. Other Airbnb and so on. So you know, I don't know if that's different types of participants over different times, having think different requirements. But would be great to share data when those discussions happen so that folks can see the drivers behind that and the associated costs to some of those things because I think the data always better to inform the discussion. Thanks. Jason just quickly, do you have a view on the dispatch question? Oh. Yeah. Please not a working group. Yeah. I I have mortgage point. I think it's spot on."

I'm puzzled by the the idea we don't need full blown working group and that sort of thing. Working groups give us is somebody dedicate delegated to judging consensus and moderating the discussion and a charter that scope the work. And I think we need that. For this. I don't want to put it on Lars or some other Ad to be responsive for taking all of that stuff. A working group does not have to be a high overhead thing, but it gives a specific parameters in to a discussion. And I think that's important judging from what's been happening today now. So Mark Nottingham. Just to answer Barry. I think the difference is that I feel some people come to a working group with the id idea that they can no, that community consensus to funds reality that they can get whatever they want even if it's a pony. And and there's a reality here, which is, you know, not controlled by the working group. And frankly, there's little expertise as as Margaret was saying. So I I just... I have big doubts about that.

No. Don't know. The chairs were talking. I think. Sorry We were just deep debrief.

No. I asked, would it be useful to get a home to see how the room feels about each of them? Okay. We can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I'm thinking...

That case, I'll I'll have a snooze for twenty minutes while you figure out the questions. Okay. Do it. Okay. So we have started a show of hands. We wanna just really check.

What we were discussing was separating these one two, three, and four we've heard from the community that some of them require more discussions than others. So if there is at least one proposal here, that you think will be fine to discuss on a mailing list. Then we can start from that position and and work out from there. I would just pull as in that last during the queue. I just wanted to point out that the last one is not quite like the other because they're actually the ls it's very uncomfortable making proposal and we would really appreciate if the community got together and told us what you want us to do here. Margaret great you're in the queue. It's quite common for us to pull the community about things is that Last one something that we could start with polling the community about? What, you know, what level what levels would be okay and would not be okay. And then if we, you know, who get a a firestorm and no real consensus. We'll have to figure out where to go from there, but maybe the community what surprise us since actually have some consensus on on this... So I did we did consider that. But I think the problem is that in order to do that, we would have to give specific examples specific examples would be country based we then run the risk of national bias. In the way that those answers are done. So the preference, if we can get hay you know, some form of guidance that have avoids that. Well, I mean, any sort of guidance is gonna have to say something."

Okay? If you say is it okay if The government filters out all sites to consider to have anti country propaganda. I think people would say no. Right? I mean, you know, what levels I don't even have the expertise to know what levels of filtering we're talking about. And I think someone's gonna figure out you what that is and ask us questions about which one would be acceptable because otherwise, the answer you're gonna get is no filtering. And that's not actually... I mean, every network is filtered in some way pretty much. My view would be the any such poll or any such working out will be best done by the community. So last I what will is that also. Let's take a four b six thing out of this right, because we're talking about filtering that is instituted for and and nobody's like, for filtering in big six that the country as far as I know, but letting me through or vice versa. Alright? So I think we can if you can make a statement that assumes that we are gonna try enough six available. I think that would make move it forward. It's really sort of... The the questions you you raised are all valid. Right, But and and pulling the community maybe we'll turn it around as if if people would propose was community members would propose a policy to the community and we see what the reaction is that button move forward. That's write a paragraph of texts. And receive there's some consensus think it would be helpful. And then one of the reasons why the Llc is is registered.

I have to agree with Margaret and disagree with Jay here I think I know that I don't really have a good idea of what sort of filtering we're gonna run into when countries outside of the outside of the hand we're right, right ben. So I I but I think before we can move this forward, I think we need have a better idea of what's what sort of filtering we realistically are likely to run into? Know, Dns filtering ring, Bg p filter. Yep. Okay. So if we... You know, like the British thing. And I would like... Would it'd would be nice if we could do it in ways to blind at the country computer, but I think if we can't we just have I think gonna have to come up with some concrete examples so that people can have say something more sensible than no filtering is bad. Yep. Okay. So in terms of having a dedicated form for discussion, around many of these topics. I'll just stop the final show hands to this area, which is it's heard for the community that there's a need for a separate dedicated space to have these discussion. So the proposal is to create a separate mailing list for this initial discussion in proposals. Possibly with the follow on the end of sharing in a more wider community a discussion but at least initially is the next step. To create a separate mailing list for this discussion and proposals. If you think that is a good idea, yes, we should have a separate mailing list. Then you raise your hand. If you think no, that is a terrible idea. Then you do not raise hand. Yeah.

So to wrap up this and sorry for anyone who's joined the queue we've closed the key in the interest of time. I think the takeaway jay that we've read from the lively chats, the discussion in the room and a few other various things going left and right. That these four points need to be more clearly defined and structured with a range of proposals. Concrete proposed, and we'll create a separate mailing list that initial discussion, and we'll share it on Gender dispatch. So just One thing. I'm gonna take three out of that and just do that as a proposal to community. And so it's one, two and four that will bear with that process with because I heard from a number of people that we just go ahead with three as a proposal. It's no. It's not documented in the same way as the others. Yeah. I think there was some chart on jab about if in it's not used often, some people do like they use super checking that with the community. Yeah. Just a clarification. You know, if that process and and it turns out that, yes, a document update is needed. Is the presumption after this discussion that Ad sponsored is appropriate? Or which is how I read it. Or does that need to come back to Gen dispatch or another No. Menu. Think it's clear, we've heard that the community needs to give enough inputs. On the proposals, so if that can be achieved via mailing lists then that would be one way coming back to Gender dispatch would be another way. So I think it's probably wise to just see how it progresses and perhaps provide an update back agenda dispatch on how it's going in future. Making sure that that's this community either on the mailing list or in a meeting to make sure the community does get sufficient visibility So going forward, we can kind of leave that, maybe just open for the moment.

Leadership in this community is has shown ability to be incredibly resistant to attempts to overly define what they are, how they do their job. There are folks who have been on Ie g's in the past who have had far less than a full time job and done it successfully. That has been their choice and their ability to do that and there have been people who have done it for more than a full time job because of their choice in their way of doing it. I think the appropriate way to handle this is actually more on the education team end of the world. There's a lot of good stuff that could be done to help leadership across the board, do their jobs better and figure out how to do their jobs better."

I think bridged together. They're not brought together in the same space as as well as they could be.

I think the community that I am generally part of is lousy. I the idea of having an I etf working group to discuss this, I think is probably going to lead to bad places. I think what you wanna do is have this be either an ia type group or some other way of connecting with the I etf community that does not involve the community trying to directly communicate with policy and other folks in this space. I think it's perfectly reasonable for the education efforts that are currently going on to train folks in your community to communicate this weird language that technologist use in the standardization community. I think that's helpful and can be useful. But I think the communication in the other direction should probably be mediated in some reasonable way. And I think the I if I think it has done some work in this area, but I don't think it's uniquely suited to it. I think some sort of program or otherwise through the Ia is probably the best way to go. And I I would lean against dispatching the store working group at any cost. Thanks, pete. Really appreciate that... Yeah. Id is definitely somewhere that there's been a lot of discussion about taking some something forward. I think right now, we're really focused on kind the problem statement in gap analysis. And so that, you know, I think that's less of the kind of the actual solution and what we might do"

    "text": "in in practice going on from that. So but but really really useful feedback. Thank you. Yeah. So I think first, I think the fact that you you had quite a long list of, like quasi existing in that space? And I think that none are going well. And so... And so I think like the... Just during impulse first one is probably not like a good plan. So I think the trying to create I it idea this space for the reasons Pete indicated will not go well. You know, I I I also read draft I find the problem statement a little confusing frankly. Suspect a number of problem statements. Some of which, I know this some around visibility some around, I think policymakers perhaps don't wanna influence and, like, what is happening at. Probably some others as well. So suspect that when you broke those out, people hear we sent sympathetic some of them and bus but others. So, you know, I guess I I I would say you know, trying to have, like an It from this from Iv probably not gonna work out super well. I I think what I would suggest is perhaps to sharpen to made today saying make problem small whole time, but make your problems more. Try to solve one of these problems. Frankly, you know, I I think the one I think is perhaps most approachable. Is a lack of policy what's going on. I I think that both people would here being vi of and that we don't know necessarily a good job of. I can imagine how to fix that. I think, you know, one way to try to guys that problem. Not much a gap analysis, so to, like, try to think about a few cases where the policy fault like they didn't get, you know, hoping for and trying to figure out why it haven't. And then we could talk about when mechanism is make that easier. I think the one that I would, like very strongly discourage would be attempting to the problem of policy makers something enough if influence what happens with. I can talk about why efforts in that face have failed before. And I'm happy to do so, but probably not at this moment. I I can take up it's a hard problem. And will not be solved by the kinda mechanism because"

    "text": "Yeah. I think those are really comments. I think the kind of the first point around understanding some of the kind of existing work in this space. I think that's kind of key. And I think that, like, part of what we're trying to do with this is to kind of understand, like, across those pieces kind of as you say, sort of what's working and what could kind of be improved And so I think that that's like part of the rationale for something that's not kind of in each of those spaces. Kind of in just one of them. I think that on kind of breaking out the different aspects of the problem statement I think that's just kind of like, the biggest thing that we kind have as a next step in terms of that flushing hose without potentially putting some examples to that. So I think that that's just what we kind of really keen to get community input on because I think that it's not a kind of one way from kind of So policy oriented into people but this is about kind of, like, the kind of two way how can we help each other I think we're just looking for kind of space for that. But, yeah. Thank you for the comments. Just in the interest time and draining the queue you can respond obviously to points but don't feel like you have to present us. And Steven your next in the cape... I guess I agree with keith and Echo So I won't repeat that. I also don't really agree that a coherent approach is needed, which was on one of the slides. Not clear that policy making is generally that coherent at these from my back guess you guys know borrowed about it. And if we did have a approach, then we we run the danger of having a marketing lobbying also some other non technical kind of groups also one to three part of a coherent approach. So I think that's another reason to be of wary this, I'm definitely not a working group."

    "text": "Hello cooper. Yeah. I agree with the previous speakers. Terms of gap analysis it interesting to me that From my perspective, actually, the core and the strongest engagement that we have historically had from policymakers makers in the is not present in really the document or the the discussion of this, and that's having policy experts and regulators directly engage in the Process. Which you've done very successfully for decades and decades. Throughout all the work on Internet tele left emergency services. Broadband and mapping, call authentication, to someone's done around encryption, like, very direct input and engagement that in some cases, like, fed all of the requirements that we then built a new technology around. So I think we're gonna do gap analysis on this. It really needs to actually reflect that reality. I would also say I'm I'm a person who spent my first seven years here and the Working for a civil society organization and the three years following that engaged in a gigantic geopolitical process to successfully complete the Transition. So I think we have a lot of this engagement in many different ways with Fcc Of com, nt, the European commission, congress, some of us have testified before congress on behalf of the idea. So I think we need to get, like, a much more full view of the reality on the ground. In order to figure out if there's if there's something that needs to be done here. And I bring up all those examples because the other thing to me that's very important to keep in mind is the power of the Model. And I think even in the draft, there's some suggestions that start to hint at trying to change that."

But I think that's like where some of the resistance is is around this notion that you would alter the Etf process in order to accommodate you know, some some special path. And that I think is a is a dangerous construct when we think about the efficacy of the And it's it's uniqueness in the realm of, you know, global And and Internet forums. So I think that's I don't think we need a working group for this in part because I think I you know, suggestions that we changed the It process because of the interactions that do or do not exist or potentially pretty risky. Thank you. So so Sorry. Just it coming quickly. I think I'm sorry to hear that think that we're trying to kind change Process. That's not at all kind of what we're getting out here. We we really are keen on having policy experts work within the And within the structure. That set out and within the processes that have been set out as well. So I don't think we're looking for any kind of fundamental change. In that sense. It's just about how do we bridge those technical and policy discussions and you brought up some really good examples of how that has happened in the past. But I think that we might want to cut talk to use that we can learn from experience there and and see what has worked as as Mark said, I think it's a good... It's a good approach trying to understand what has worked what hasn't worked and where can we kind of do more to kind of to strengthen that. It's not about giving policy. This is not specific policymakers, you know, and in in in to the environment at all. It's about how do we bridge policy discussions, which is"

You've brought up a lot of really good points that we will take away in our next kind of iteration of our gap analysis. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, S. Wes so time up I need to... We need to end the meeting. Thank so just to conclude on that, We've heard the clear no working group, but I think the question was a bit premature, generally, I believe we believe mobile case needed. For any reasonable dispatch question to be asked and I get the impression that the authors agree with that. Thank you very much Stacy. Thank you all. And see you in San francisco. This is the end of the dispatch session."
