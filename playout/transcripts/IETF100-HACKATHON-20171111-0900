    "text": "okay hello hey everyone if I could just kind of get your attention for I don\u0027t know maybe 15 minutes or so we\u0027re gonna kind of officially kick off the hackathon for those of you I mean most of the hard works already happened you guys put your projects up on the wiki and people have found you it looks like most people are at the table and know which project they want to work on after I\u0027m done going through this for those of you who haven\u0027t found a project yet we have time to do that so if you haven\u0027t gotten situated yet don\u0027t worry this this actually really is just the start it\u0027s just a lot of people are eager and they get here early and get going so don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re behind don\u0027t get worried we\u0027ll kick things off now you\u0027ll have a better understanding of how this whole weekend is going to go and and then we\u0027ll get to doing more coding so I\u0027m Charles a Cole I work at Cisco and the dev net team we did the first hackathon about three years ago this is the ninth hackathon happy to have you guys here with us in Singapore and for those of you you probably all know Alyssa I\u0027m gonna bring her over here she\u0027s a IETF chair a big part of us being here a big part of Cisco actually sponsoring this year\u0027s hackathon which is great so that we have space and food and all that so Alyssa hi everyone good morning I\u0027m so good to see everybody here thank you to those who traveled long and short to get here Charles is just telling me that this is the largest fall hackathon that we\u0027ve had thus far so now we break them down into which season it is and so we can meet a milestone every season but in general it\u0027s it\u0027s been really exciting to see the turnout increase meeting over meeting for the hackathon and to see the impact that the work that people do over the weekend is having on the IETF standardization process so thank you to all of you for for you know signing up for two extra days of work and making that happen in general I\u0027m I\u0027m personally interested to understand how we can continue to make improvements if people want more time to hack during the week if there\u0027s other ways other support that you need other ways that we can integrate the work that happens on the weekend into the working group processes better I would love to hear people\u0027s ideas and and feedback so definitely come come chat with me over the weekend or during the week hopefully hopefully most of you are staying for the IETF meeting as well would love to hear from you about how we can how we can do things better as as Charles said Cisco is sponsoring this hackathon this time it\u0027s actually I\u0027m Cisco collaboration which is which is my group in Cisco and there was a little bit of a adventurous process to obtain the prizes for for this it involved a "

    "text": "consensus and running code that\u0027s how we get things done but I think we had seen that maybe there had been a bit of a shift away from the running code this is to try to put more emphasis on the running code and the RFC a list here is just the way you can go and in your drafts and stuff mentioned the running code aspects of what you\u0027ve done with your draft open source it\u0027s it\u0027s best if what you\u0027re doing is open source just makes it a lot easier for us to all share and contribute and see what it is you\u0027re doing if it\u0027s not you know it\u0027s not like you can\u0027t participate in the hackathon but really we\u0027re trying to create open source utilities reference implementations things like that and make it easier for developers to take the standards that we\u0027re developing and actually start start using them because now it\u0027s not just a spec but they actually have code they can start using and build on and by doing that the idea is to speed up and improve the standards process because if we\u0027re actually implementing the things while we\u0027re writing the drafts we find bugs we find things that are missing underspecified that type of thing and we can fix them early in the process rather than arguing about it for for a year or two and then realizing we miss something and and also yeah if we\u0027re producing running code then that just gets it out there in the hands of developers a lot quicker and so I think that\u0027s a great thing but also equally important to all that get to know each other have some fun you know meet people in other working groups meet people who this is their first IETF and people who have if it is your first IETF make sure you talk to some longtime IETF first get involved in different things just just talk to the people around you because take advantage of the fact that there\u0027s so many passionate people here that actually are spending their weekend here writing code as opposed to going out and doing other things so like everything in the ITF we operate under the note well when you went through registration you you you agreed to this but just a reminder that what you do here is under the note well but the one thing I do like to point out is that the note well doesn\u0027t say anything about code and I mentioned before open source many of you will be working on code that\u0027s under some open source license and when you work on that here it that you\u0027re not contributing that code to the IETF it\u0027s actually you\u0027re still working under the license of that code and whatever it is so that\u0027s perfectly fine and just realize that what is an IETF contribution are like any presentations that you do or that type of thing or around the hackathon but the code itself is is governed more by the rules of the open-source project that you\u0027re working on okay so now just so that you have an idea of the agenda I don\u0027t think anything\u0027s changed from what was on the the wiki this is a rundown of what\u0027s happening today we\u0027re at that point now where we\u0027re doing the kickoff and for those of you who haven\u0027t joined a team "
