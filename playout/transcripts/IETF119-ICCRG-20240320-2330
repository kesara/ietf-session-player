Please get closer to the microphone. Maybe we can Is it on? Okay. Hi there. Okay. So Tom and Mueller have expressed some interest in in actually carrying out some of the attentions of this draft, but because it's so old, and Most people have forgotten it existed. So I volunteered to present what it is. So Why does it exist? Because It was there to help fair comparisons between congestion controls. David, can I interrupt you for a second? Can you adjust your microphone a little up? Please We we have time. You don't even need a timer. Yep. Alright. And then make make sure you're speaking into a microphone. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Zappeta? Okay. So it exists because we wanted to have fair comparisons between experimental congesting controls. And this used to be a very, very, very lively meeting.

You have special elastic traffic, that you put in not just single flows, 1000 or sometimes 100 of 1000 of sessions. And you have your congestion control and you get a subset of results. It was done in NS 2, but it was bent and designed so that you could make a test bed that did this as well if you wish. I'm gonna go through quickly, the topologies Hey, if you want to go into the detail, please Read the draft and have a look. In mind. Wish to contribute. So it starts with what most people start with simple bottleneck tests. Okay. They're probably not as simple as the ones you normally start with because although there's Looks like 3 sources and 3 sinks. Is actually bidirectional traffic. A lot of people only deal with one direction, and that bidirectional effects TCP. So it's bidirectional traffic And each of those sources is really just a different delay and capacity away from the central link. Okay. They actually generate if you're doing that data center 1 possibly hundreds of thousands of concurrent TCP sessions. To test with. Okay, in this particular test, all of the TCP traffic. So all of those hundreds of thousands of TCP sessions are running whatever congestion control you're proposing Okay. And it looks at different loads, 60% to 85% and a 110%. Of off the traffic load.

And you measure how long it takes for them to send 1500 bytes. 15,000 bytes. 150,000 bytes and so on until its simulation ends. So you look at for both TCPs and how they do it.

We want elastic traffic. So it's quite easy. TCP run. So we need the TCP to be able to do its thing not send packets at particular times, but start sessions at particular times that have particular characteristics and let them play out according to what's happening in the network.

Don't actually generate this sort of traffic but this is the traffic we need to test with that's why they did it that way. There was a lot of arguments with the original team. And I remember Lachman, wachman told me the arguments. He wanted to have model based because he likes models. About Sully Floyd. Was insistent that it had to be real traffic because that showed up things that you would never see with Moss. In Chihuah. So that's why it is the way it is.

Because you wanna keep the session times you wanna keep sessions intact but I do want to regulate your rights. Or your traffic load. And that is done by regulating the time between when the session start. So you magnify or riches. The session start times, but you don't do anything to what happens within a session itself. Of course, if you have real traffic, then you have problems like you. It captures a huge amount of traffic through the day. But it changes dramatically a bunch of time compared to afternoon and then when everybody nights off work, So you end up with that, which makes it very hard if you're using that traffic to get any summary statistics because the traffic isn't stationary. Say, These traces are then actually divided into bins of about 10 seconds depending on What capacity you're looking at and then shuffled to remove that non stationarity. So it keeps the short times. And what happens inside a session but then shuffles the rest so that get rid of the non stationarity and can have develop ticks CRD or anyone Okay. So that's a special note about that.

Right? And we did several experiments before, which shows that have a significant impact on the performance of the continuous control So do you have any considerations or plans on that Me personally know it. But when we look at the traffic in a new one, we have to update it what's happening in the internet now. Okay. So There is a proportion of inelastic and elastic traffic going out of the internet. And we'd have to Look at that. Yeah. In how we work our traffic. Okay. So that is important that what we do, it's not going to be exactly what happen from the internet?

Right. Maybe a comment is that we can try to, or maybe I can help try to add this kind of evaluation into the draft because it is similar to the owner of application in the necessary, but not exactly the same because that video conference is elastic. It is not inelastic. That's good. Well, that's that's That's very good, and I'm sure that Tom and I will love. To have you work and contribute that And, of course, the other step is that this comes from real traffic. So it has to take the real traffic, measure it then convert it. 2, to the application sort of level. So it plays out buy congestion controllers and perhaps there's other traffic in the background doing that sort of stuff as well. Right. Maybe a follow-up question is, Not only let's say the video conferencing, but also let's say the web traffic or this kind of backup, they all have different patterns. So maybe we can I'll push them into this suit, or is that not a part of this draft? I think that will be for, the discussion group because It has to have It can't be everything. Okay. And the the question that people will be asking is we put this traffic in, how is it going to change it? Is it going to change, dynamics in an important way.

I think Wi Fi is already supported, like 802.11 axis already supported by industry. In some way. So something This does have a WiFi test. like this will fall within the scope of the draft. The, this scenario, But, Yes. The idea is it should be very light for someone so that if they have developed a congestion control that they're testing, they should just be able to bucket it here. Don't have to do any of the other stuff which should just run and give them their results. So ideally just take the actual congestion control. So, you know, not settle the background traffic and all those things are already, like, kind of set up. If I want to run BBR version 3 over or 2.11x, then I need to plug VBR 33 there. Yes, sir.

And honestly, I'm reminded of why we have CCWG is because congestion control has changed and the internet has changed over the last you know, such and such many years. So I see this as a kind of a cost of why we're getting all these additional things brought up now. I would like to do a show of hands. Let me because I'm curious who is interested in doing work in this space and work in this space can mean contributing to this particular implementation testing this particular implementation, or it could mean showing up at the hackathon, for example, in Vancouver, and, you know, talking about different test beds, different testing tools, and, things like this kind of in a test bed and, simulation space, So who is interested in doing work? In this space, and I'm gonna add in ICC or gene. And I would see an an Vancouver pack of funds scenario as sort of ICC or g contest and control testing table, anything So if we can have Just a little gauge.

So this works mainly focusing on the wireless tail latency organization. So as we may all know that for the internet compared for the virus, especially the wifi and cellular, the average latency or the mini latency might be the same, but at the tail end, in the virus network is much worse. Than the cable networks or than the ethernet. Okay. But we are good. The question here is that the wireless network. One thing that happens very frequently is that banished jobs. Let's say here is the incoming flow and flow arrives at the router. And the downlink capacity of the wireless router might be fluctuated by a lot of factors. Maybe the microwave, maybe another user, pitting or interfering in the same channel. And we had a measurement experiment back to about 2 years ago. Showing that for the wireless networks, the battery is fluctuation. Or in another word, we measured a bandwidth in several times loss, and we calculated the ratio in the two families is much more fluctuating than the internet. So you can see here, for the virus network, if you calculate the bandwidth in the slot of 200 milliseconds. It is very likely for you to see the damaged jobs with the ratio of 1 or 6. To even 1 hour 50. But at the same number for wider network is only 1a half And this can actually result in the very severe delay gs. I will show you an example here. So if this one is the abstraction of the end and transport after this control. And the left side is at the center. The right side is the receiver.

When this access point is congested, the queue in the last success point will be formulated. As you can see, there are 3 gray packets in the cube. So how could this signal be known by the sender? Because we know that the access point itself, it is the congestion point. But it can do nothing. We need to rely on the congestion control. To react to the vendor kinetics. Example, reducing the congestion window or reducing the sentence speed. To finally alleviate this congestion in the network. So this information need to be somehow carried back to the reaction point or to the Center Hart. So what are the current practice in the TCP fitness control is that Okay. Let's say, for example, queuing or COVID or whatever delay base or loss niskondrobinism there will be another packet join in the queue. And then suffering a long latency. And this packet cannot directly tell the reaction point as its sender. The matter is congested. Instead, this packet needs to 1st wait in the queue. And then leave the queue to the receiver. And the receiver says like an acknowledgement. And, Wendy, a con a acknowledgement that goes back to this a center finally those that, okay, maybe the delay is going off.

They use the total number of bytes over this length of window. Another video or it. For GCC Labish is the most like the people in WebRDCs, Pinesse's algorithm, they also use a delay.

Does this have any bad side effects of, like, the delay kind of like building up, building up, building up, because all of the middle boxes apply the same algorithm. That's a very good question. So one point is that it will only add up delay when there's a congestion So what I assume here is if there are multiple more than x in the line, right? So if you have multiple bottlenecks in the line, and, heavily, they are declined as a mechanism here. It is possible for delay to add up. But from what I see is that for the core editor. It is would say impossible to buy value others. So in the core data, okay, it's very hard to deploy this mechanism. Right. So So okay. if I understand correctly, this is not actually deployed in, like, users, home routers, or anything? Oh, just in the home routers, we modified it router, and we can get it. But for the core network, or I speak back for network maybe Yeah. Would say very hard to decline this. So what if I have multiple, like, access points at home, like, linked in a row? Doesn't like the congestion that happens at the very end. Like, kind of make the delays add up throughout the routers? If there are multiple participants, what? Delivery add up. But if there's only one congestion, No matter which place it is and how many dollars will deploy this mechanism. There will be only be one day at all. Not only be able to add up at the point congestion. of Okay. Thank you Thank you. Mhmm. Hello. Back again. Sorry. I was just listening to other people's question, and"

    "text": "I I kind of I feel like let's say you delayed the packing number 4, which was in the act. Direction, And, When packing number 9 is acknowledged it will also be delayed Could this be causing, like, the double conjunction events at the center because one you artificially delay and 1, you delay because there was congestion. Right. That's a very good one. So that's why I hope this plot here. So you can see if for the, let's say, packet number K+3 or something, if it is already delayed, that the difference between the current packet delay SDK plus 3 compared to the previous activity, let's say that the K+2 will be almost a 0. That packet will not receive any additional delay. Only apply the difference of the delay. To the nearest option. I I get that, but if let's say that difference is very high, then you could trigger other mechanisms at the center. But you said you only apply a very small amount of the lysic. Artificial. Right. So it's it's hard to say that K plus 2 or K plus 3 will not have more delay than what The orange line is saying. Right. So you could have multiple Yeah. So I think the idea where, Christian said you could flip a bit instead of so instead of adding like, there were Initially, there were proposals to drop packets to indicate condition. That's a very bad idea because you don't wanna drop package. So your idea. So obviously better than dropping them. It's like delaying them. But I still think instead of artificially showing condition, It might be better to flip bits instead of delaying or dropping packets. It could be the ECN, but Maybe you don't flip the ECN bit on the sending path but you could flip the ECN bit on the acknowledgment path."

But as, you know, you you were worried about ECN or being it is getting adopted in many many implementation. So I still think artificially delaying this not, it could have side effects. It's what I think I totally agree with you, Annette. Thank you. Alright. And then we have Jonathan. Hi. Jonathan Van Deakin University. Thank you for the presentation. Very interesting work. I'm just wondering, have you ever tested the queue management scheme using a multi queue, so let's say FQCODO with, there's already an inbuilt prioritization for spouse flows and how does artificially delaying acts or a packet impact the latency estimation algorithm, etcetera. That's a very good question. Not in this paper, but we have follow-up background archives. Testing with different accounts. Ferocuring, and, that way we can also pass a management therapy and so on and so forth. Great. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Right. And it is you're showing that that they are they are trying to solve different issues. So for the different fair queuing and prioritization, they are trying to solve the issue of the flow computation. There are multiple flows competing in the same daughter. Here, we're gonna solve the issue of the loon capacity jocks. Right. So there are you can think is why the layer 2 issue and the other is the layer 3 issue. They are kind of off of them and reach out and, and can, you have a benefit of both by using both super priority and also our mechanism. Yet. Wonderful. Great. Now we'll look into the paper. Thank you very much. These articles are okay. We can just see Thank you. Thank you."

NVIDIA is willing to talk us through these slides, video. I think you should have control of the slides. I actually hope it's working. How to do that? I just left and right button should already be Oh, wait. No. I have to pass your slides. I'm sorry. Didn't realize that. So now I see it. Yeah. Thank you. And I'll just go these slides were prepared by Marcelo, who's the author of are, like, one of the authors have received life back draft. Receive like that is basically, you know, you apply like that in the receive direction because it's possible that the sender or the server is not aware that you your flow is a background flow. So as a client who's receiving this data let's say, a iPhone or an Android phone is receiving this data, it can apply this algorithm. To yields, to competing traffic. So, Sorry. I gave the intro before even moving the slide forward. But that's that's basically the idea, the residents receive direction, the receiver is basically controlling the sender's right to receive window, which you know, like the receiver has full control over received window by advertising received window in the TCP headers.

There is an open source implementation available in the next And is 3, has it 2 since 20 20. What's probably missing from here is, macOS also has receive like that. For TCP So just to just to add on. And then I believe some initial experiments have been reported in this research paper. So, On our request, the author's updated the draft to the more recent version 6 and they have added a security consideration section And there are a new section on very much. 6 environmental considerations that would include Oh, so right. So the ICCG group. So it would be good to know what is the of this job? they planning to run Are experiment or trial, for some time. In the ICCRG as an experimental status, for the draft So this is something they have added in the drafting version 6. Next steps. So the slide is blank. I'm going to zoom. The next steps,"

We are, interested in comments from people who have read the draft. So I haven't read, but, can I make a quick, comment No? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So I'm not hearing anybody with a strong opinion on this draft. Colin, did you want to say something? Yeah. Hi. I can't let me take over my phone. Colin Perkins. I I read this, a while ago because, I mean, it it discussed a few years back. From what I remember, it seemed to be in good shape, and was very much going in the right direction, I I guess it just needs a review to make sure everything is, is tidy and so on. But, yeah, it seems like the sort of thing that group should, assuming the offers are interested in in finishing it off, it seems such in groupship recently you doing. Very good. Thank you, Colin.

No. No. No. I will I will make it connected to us. So, recently introduced interest flooding attack methods where we think that, this method also can be applied to detect, to prevent congestion. In named data networking of things, though it is even interest flooding attack. Method. We haven't, applied. We published old paper, as an interest attack method, but we think that it will also, give some benefit in congestion control. Okay.
