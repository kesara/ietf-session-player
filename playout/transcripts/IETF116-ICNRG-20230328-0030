Talk loud so maybe you could even hear me. So many of the scenarios that we use this two way request response. Very simple. Machinery work great, but there are a lot of scenarios that we know for many years of trying to build distributed systems the two way handshakes don't don't cut it. You need multi way handshakes. So this is true for rest communication on the web. It's true for Rpc and other forms of remote method indication It's true for kind of phone home situations where you need to pro provoke a response from somebody, but that is intended... Essentially to get you to do something. And pure state synchronization is by definition can't be done with fewer than three handshakes and in some case five. So we thought what would one do in a clean way to extend the two way handshakes that are popular in the existing Ic protocols without upsetting the Whole apple cart. So the features we really wanted to be able to do is take a based architecture like our existing Ic protocols and Make them really convenient for pushing data.

We utilize the forward state that's established on the forward path when you send an interest message toward a producer. And... While those bread breadcrumbs to be used to return a request back to the originating consumer. So we have a forward mechanism for rooting things back to the consumer from the producer and a way to couple the state of the original interest rate exchange, to what we're calling the reflex exchange, which is the one provoked back from the consumer to the producer with this protocol.

So here the know the changes are not microscopic but just in general. We had a fairly substantial terminology problem that caused new readers and even repeat readers to sort like get their heads. Wrapped around the axle to two things that we're very similar but not exactly the same and didn't have exactly all the right wording. So we fixed the confusion about the way things are named, what we call reflex of names. And fields in packets that refer to those names and added at the beginning of the formal specification a terminology section that actually defines these things rigorously. We had some labeling problems and some real confusion in the protocol ladder diagram we had to sort of visualize the protocol exchanges and we fixed all that up. And I got some very nice early feedback from. It's really nice that they start looking at things so early. Which pointed out that we said we wanted to register things in a registry that actually didn't think existed because we had named the registry. So that's all been fixed. And then there's a bunch of small editing changes for clarity. Next slide. So next steps. We have gotten some significant interest from an Ict in pan to actually build an implementation of this based on their c four Cc x, implementation. It would be very nice if we could get somebody in the Nda community do a implementation for Indiana as well.

Stop mainly where we want along the way. I'd like to have discussion about it. So the context of of where I'm coming from on this is some other people in the rooms us and will and others and I have been working on a three d holographic collaboration system and it's called webex I'm not really talking about the product, but I'm gonna talk about some of the requirements, things came out of it. And it allows you to and and there's other people working on systems like this. It allows you to use an array of cameras and capture a light field of of a person who's presenting and perhaps some object that they're showing. And then for somebody on the far side to see that a live real time photo rendering of at the hall... You know if they're wearing a headset of a hologram sitting in front of them with that person presenting the three d object.

    "text": "So next slide. This is driven to a bunch of different techniques. Thank you very much. Awesome. Even better. K. I'll see if I can figure out how to use it. So this is really driven a bunch sort of variations of the media types. So part of what we're seeing is not just the traditional audio and video sent over the Internet. But we're also seeing a lot more of people trying to send textured Map Poly. This is often been where these system started. It's it's widely used in the games as people there's lots of infrastructure to understand and deal with these. It has a lot of noise problems when you capture in real time it often. And has bad a lot of artifacts. So a lot of people move away from these techniques, but they're still used for some of the objects some of the time. And then the the next approach that we see a lot of is these point clouds there's media that instead of looking like a bunch of Oli gone and texture maps we're seeing much more of a large collection of points that each have a a color associated with them. And when you render them at a dense high enough density, you get the the effect of a visual archive. So this is a point cloud capture of that the shoe. And it you know, it it... It's it's better at representing fine detail lines there's less successful to noise is one of the primary driving factors people use them. But there's couple different ones there. Our system we're using light fields where we're trying to... The light field is an idea of having an understanding of what the color of or an approximation of what the color of light going through every point in this room is from every different angle. And then from that field, you can render any viewpoint you want. And you know, there's there there's there's a lot of growing techniques move all these long, but they all have sort of different merrick media characteristics of what you want do and what you bring into these systems and and different object sizes different ways dependencies work between of those things that makes them sort of fit better into this named data networking model in some ways than just"

    "text": "streamed data traditionally did because they don't necessarily divide up into stream in the order you deliver them in and how you deliver them. So there's also just things that is you know, like, a lot of these systems allow you to use your hands to grab something and manipulate things or you can grab things with a pointer and move them around. It's it's there's you're making three d interactions. In a way that was much more solid real than the traditional two d collaboration conferencing systems. And so this just things like, you know, how to encode all the joints in your hand render a hand on the far side and be able to use that to detect the graph. Like, that type of data is flowing around systems law. So that's the type of data that we're sort of seeing of these media objects. And there's a there's a fair you, this a lot of large company working on various forms of doing this. There's a lot of academic research onto this area. I mean, a huge amount of interest in sort of trying to figure out all these techniques how they fit together and what advantages are. So shift to talking a little bit about latency and some of those things So the system that we're running today is very much just we have an array of cameras at one end, the capture our light field that's on one the side one. We're feeding this up to, you know, classic cloud, Aws in this case. We're doing a bunch of processing of the light field. About thirty megabit second up up stream. And then we're feeding the data down to each individual headset, that's partially, you know, just it's the it's not the full light field. About six megabits per second, and it's a reduced set of information that allows the headset have enough information to be able to really rapidly render a new scene. So when you spin your head like this, there's not enough time to go back up to the cloud and get information come back down and like, you have to be able to do local small moves of headset. But the cloud is aware of where the headset generally is and as it's moving, and it's sending the information that would need you know, if if I move three feet to the right, I I I can't render that view without getting that new new information"

So in the round trip times back up to the cloud and down again, I can get all the information to keep the points that I'm likely to be able to move to into in the near future. So this brings up the we've we've had lots of discussions about how do we move things out closer to the edge how do we get that compute that we're currently doing in the cloud and move it down to sort of local compute, and whether that's like a five g type local view model or or some other one doesn't really matter. And I think that a lot of the techniques that we're looking for here is how do you discover that compute? How do you connect up to it? How do you get the information that it's producing? How do you dynamically sort of like allow a service to scale from only having an Aws cloud or two moving into having these types of things. And again, I think the tech weeks that we're talking about here, help with those types of issues. So that's one of the areas I think that this helps with deployment, but we need to bring those actors and the people who can deploy in those places into the conversation. And I hope you guys keep an eye on the queue and tell me if I okay. So another direction that things are going. Is scaling up the size meetings. So today, the major web conferencing the products and then then I sort of work in. You know, support meetings with orders of a hundred hundred people. Right? And, you know, two hundred to five hundred here and who knows, Maybe one of those, you know, maybe last week, one of those announced on the larger number. I don't know. But they're we're that range of zeros. And no one wants to be in that range of zero. People want move to be able to have a company wide meeting with a hundred thousand people on the same meeting. So there's there's a real idea. And these numbers have been creeping up from you, twenty to fifty to a hundred to two hundred over the past seven years. Really, they're they're moving up in the way you might expect. But these systems are looking to have a a very dramatic increase in the amount of scale and and what they can be used for."

So All of these application developers are trying to figure out what are the technologies they could use that could give them this huge increase in scalability? At the same time, there's there's, you know, there there's there's huge amounts of live streaming today. I mean, when we look Twitch Youtube, but all all of these types of things. There's there's a very dramatic amount of that being used it's obviously hard to get revenue estimates in this type of area they're really concrete. But, you know, for a while, it was very... When would be which was acquired that were publishing revenue data and the out of type of stuff they're doing. And you know, we're talking about billions of dollars here on all of these. It's so it's it's not small that way. It's not small from the sort of a amount of traffic on the Internet. And I think that that's that that again is the changing desires of these types of applications are one of the things that can help type of technology deploy. So the point I wanna make about this slide, is that with live streaming, things like h dash solve a problem where... Where where you're willing to accept a latency. Let let me say in the fifteen second zone, we can... We can argue what that latency is. Maybe it's five seconds or whatever, but sort of in the the longer zone. But if you can move that down a lot, you could have a more interactive experience with the audience that you're streaming to. And the applications that have chosen to have that type of high interactivity with the people they're streaming So somebody can comment on the stream and too. on the stream and a pretty real time sense. I'm not calling on the stream on it, what it was fifteen seconds ago. Those types of applications are are doing quite well in the market. And I think that the people are seeing a shift of wanting to move that direction a little bit more. So The live streaming people are looking to trying to reduce stuff. And look these slides were originally done for the mock working group, really, this is part of the, you know,"

    "startTime": "00:32:02",
    "text": "argument there, but I think that the types of techniques here can help with that a lot. So the live streaming wants the lower their latency. The real time collaboration people have fairly decent latency. Increase their scalability. And that again, came to, I think the techniques here can be a a big portion of that and some of the stuff we're doing in Mock sort of fits into that. So that's sort some things that I think are changing on the desire of what people are building on the Internet that makes it easier to be we have a good solution to that type of space, get it more broadly deployed. So this brings us down to what do we need to meet those needs? And you know, And you talk to different people about this see this name data networking problem and I seen problem all these things. You can see it as an overlay cast from, you can see it there's a pub sub problem, which is the metaphor we've used for developers. You can see it as a message bus problem. The reason we chose Pub solved as a way of talking about this was that we're trying to convince application developers to move to this and understand how what it would like to use and make it easy from their point of view. So that's that's sort of why we chose that terminology a little bit. But I think these things are largely very similar when you get right down to them. So The quicker is it's it's it's an early stage, some some code that we're playing around with. I wouldn't say it was anything you know, you know, every six months is it's different. And it it certainly was in a very early highly motivated by Cisco, but also just trying to figure out what we need to do to to simplify and make it easy play with the assumption that over time, it would be as we had a better understanding of what it was and what we needed. It would be replaced with more complicated things more aligned with the type of work being done in here. So we we have name data. I'll talk a little bit about the names and second. We we think of it as you know, publishing data with a given name and we think of it as subscribing to"

    "text": "partially wild card groups of names. So let me dig into a little bit more detail about what this is. The data objects have a global unique name. And we moved away from using the hash of the data to write the name and that's partially because these wild features we wanna do later. And also that we just didn't find that that's, you know, this idea of sort of self authenticating data it didn't turn out to be an amazingly useful property for us. We still need to have a proper encryption authentication sort of technique on top of it anyway. So so we moved away from that. Each object has time to live and some sort of priority that helps us in describing how to distribute them particularly with congestion control. And also that, you know, the obviously data never changes. Although that's that that was one of the things that we were sort of experimenting with this is is possible to get application developers to get their heads around writing applications where once they publish one of these objects, some data in it, they can never change that data again. They've got to create a new name and a new object or let that object expiring. One of the other experiments we're doing was like, well, how big do these names need to be? And you could do variable size or whatever all things. But what we wanna do is like If we make a constraint, that really makes it easier to do high performance implementations on some of the the the relays and routing notes, I'm gonna talk about a bit. And so our experiment was really, can we do it with only a hundred and twenty eight we take most of the applications that we care about and map them into a naming scheme that fits in that space. And I'm so far that the answer to that has been yes. That's it's been a, you know, a huge key part of it. First twenty four bit sort of, you know allocate allocated the organization, so we can get these global unique and then you know, you have the nine six bits inside of there.

And This is a little bit off of some of the traditional sort of approaches to this. But it's been talked about various ways of getting some type of functionality like this. And it makes it much easier for the app location developers to get their heads around then the idea that they're going to send an interest packet every single thing they want. Now the underlying scheme might result in the same thing in the end. I don't really care. But from a model of getting application developers to think about this was a much easier one to get them to think about. Right now we're transferring all our data over quick. Partially this... It's... Partially this is driven by the the fact that many enterprise firewall vendors are enterprise firewall deployments we go to tell us that Udp is bad and quick is good. And that's the type of logic that's really hard to argue with. So we're just going with quick. I don't know what else. I could see call to the back of the room like anyway. So we do like... I think one of the important things to us is the ability to actually lose packets, but that makes it easier to do these high latency things is that things can be lost at times. And data objects ended encrypted. You know, we assume that there's a king scheme that can can deal with that out of band. So that allows us the relays only have access to a limited of metadata, mostly the name and deciding how to forward this. And the times to live and the thanks. ...No questions so far. Stop me here you got questions on this. Okay. So the clients we call our... The, you know, the overlay router nodes or whatever this data, we're we're calling them relays, whatever.

I wanna talk about the incentives for deployment of these and who are who are the parties that we need these to deploy to make this work? So there's a couple of different areas that we've been looking at in this. One is just putting them in Wifi access points. And that's a pretty easy place to get in. You're not talking about super high performance type of environment. They're already ax points are already doing that sort of level of processing and having a lot of coverage for that type of stuff. It's probably a small amount of code to put into those types of environments. And it allows you to get a some distribution out near the very edge of the network. And whether Wasn't was in an Ap or just was on on some other on premise device. That allows you a bunch of scalability. It also allows you to sort of recover separately from the latency and time that's happening over the Wifi Network and the type of errors you see there from the type of errors that see across the wan. And and are experimenting with this. So we we we feel that that type of having a a mesh component on those points or near very low latency in the home. Allows you to take a lot of the times where at application like Webex delivers a really crappy audio video experience. And split the types of errors that seen it's separating errors from the Wi Now errors from milan and allowing you to take different strategies dealing with both of those so is a big appeal there to just improve the quality of those types of the end user experiences for gaming, audio video conferencing. The other place I think is obviously really interesting to to deploy these is at you know, effectively the Cdn type locations. And so let me just start at a very vague level with the sort of, you know, Cdn like where Cdn are deployed today, same sort of notes. Most cdn vendors we talk to are interested in"

It's easy for them to think about fit into to their business models business billing models, everything else. So it's it's appealing to that type of group. Think it's also appealing to carriers particularly five g type deployments and things like that, that are looking to expand into that Cdn type market and have low latency see nodes that are very close to the end users. And this gives a way to discover those get on top of those and and and deploy on them. So I think that that's creating an interest in those groups to to to look at what's possible here and and how this work might deploy. So I'm trying to think about this, you know. I I think as as as John Peterson put it, you know, we're trying to put food on everyone's plate, but to get something like this deployed. We need to make sure that this is taking some value to end users improving the application, it's got development application developers that they can cause their applications to scale out and distribute a lot of the complexity of their application out closer to the edge on compute infrastructure they're not necessarily directly running themselves. It's allowing the network provider and the next generation Cd ends to to to offer a service that you know, adds their value and one that the applications that are are would be possibly putting, you know, billions of minutes a day of of audio video traffic onto these types of things.

We're doing an all open source right now. And we we clearly need to write out much better drafts. We're in a very early stage just messing around with this stuff and seeing seeing where it all is. We're driving a lot. I I think this is a little bit different than what we're doing in Mock. Exactly. Mark is trying to is media over quick working group but at It and is trying to solve the narrower version of this problem with very concrete workable out locations, and we're trying to take a lot of these ideas and make sure that Marx aligned with them. But we haven't tried... It's it's not like the milwaukee working group is going to exactly quicker or anything. Or not going to... Gonna do something slightly different on that but it might align well with these types of ideas. So very interested working with people on that. And and, you know, playing where where this goes, and that's that's, you know, roughly the stage at. So with that, that that is everything I wanna tell you about. What questions can I answer about stuff we're seeing? Where we are? What's happening with the meta? I don't know. Ask me. Not blockchain. Great. Thanks, Collin. So you have a couple of questions. Hi. Doug. Colin great great. I like to deploy with aspect of it. And we have something similar in the I'm presenting on friday the routing over service work. And we put a similar use case into this. Particular when you come from where could it be deployed and, you know, who provide the overlay. There's a lot of similarity with the think that we have in the rosa overlays and deploying those very far to the edge could be entirely played in in homes only the Cdn."

Why do I have go to a centralized infrastructure in order to distribute education material among thirty pupils coupons in a small area. I think a lot of similar thinking that would be really nice to sync even though they are maybe differences in technical approaches, but that drive towards decent decentralized and clearing the the functionality, I think is is very common there. We stayed particularly away from thinking of to put this into the underlying. Right? So so the one I thinking is is is is key to that and that's not similarity despite the technical difference on how it's done. Will be great chat about on how these things you my might may up. You also talk to seeing provider excuse me. So send providers carriers, but I said, maybe maybe that's type of distributed failure community could be an interesting one to get into this. I the meta goes into that, but I I I find the Failure much more interesting. So the fact that you just set up a server at home as it works in mustard at the moment.

You're you're you're very right. I I I definitely didn't couple those together. So let let me try and do a slightly better job of that. So It is the the type of Ar vr system that that we're talking about here of this you know, multi user airbrush system. You definitely probably could do that over a traditional Rt streaming type approach. No question about it. Well we start talking about multiple users in it with multiple different types of data that they're they're putting into it and the bandwidth are all going up and the late are going down. And that's really pushing the limits of what's easy to do over Rt. So I think that the techniques that that having a a pubs sub type approach. Makes it easier to do things like have multiple people contributing data that is that is in that needs to be rendered in the same vr room for lack a better space. It's same spatial v and there's multiple contributors putting data into it. That this might give you a better way of allowing that data to be distributed through the network quickly without streaming it all to one centralized server and then back down to the individuals Doctor Ivan. Maybe I just keep I I have control of the slides here. Let me go back to a slide here. That should set a little bit more on. So"

So some endpoints that have a higher bandwidth might be able to get all the points in the point cloud. Where some of the endpoints that have a less bandwidth might have to only take you know, some statistical sampling of the the cloud. This slides looking for here too. We also have the issue of people who are top close, like in this case, Alice is publishing some data, but r one and r two can get a copy of that data, quickly from the local relay and they might have had higher bandwidth it. The data that's getting sent farther all the way over to relay So r three r four might get a slightly reduced side of the data because of what can be sent. Now you could do all of this. With. But I think it's easier to figure out when you have priorities for the data and naming of the data such that the all the people who are contributing data into the three d space I'm interested in I can subscribe to that three d space and get all of that data and I can prioritize it easily in a way where I can say what I want. It becomes much easier to build these systems with this pubs sub model. Not not impossible to do them the other way, but that's that's the area where we see these really tying together as because we had a bunch of people sending data of different types that got filtered from a priority point of view a different ways. It became really hard to do with a traditional system. I hope I is slightly more convincing. I can see from your face you're not a hundred percent convinced. But also know, it's kinda with you.

We we aggregate them up to sort of higher level relay. The higher level relays will full mesh connect between for the subscriptions between between everyone. So we'd have, like, you know, by higher level at at that level. I mean, you know, we certainly different continents, probably different countries would be higher level relays. And then inside of that, we have the you know, sort of relays the lots of local Every everywhere we would wanna have a pop that was really close to users a presence close to the users have lots of relays that would sort of connect to to the the the big distribution relays and also connect to each other just based on sort of the subscriptions they were getting in dating the routes from that. So it's it's a little bit motivated, I think that out of some of the thinking that came out how Webex distributed Rt media in general, which follows something like models along those lines a little bit. But it's it's not It's not particularly interesting. I think that there's tons of good research that could be done in that space. We had a a good platform to to work on that. Okay. Thank you. I I think I'm next in the queue. Is this one? Yes. So These are four questions which may wind up being all the same questions. So maybe just wait to here all four. Number one is this broker based or direct name based routing Number two, are the names entirely non hop or have you built top levels into the hierarchy of the names. Is the amount of state in the relays order number of subscriptions, number of publications or something else. Okay. As always, great questions from Dave."

    "text": "So is that all the same question it may be? Think it was was it three or well there four, but I think they're all the... Yeah. So We don't embed any top in the names at all and how we're doing it right now that the names would look more like We would fill the bits of the name by, you know, you know, some high level bits are. Like, this is the Webex app, then, you know, this is the conference number one two, three four based on scheduling, and then there's some user in it and then different cameras and media that they contribute. No technology information or any information that's useful for routing in the names whatsoever. Different applications could do different things, but that's how we're doing it. And and the relays don't have. Don't look... When they decide how to forward or or subscribe anything. They're not looking at the bits of the name it's a top apology information out of the And the lanes are keeping state that order are the number of subscriptions they have. I guess... Yeah. The order of number subscription they have plus whatever routing information they'd made about connecting to other relays. But the bulk of the state and it relays is just simply the list of subscriptions. When they've got an incoming packet trying to decide if it goes out to one of the existing subscriptions or not. You better have pretty damn good authorization systems so you can avoid civil attacks against subscriptions. Yes. So the so the the the thinking model around that is largely I would say, you know, sort of taking how we we deal with cdn today to a certain degree. And thinking about that. That is that the application that was using this would have gotten authorization tokens? Pass those out of bounds the applications. The authorization tokens are handed along with subscriptions. And also we have a parallel to a subscription which is a as a published intent, which is effectively a request to publish inside a given name space. And both of those, the relays process slowly check the authorization tokens"

Yep. Okay, Greg. One simple question. So you mentioned you're using quick because and you want to be able to to drop packets and so on. So what is the approach to congestion control in the system? So we get one... So let me let me describe because it sort two different... First of all, let me say, like, this is an area where. I don't know what we have works. Okay. Definitely. So second, what we're doing a couple different the quick layer itself, there's a quick connection on any one of these connections over quick, and we're getting whatever congestion control quick provides us there as an upper bound on making sure we don't saturate the link or take something down. But overall, the application has to be also making sure that it's sort of Yeah. Bit rate allocation overall way that's working it is suitable. So over... So there's the congestion control it's happening in a link layer with the short term, but then there's the bit rate allocation and the rate control of that. And since we're thinking about so much media applications here. You know, we're doing the usual thing of, like, you know, if you're five megabit video stream doesn't work. We move down to a two megabit stream. That that type approach I don't know that that type of model would work outside of media applications. So That's where it is. Okay. Thanks. Hi. Colin Perkins. Think you've identified one of the the key differences with this type of application and the traditional video conferencing applications. Which is that those applications are linear and is very much nonlinear, and sun needs a nonlinear linear name space. So so whether pubs up is the right thing on not. The the difference in naming, I think is critical and explains why Rt doesn't work."

And we haven't written a draft on this, but we we plan to write a draft on this. It's really easy to to for application developers to think about a Url as a name of things. And if you look at most Urls for many of the common media service that I'm talking about not the end one that you might put in the browser, but the names that are actually used for distributing the media inside of a b Webrtc or something else. Right? They often have this incredibly you know, there's there's effectively a couple numeric identifier of, you know, a group and subgroup or whatever in a frame inside of that. So we've been calling those numeric eyes with the idea that and what this draft will be about would be a way to take I a numeric Uri ui is a valid. It's a subset.

It's like well, what will the naming scheme I look like? And we try and drive drive naming scheme and then show the how it maps into a hundred and twenty eight so so conceptually you have richer addresses which are then mapping doubts more efficient forward. It it's a one to one by compression scheme that goes both directions that goes between this hundred and twenty eight bi encoding and a tech string that has logical data in it that makes it easier for a developer to look at and think about it.

So what we have today is The r three r four both subscribed to if they both subscribe to the same rate, the relay will effectively upstream to the towards the origin relay, that one rate. It'll aggregate subscriptions. But the relay will only subscribe two rates that one of its clients subscribe to. So if r three and r four both subscribe to let's say, but we have a a high rate in a low rate of a video stream. If they both subscribe to the high, relay be will only subscribe to that high rate. Later, let's say, our fours having... It's it's farther away from the access point is overall data rates gone down and it describes decides to drop its"

So today relays only subscribe to something that one of the clients below them subscribe to but they will aggregate those subscriptions and in sort of what data they're trying to receive that's that's our current approach. That makes sense? Yep. Yeah. Thank you. Can I jump in here for just second? Are the relays cashing any data? Yes. Alright. So then take me offline. I'll explain how what you just did causes congestion collapse. Oh, damn. Because we've seen it. Okay. With even in classic Cdn, it... Where if you cash in the higher rate somebody trying to cash the lower rate can drive the up link into congestion. Yeah. We can talk I can sort of imagine where is going. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. It doesn't shock me. We've done something like that. Let's just put it that way. There are solutions to this, but it requires the relays to be smart do extra subscriptions ahead of time to see if they fit on the link. Right. Okay. Well, I really appreciate time with everybody.

And then we'll talk about the minimum requirements for using flick and then a few examples and these examples are going to focus on the End use case since there's some interest from the Indian people about trying to use this in the current project. Alright. So flick provides a manifest of hash hash so you can retrieve content objects or data objects using the hash based main. And the the manifest will be split between multiple of its own data objects because, you know, the test is too big. So there's a way to retrieve manifest, and there's a way to retrieve application data. Based on these hash based names. There's a canonical order And if you follow that order, all the bytes will re assemble into the correct"

Some cases you might wanna skip around, you might wanna skip around because you're just interested in, like, getting to a next iframe or you might skip around because it might be faster to retrieve the object in the canonical order even if you're gonna re assemble it that way, and what else is there? So there is an encryption scheme for flick that I'm not gonna talk about and there is this topic. There's this idea of name construct and flick. So a main construct tells the flick processor how to generate an interest name So, you know, what's the prefix? What's the sequence number? What's the hash name. You know, so what's a routing locator So the name construct em embody this idea of how to construct an interest name from a manifest entry. So the simplest flick manifest is an une manifest where it's wrapped in an End end or Cc data object. And the node Tl v is the first Tl v that you would run into from flick and then a hash group is a set of related pointers. So basically, these would all just be like your hundred you your shaw two fifty six hash. That you would use to assemble the name. So in End, they have a content type of ten twenty four that's already reserved. For flick, so that would be the content type in Indiana, the hashtag would be the the End implicit top two fifty six.

You you haven't specified how to struck interest name, So it's it's using the default name construct, which is probably not appropriate for in the end because it it it uses pure hash naming. And you don't have any ways of doing, like segmented names and and so forth. So we'll add a little bit more functionality into this to make it more practical for Indiana. So, you know, End end prefers that every data object have a unique name you know, not including the implicit hash. So they use a the segment number naming. So Flick has a name construct for segmented names, so it uses common prefix, a segment number than the hash and the the issue with using the segment number naming is the manifest processor, the flick processor has to keep increment the segment number and it has to do this using the canonical order because that's how the sequence numbers go. Or the segment numbers. Another thing is if the manifest has one prefix know has its own name and the application data has a different name then you're tracking two seat segment numbers. One segment number for the manifest. Segments and one segment number for the application data. So how this looks is in flick we would define some node data So there's an Nc c diff, a name a name construct definition,"

And then we would define another name construct of N nci id one and this would we would use this for the application data. You know, the the zero and the one for the sub manifest, and the application date that pixel arbitrary. Those could have been any numbers. Name construct definitions are inherited. So you only need to define these once you know, like at the root of your manifest and they'll apply to to to that manifest node and every node under it. In the manifest tree. If there's any questions, like I said, I can't see the the hand raising thing. So just let me know. Okay. So you are allowed to redefine name instructors further down in the manifest tree And there there's some specific use cases about why this is useful. It should not cause much difficulty in the manifest processor because it only affects the current node in those below it and since you can't retrieve the nodes below it, before you retrieve the current note because you don't know the hash is, you know, it it's shouldn't be that big of a deal as long as you able to track a name construct per manifest branch. So using these name construct in a manifest we now have two hash groups. The first hash group is pointing to other manifest So this will use name construct Id zero"

  {
    "startTime": "01:42:02",
    "text": "and the second hash group points to application data, so this uses named construct Id one. So this is telling the flick processor for the first hash group use the first name prefix and the first set of you know, segment I segment numbers. And in the second hash group, use the second name prefix and know, it'll have its own set of segment numbers. So if you want to be able to retrieve data out of order you need a way of including the segment number with the hash pointers. So so it's all explicit. For for the parser. You don't have to accumulate the segment numbers over the order. So The way flick four does this is it has a different entry under a hash group called an annotated pointer. And an annotated pointer allows you to put metadata like the segment Id and annotation Tl So every hash entry has its own sequence number. So you could list them in any order you want because it's all explicit. This gets very verbose because you're adding you know, a Tl v and a segment number for every hash pointer. So As I was putting the slides together, I realized you know, it might be easier if we just say, here's the starting segment number for this hash group. And then, you know, you you you increment it. So we'll we'll probably add this to the draft because it's a it's a much more efficient way of of"

So the these are used you know, in both Indiana and and Cc. And they basically say here is a top name to use to get the actual name that you want. In the interest or the data object. In flick four, we call these locator and that's the same word that we used for those prefix names for for the segmented interest and we should just change the names so we don't call two different things, locator, but whips. We'll fix that. So the routing hint locator are located under the node data. So this is the same place where we did our name construct definitions. So you can provide one or more routing hints and they're they're not used in any particular particular order, the they met the manifest processor could put any anyone or use all or, you know, whatever combination it wants So Yeah. And I believe that these are in... I don't remember if these are inherited also. I I I I'll I'll need to check that. I I know that the name construct are inherited.

So for example, if you want one set of rounding hits for sub manifest once it routing hits hints for application data, then you need to organize your tree So you only have one type of thing in each manifest. Object. So you would have a tree, for example, where the root manifest just points to sub. And and then sub only point to other sub or to application data, you don't mix it. This way, each of these data objects has the correct set of locator in it. For retrieving the data. You know, perhaps we need to restructure this, you know, based on usage. So if this is a common thing to have different routing hits for the manifest and the application data. We might wanna organize it more like the name construct where you can be you know, you can mix them more easily. So I didn't talk about encryption. I didn't talk about some of the other metadata like, sub tree sizes and and and things like that. I didn't talk about all of the naming scheme. So we have naming scheme like prefix name and interest drive name and data drive name. I only talked about the segmented name. Sc, since that's really what you would use for. I didn't talk about protocol flags there's also a way of of of of telling the flick processor to include certain protocol flags like must be fresh.
