We're very friendly gets to be nice and close We have two more documents we're going to look at, and then we'll have an AOB hopefully not too long an AOB, because remember we're taking stuff to the list to make substantive decisions. But next up we do have ORI with no hats on Hi, I'm Ori I'm here to talk to you about Spice Discovery and I'll share with you that I've been in several many, many sessions this IETF and I've seen each of them has a dot, each working group has their own document that has discovery and big bold letters on it. I hope that as we consider this topic, in Spice, we are paying attention to the work that's happening in those other areas and other working groups. And you'll see why in a second. That's it. Next So what is this spice discovery idea? so you've just seen that um there's these things they're called the you know credentials. They have some cryptography in them. That's interesting. They have a million different ways you can represent their payloads Some of them fantastically complicated. Some of them very simple Some of them are of them are available you know free and you can access the register and you can see what all the claims mean, otherwise you have to pay to access the registry to understand what the claims mean So there's all these different credentials, but, you know, what if you're just trying to understand if it given entity supports any of them? at all? So the idea with"

Let's say that you know, it's logistics. example, just for an example. So there's all kinds of different discovery mechanisms for domain names that we've seen within the IETF. And I've listed like a couple examples here You know, one is the simple get request with the well-known URL scheme. I think Mark is around here somewhere sitting in the front So thank Mark for well-known your eyes and other people who've worked and commented on this topic Yeah, sorry Well known your eyes are a structure for discovering information from a web server. And you're welcome to interrupt me along the way as I kind of walk my way through a couple of these different examples. Another example, would be the robots TXT formats and privacy TXT, you've maybe heard about people considering other formats like that in the context of like the AI control work Like I'm, I know there's this website I want to discover some information about it like you know understand its policy respect it interact with it. There's all you know, DNS discovery capabilities, and, you know, some of those records can be seen with it. There's also, you know, DNS discovery capabilities and, you know, some of those records can be signed, some of them are not. I'm not a DNS expert. So I'm sure many of you can tell me all of the wonderful benefits of DNS SEC and another group can get up and explain all the problems with it Maybe there's something there for us.

You learn of verification keys in case capabilities and credentials, there's some list identifiers here and our charter actually kind of restricts us in terms of what we think about here. So some of these examples are in like not we're not allowed to talk about them, but I put them here just to remind you that like these identities are, it's not just a domain names. There's other kinds of places where these things show up. Sometimes URLs get moved around in different places. So I think that's basically it. Next slide So why should we provide a document that describes at least one way to do discovery? We want to basically have a way of providing assurance that's related to confirmation methods So you heard, you know, in the SDJI, discovery. We want to basically have a way of providing assurance that's related to confirmation methods. So you heard, you know, in the SD JOT and SDCWT use cases, you have these confirmation claims, which are about the holder key binding, and that gives you confirmation that, you know, when a credential is presented, it's being presented from a device that the issuer, you know, wanted that credential balance to. Well, what if you wanted to know whether that device? was still trusted in a domain or was so associated with some other DNS information or HTTP information?

They're a little bit ahead of us, and they've already been thinking about a lot of these problems, and there's some great work there. And you know, what parts of Wimsy's discovery systems are relevant to us and what parts are not really appropriate for Spice? are relevant to us and what parts are not really appropriate for for spice so I don't I don't have the answers there I just think that you know we have to be paying attention to the other areas in the IETF where discovery is is happening and we need to figure out what parts of those discovery mechanisms does our charter allow us to be inspired by and work on and what parts are kind of out of scope Next slide.

So that's an interesting you know, topic. And I did work on a draft that was just thinking about the confirmation claim in JWT and CWT and DMT Just those topics together, like what if you were discovering confirmation claims? regarding holder keys in Hosey and Cozy? And what if you were trying to identify if an issue or a JWT or a CWT also had some other interests? information in the DNS? Open ID Federation is a thing, I don't know anything about. There are other folks who do. I'd love to hear from them what parts of Open ID Federation are relevant to SPICE and what parts maybe, you know, don't make sense. I think, Joseph had mentioned on the list at some point that, you know, we really ought to be considering what's happening with Open ID Foundation and the digital credential discussion capabilities in that ecosystem.

It's really a way to translate from one memorable thing to a bunch of other things that you don't want to remember all at once And as such, any discovery system, as you started to go into on the previous slide, needs to be really clear about what it's expected in inputs are as much as it is its expected outputs So is this something that's going to be user facing? Is it something that's going to absolutely never be user facing? Like you are People are never going to see URLs And read Temple's original docs for that. But in any case, the whole"

Discovery systems should be aware of it something like that. Like how do you reconcile? because otherwise therein lies many attacks? That didn't really have a question more of just an observation of where this could eventually fit in thank you Bye Hi your weekend projects are always some of my favorite things to read the there are some really good thoughts I think of this draft. One thing I'd noticed is you know, when I think about Spice, a lot of this is I'm thinking about how are we doing some more of this stuff and more of a C.B seabor, you know, kind of world rather than a JSON world. And there's a lot of application JSON in this draft. So I think there's seeds in here that maybe we can mull on and that maybe craft a draft that's like, maybe that's once we start looking at CNF and some of the other properties and discovery around that like in a CDCWT con maybe that's once we start looking at cnf and some of the other properties and discovery around that like in a c w t s d cwt context that they will help us figure out what some of the other properties and discovery around that, like in a CDCWT context, that they will help us figure out, well, what properties would we want to maybe tie back into DNA? and just web discovery using Seabor? other protocol discovery using Seaboard. So that's just kind of where my mind is, but I'm very glad you wrote this stuff down because it is common problems and patterns we see all the time So there's a ACE and and cope and there's a whole community of seabor"

So I think if we want to do that we better get have a have a chat with some of those folks because they're doing this right now and they're moving in IOT context and transport contexts And you hit a point that I think we struggled with when we were talking about the work originally and you heard it, you know, it's going to keep coming up Jason versus Seabor, why can't we be friends? Like, we have CWT claims The CWT registry requires you to point to the JWT registry for confirmation claims, like these things are, there is a chance to sort of have some unity here and to be in inspired and help each other, you know, make the stuff work And a lot of the Jason Discovery stuff is you know, pretty far ahead. So, and I'm also more familiar with it That's why that stuff's in the document, so sorry Hey. All right So yes, definitely go once on. So yes, definitely go, let's go talk to Joseph and learn about Open ID Federation. That's a good idea, right? But for one, for many reasons, but one important one is that discovery and trust establishment of Idea Federation. That's a good idea, right? And for many reasons, but one important one is that discovery and trust establishment are two different things, and they're often very easily confused you know, just because I found a key in the DNSSEC zone doesn't mean that I trust it for everything. And, you know, do you have a handbook? Do you understand how somebody manages, manage signing keys for their DNS set up? Probably don't, right? So I it's easy to focus on discovery and make it very, very simple and then like turn the discovering into a trust establishment mechanism. And that is dangerous. So I think that's one thing.

I mean, if you go to the phylo-sanitary convention issue, you load up in Rotterdam with a bunch of things, and then you go and load in in Tanzania, and by the time you've got there, you discover the credentials you had aren't good anymore, and they're literally baked on the palates you have. Do you turn around and go? back? It just doesn't seem to me seems to be the gap between when credentials are issued when they're, and when they're presented and verified means you need to think about the system evolution in a more system way and discovery doesn't feel to me like it's solving a problem there Yeah go ahead So Watson, I think you're actually passionate or trying to say some of the stuff that I was trying to get at, right? That trust management is and discovery should happen as part of the configuration of a system, not as part of a runtime of a system. And that the kind of situation you you you paint Watson is it's definitely related to that, right? yeah yeah i i think i hear an echo between what you said watson ladd Leif what you had said.

So like what happens? if that information changes it's not status update status lists you stuff, it's not OCSP you know, validity information, but it impacts the validity processing What do I do? Is that verified? Is that invalid? Do I reject this thing? Does the application crash? There's a lot of discovery.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has this global business identifier thing that they're doing and they say, hey, if you want to import things in the United States, it would be really helpful if you told us either, well, the GLN from GS1 or your Duns number, or there's this thing that Glythe has called an LEI, tell us one of those things.

I don't know probably a lot. There's the potential for this to be useful, it seems to me this way to have an unambiguous idea identifier that carries with it the context through which you can learn more about the entity that is identified. Next slide So the idea is really, really basic It was so basic that for a while I was like, does this even need to be? written down? And I thought, yeah, probably So next slide, here it is It's a URI It says glue And there's an IANA registry that has a bunch of authority identifiers that says this is the scheme that you use for this identifier. And the identifier that's the identifier that was assigned by the external authority. That's it. That's the idea It's pretty straightforward but it seems like it might be useful. So now this number, that we're like, hey, it's a number. Well, now I know it's a it's a number that was assigned by the United States IRS It's an entity identification number or an enterprise entity It's an EIN. Employer identification number. I got the wrong E all week But there it is But see, if I was able to go to the Ion of registry and look it up, I could find out that it's an employer identification number. I wouldn't have to guess.

Why are pens not enough Iiana has pens their enterprise numbers They look like globally unique identity enterprise numbers. So just you just said employees. So just elaborate on that use case.

Because the way of customs and global trade want to do this is all the way down to the raw materials in a lot of those small suppliers do not have computers, and they do not have a U.S entity so this scheme is to allow flexi this is all the way down to raw materials and a lot of those small suppliers do not have computers and they do not have a US entity. So this scheme is to allow flexibility worldwide, not limited to one Thanks, Roy. Okay So I have to have to respond to that I kind of want to keep with Q, but go ahead. Yeah, okay So globally uniqueness to pick requires an authority of very large things. And also you can, so the threshold here is registration, Diana so if you can't register the Ianna you need something else Otherwise, if that's not the threshold, then glue unique this. He just said to look at the website from Mrs. roy williams, from Brown Ianna was not listed as a member of the GBI and the government's dictating the source of authority of the numbers based on these companies are doing review and issuing a number for them unfortunately government does not recognize IANA as a member of the GBI"

I am queued and specifically- Go for Mike question as well as the prior one So currently we're tracking over 200 million unique businesses as parent entities, right? This is not counting subsidiaries and all the other fun things going on and that just currently active Additionally, we get into scenarios where each jurisdiction sometimes requires different identifiers for different purposes So a very good example is that USGov, if you were kind of contracted with them prior, used to utilize Duns, right, as a really common way of identifying who you are. They now have a UEI that actually is pinned that's a little bit separate, and those things tend to change over time. It doesn't invalidate your Duns number though, right? Our company still has a Duns number. We have a UEI we have a Cage Code, we have a separate entity number assigned in each jurisdiction with which in we're registered to do business And here's the interesting thing is that when we're dealing with regs or data that can deal with regulatory data, a lot of times you actually have to reference the exact subsidiary or the exact location of a subsidiary Some things deal with that like GLN and other things don't And so having that ability to go account for these different identifier systems to go look up where the registration is, what the meaning is, and then reference that unique entity as described in that jurisdiction or that registry system turns out"

I mean, I did some type nitpicking to pretend to be helpful to brent before that wasn't really helpful so i have some questions that i haven't read it in a bit I don't know the scope of where these identifiers can be used, but for instance, in the U.S government for public health care, everyone's favorite part of public health care is the accounting arm. So that's the center for me Medicare and Medicaid Services. There are taxpayer identifiers that are used for billing for like medical providers Almost all those taxpayer identifiers are not sensitive except if you're dealing with sole proprietors There are doctors that are basically their own business. And then it's a social security number. So you can't, those are toxic You can't share those anywhere in government. And then any time one of those is that accidentally copy and pasted, it would cause an incident for government contractors so maybe I'm saying, like, I would probably want to see more of these things like a bigger enumeration of what you're talking about. I guess there needs to be some privacy considerations, but I don't see how you can have with the current structure just talking about this unless you layer it some way with some other part of spice or something else.

I don't know if that really something can solve in the privacy considerations, but I can open up an issue in the GitHub and try to like talk through this, but that's about identity I know about that are used in different domains that are not the ones that are currently slated, but probably will come up for other use cases on identifying legal entities that are really individuals and cause private concerns.

But I do talk about that a little bit, but it looks like Roy's at the mic too roy williams. The way I think of this is slightly different, which is in the case of shipping for physical products, they want to know the factory and from the stitching we have to do for ownership it's back to the corporate identity. So we kind of need some identity mechanism for corporate and then issue factory identity based off the previous one to walk it back this is in this case how it would be established and then the numbers are specific to the identities because of the location specific information for LEI.

Is that something that you have in mind? mind? like just arbitrary organizations? creating these identities or is it all about government identities? So the examples that I threw into the doc are like the Duns, the LAI, the GLN. So it's you know well-known organizations that have a business of identifying businesses. Those are the ones that we thought of it at first as you know, that would fit well with this scheme. But if anybody, like if Neoflow, for example, wanted to stand themselves up as an identifier of oil companies, then they would be in a position of authority to do so. And people who know oil companies would be like, oh, Neoflow we trust them to do this identification So the goal of the registry is more here's the list of possibilities for people to look at not to, we don't want to pick favorites or anything There will be different contexts in which different values will be more apt Makes sense all right so uh"

Or do I mean the grandfather of them all, the Internet Society, by which I can refer to 54-16504? if I have this identifier it's a way of being exact. Next slide. To sum up we want a glue ID so that we have a representation format that adds the explicit authority context to the business identifier so that the identifier bears with it the information that you need to figure out what the heck it means That's pretty much it"

We don't want to be super picky about what those authorities are at this stage, like you are naming authority. Awesome you're in the registry. It's just an identifier at this point. We don't have any binding to keys We don't have any authentication of the claimed identifier bill into it. It's just an identifier at this point. But we can imagine those use cases being built on top of it in clever and well-reasoned ways Okay, so we did, so we spoke a bit of time on this one. I do, so we close the queue just to try and keep things under control. I do see that there's there have been a couple more questions, but I wonder in terms of next steps I don't think it's, it's ready for a working group adoption call, but it certainly may be for people who are interested, I think reaching out to Brent would be a really good idea to polish this up and bring it back Yeah, it's definitely ready for people to read it and poke holes at it and tell us the things that you would rather see different. So please do And thanks to Pam for making these slides for me And that brings us to Aob A-O-B. And I'm hitting the button wait, hit that button and hit that button, okay Keep it quick. I know it's not in the charter as one of the other working groups to coordinate with but just want to remind everybody that we're having a happy time creating identifiers of our own over in the drone remote identity"

So with that, I do look forward to see probably chatting with you guys on Slack and we've got a few things we want to talk about on the list I didn't ask for a note taker. I'm actually going to go back in for my own edification and polish these up into notes and get them in a few days So thank you all for coming to the first Spice Working Group And safe travels for wherever you make go next That's okay They're going to run it Bye All right Okay Then you may catch it, otherwise we'll see you there It sounds like it's not a conflict line but I know It's still early to figure that out know, to figure that out, but yes?"
