So that we don't need to carry the color inside NRI And the service services can be allocated from the cspace of the corresponding colorful locators. these colorful locators are Then traded as a colorful prefix by BGP protocol.

And the resolutions of the CP routes to the intro domain internal web pass is based on the NetHub color topper, which is the well established mechanism in the are in the BGP and in SR technologies And with the CPR, we also have some advantage in the data plane because we can optimize data data encapsulation to reduce the the encapsulation overhead. because taking advantage of the IP reachability of the SRV 6 c c's We can use IP longest prefix matching based on the services, so that it can match to the CPR routes. to steer the HR reseller services into the corresponding internal wear parts And with this, we can remove the dependency on the dedicated SRV6 transport seat in the dead plane. so that we can have a better encapsulation efficiency.

So it's a quick agenda. I won't take much of your time. So just present the changes to the draft since the last time it was presented in IDR and interim on October 2022. And I won't go through the recap in detail. I'll just provide it as a you can just go through it later if at all just for reference. And we'll go through a few use cases that are coming up where customers are interested in using this. and the next steps. So the main changes to the draft are some removals. Okay. basically, we removed the propagation scope checker the BGP attribute announcement draft solves this problem as a clear attribute scope. And we thought it's better just stick with that instead of having a separate mechanism attribute as well. and we plan to introduce a per route propagation scope checker in future. that"

So this keeps the M and h clean lean and confined to forwarding on attributes. And there are some editorial changes to make the draft look better. and I added some illustration of use cases that we're gonna discuss now. and the INA section is being reviewed and updated. So this is just a background of how we plus next hop in BGP. This was presented in the last interim. Here, we just wanna point out that we have cases that are getting added, very quickly, like the secondary label attribute, which is gonna be presented today. and FSB 2 has some redirect to IP actions. So all these cases are, like, organically, they are cluttering with VGP. in a way. And it's it's good if you can find them all in a scope of a single attribute where we can have them homogeneously work on all service layers, irrespective of whether it is ipipv4mplsflowspec. So this is also just a recap of the problems. So here, we just say why AdPath, what is the problem? And the other use cases I'll just skip over this. So this is the birds of you of the multinextrot attribute. Basically, it it has multiple TLVs, and it just basically, what we have is a forwarding instruction. which is nothing but a forwarding action and a set of arguments. And we have a primary path, which consist of a few forwarding instructions. a backup path which consists of a few of of ordering instructions and the labeled script."

So in the regular way, we will just do ad part of, let's say, send 4 feeds through the RR, with the link bandwidth community, which is specifying how much traffic should come through each of these routes. And the region to r 2 will just do a multipath consuming the link bandwidth community. And so we see that the number of routes that we need to advertise, it it's it's basically based on number of next steps we want to do. So it's like rip the rib, it actually becomes 4x. And this is a problem for the RR, which is having a reboot for x and for r 2 as well, which is having a Rev 4x. And these problems some customers, they are interested in solving using a manage. where in a manage the same thing can be expressed using 1 BGP route. but the unmanage has a primary path with multiple forwarding instructions. We just says forward to the specific router with whatever ECMP we want. it reduces remote scale by at the r r by four times and also reduces the lock grip. because the same information is being carried by the same attribute. And this is a similar scenario, for entry VPN CEs. So today, we cannot even express these things. unless we use unique RDs and AdPath, which again increases the scale.

So these are the few use cases. that are coming about. And as we saw, we have other use cases like FlowSpak, which can also work based on that.

So We presented, this slides at the interim, and This is just a refresher. photos who couldn't attend the interim. Here is the problem statement. Why are we doing this? networks today have common administrative entity that span across multiple autonomous systems, that could be by evaluation or mergers and acquisitions and partnerships and whatnot. And, typically, when you cross EVGP boundaries, you lose attributes. And we want to have those attributes carried across different ASEs to have a better control. This is predominantly for ASE under single administrative domain, not just random. set of EPGPases. Yeah. Next slide, please. So how are we doing it? We came up with a new pairings type here. And this means we are not explicitly exchanging capabilities. Now authors, they talk about this topic to depth. We understand capabilities. However, Just as you have EPGP, ibgp, Conferred BGP, it seems counterintuitive to establish a session exchange your capability and say, nope. let's go over to an OLED like fashion and leak attributes here. This is predominantly why we set up a new session type. And the second thing is we would like operators to explicitly configure this without automating it. So both ends know what they're talking about from a session perspective. happy to take this discussion at the or or the email if you like. but there has been a certain method to amend this just in case you're wondering."

Well, one side is going to assume ebgp and another side is going to assumeebgpored. But this is exactly what happens to 42 71. in some sense, what happens if you have one site configured as IBC another site configured as ebgpUO session comes up. but then everything becomes a way we the whole idea again here is that both sides operators, have certain agreement, certain set of consensus before they go ahead something like this. Next slide, please. So what did we change in version 2? We did get a lot of feedback. And we have beefed up error handling, as to how we are doing it. Secondly, the decision process has been modified a little bit. You typically have EPGPO IBGP. Now you have a new session type that you wanna prefer that comes in. We've also had a text for route announcements for this kind of a session, which means you do not exchange any routing information unless and until outbound and inbound policies are explicitly set, and they can be set configured with null policies that's totally fine.

It is under the assumption. Many services especially those low latency services have multiple instances instantiate. in different edge data centers.

Some services may require a higher bisexual bandwidth among all their micro services, Some services may require, like, a huge storage service So based on the property of each side. So different service ID can have a different reference index. And preference index is also used to achieve sticky services, stickiness meaning that when you migrate roaming from one cell tower to another cell tower. If they do require a sticky service, And that preference number a preference index can be utilized to achieve that And then one change we made in this draft in this revision is we changed to the service delay prediction. So the ideal case is to find the edge data center with the fastest processing time. but it's really it's very difficult to predict which side has fastest processing time.

This could be because of particular convention is happening at this particular cell site. So I track lots of user device roaming to that site.

    "text": "First of all, background for quick. Most of you who have actually been looking at things that TIFF. Now it's a new protocol. It's a transport runs over UDP. has properties that are low latency. It has encryption built into it, certificates, know things that we all love from TLS or maybe hate. And most importantly, for this presentation, it supports multiple screens. it's the streams that we're gonna be talking about here is the primary thing. a thing I'm going to note as part of this presentation. We are in our specs at the point of having good discussion about what we want the shape of the feature look like. significant numbers of details are yet to be filled in. we're happy to take input, but we are gonna fill them in. question is why would we even be thinking about this? Well, my career, I've run DGP over any sort of weird things that happen to have, no properties of a stream session. quick is just the latest of these things, but this is also a chance to do something a little bit different So what we're really looking at is actually multichannel BGP where each channel can be successfully reset asymmetrically, And the consequence there is we are hoping to get better resiliency for BG as a protocol when run over this transport. We already have extensions that let us do some of the things here at least specified. Some of them had to fit prototype or deployment, and they haven't been popular for various reasons. ones that are relevant is the multisession, which know, the implementers apparently were unhappy about because of the ensuring that being in the same connection causing issues. of course, we have dynamic capabilities, which also allows us add or remove things and hasn't been popular for whatever reason. we're also looking at the fact that we get enhanced security out of here. You know, the symmetric security that we get out of a0nmd5. there's certainly enough to make a lot of the operators happier than they used to be. security folk are still not quite thrilled with them. and eventually things that we're interested in is interesting scenarios that are maybe for later"

    "text": "quick supports connection migration. So perhaps we'll have no interesting applications where Half of VGP can move its endpoint. So so very quick terminology, and I gotta blast my way through here. But really important thing out of this is that HP over quick is about what we're calling channels, way to think about a channel is the channel is a instance or half instance of a BGB state machine. the details of what we're doing to the state machinery will be discussed in detail next round. what the relevant part is, you know BGP, you largely know how this works. We're only doing some mildly kinky things to actually get the job done. So We do the basic thing. We're gonna establish TLS connection over quick. We're going to put into it that we want a specific ALPN. BO keys, what we're choosing to use, we're also suggesting that we don't put anything else on there. Although, our conversation last night suggests maybe it might be interesting to do other things, like, RPKI, have the conversations about that later. And once we got the transport session up, we're gonna do is we're gonna establish 2 classes of channel The first one is the control channel. It is bidirectional. It resembles a standard EGP sessions in many respects But, really, what we're doing aside from the fact that's special about, you know, stream 0, is that it's gonna carry in his open messages the box to box capabilities. There are no address families that are intended to be exchanged. These are not carried control channels. Alright. So things like the role capability, your AS number, all these other things that are appropriate for the box to box communications, the box to box whole timer for the connection Those are passed around. everything else is going into function channels. And, you know, these are effectively per athlete per safie. There's expected to be 1 any given direction at a time. There'll be a violation to have more than one of these things. Quick allows us to do bidirectional and unidirectional streams. We are doing unitirectional streams in this case. they can be initiated by either side."

This means that we can have things like each POS being a right only protocol, and you don't have to have anybody send you anything back the other direction. but also, allows you to do the exact same thing for something normal, like IPD 4 unicast for the Internet. We have unredentials and the sessions. What this means is what it consequences If you lose or have an error on one side, You know, swapping a million routes on the Internet these days. You don't have to take down both sides of things. This is property for resilience that we find interesting. In terms of what we need to do, this means that our TCP Like, framing has to change a little bit But this is in the notation that they like out of the quick land. And, basically, the easy way to look at this is we are throwing an or TLV wrapper around a standard BGPU, BGP unchanged as hiding on the inside of all of this. This is a thing that we're trying to do. change as little BGP as possible, some of the conversations we're gonna have is Are you really doing bgb5? Well, let's have that conversation that moves on. Not right now. think about as weirdbeachv4. And either it's a control channel and you have an extra field in there to choose who you're addressing across the control channel. or you have just the function channel, and this is for an Aphi's Aphi. You know, this i chart for, you know, the actor diagram, is largely what we've just been discussing. Our first four lines are the standard by directional build up a standard DGP session bi directionally. session comes up. No. 8, let's b to say that I wanna do ipv4 unicast. you're actually sending things in the initiating direction, the active side goes across the screen. When you're applying to something that is a unidirectional thing, you do that on the control channel. general ideas, anything that is intended to be a response, from a passive portion of a state machine. just passes over the control channel."

We're gonna always do that on the control channel. at questions start becoming interesting things like the hold timers. What do you do about that? are gonna use the control channel for standard box the box whole time. This means we get all the usual properties we want in terms of is the box to box up. we're also gonna be making recommendations that the peraffy safy function channels have a much longer whole time. You know, whole time. in the sense that maybe you want to, you know, just like the send hold timer and stuff. You want to see that the Effi Saffi is still alive. You know, we'll have more conversations about the details that in the future draft. One of the things that we're gonna do upfront to enable work for later is we're gonna throw a capability in there in cases where the box wants to take a specific quick role as either the client or the server. And for the most part, for standard, you know, BGP connections, it's going to be the any role. You know, we're not expecting anything weird here, but let's say that you want to be the client because you expect maybe in a situation where you have a fabric Your server is a fixed piece of hardware, and maybe your clients are virtualized hosts that are popping up that may want to have some level of mobility, a virtual machines. Quick allows this sort of thing. That's a nice feature. that mobility also indirectly talks about another feature quick that's very fascinating for us. It'd operations land, have the ability to reestablish connections that have been interrupted. So one of the things we'll be looking at is a, you know, restart type scenario, maybe where we temporarily lose connectivity. Has it been a short enough period of time? Well, rather than gracefully be just starting, we just simply Keep moving along as if nothing's happened. So to do's. Like I said, there's a huge amount of work for us to fill in the gaps for this presentation is just to socialize the high level idea that we're providing encryption, that we're providing these"

But that said, we have people that are really good about PKI type stuff that will help us work through the profiles that make sense for the different deployments. how do we actually share the certificates for environments where it's a little bit tricky. maybe these things get posted in our PI, for example, We'll discuss those details later on. meanwhile, this is to get you thinking maybe salivating at the idea of new features.

The problem is that the the connection layer does not share appropriate fate if they're completely separate, you know, a TCP, the things do not coordinate with each other. The timers do not coordinate each other. Whereas within quick, the connection is controlled from inside of one black box that is quick itself. So that's the primary answer to you. Thank you.

Just to confirm, the the 3rd point, the delivery order, you are considering here what happens if things raised past each other that previously would be ordered by it being on one session. Right? Yep. Prioritization is one of the strong discussions that the co authors have been having. Juniper's implementation, for example, allows for a very robust prioritization mechanism that currently goes through a single pipe and therefore has the properties you're thinking about Once we go to multiple streams, we lose that a bit. And concerned you're calling it prioritization because I would call it serialization, which is much stricter of requirements but but it's kind of the same thing. So okay. I'm happy you're about you, I think, how to do this. Yep. We're totally thinking about it. And what's actually interesting more than the prioritization in terms of the sending side as utilization."

I think the most advantage is that the BDP session will work to be expire again anymore because keep on live. message account, be conveyed from the control panel. Right? So but I'm worry about if the because the control channel is different from the update channel. Right? Right? So What if, the control message is delivered correctly.

Now in terms of the draining capability, it's possible that a receiver may completely stall address family either by bug or by a purpose This means that we'll be looking at functionality, like, the send hold timer as a that we'll be discussing. I'd the second sort of piece of that is that starvation in general is going to be far more of a discussion as part of this because quick, you are responsible mostly in most implementations at user land to make sure that the state machinery for the streams is taken care of.
