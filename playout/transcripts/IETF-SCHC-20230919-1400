    "text": "session id2 for management but in that case it means that we lose one bit on each packet so because we discussed this one bit that we lose because we can't comprise the session anymore um there was also the the basically the point that they have in mind is if you use in any case something you have to place the MAC address uh to the right guy and so that only works on one hub but if you if you want to manage a device over IP from a distance you probably need uh UDP as well remember the the conversation and if you do then the alternates share your DP address with your your punishments so it's a different format that's when you do it from remote to iudb but if you do it from remote over UDP when we ask for a UDP Port which says check we could also have a second UDP Port which does Shake management I don't know it's just something at the table as well okay and and yeah and by the way you lose the beat on if you do management right because the default you could have a rule which does not have oh no if all the rules must you must always have a right if you have more than one so you would always pay for the rule ID even if everything else is implicit as soon as you have more than one yes if you have only one rule you don't pay for the rule ID if you have several rights"
