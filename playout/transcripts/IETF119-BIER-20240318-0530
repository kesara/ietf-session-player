Okay. I'd like to start my talk with a short recap what we already presented at the last IETF I also want to reiterate over our motivation and the concept for solution And then I'd like to talk about some updates on our mechanism, which we call segment encoded explicit trees, or short seat. I will show an innovation where we compare seeds with plain beer and then I'm going to conclude my talk. Next slide, please. Okay. What is the motivation for this talk as well as our talk at itfone 18. It is when we look at be a bit strings that have typically a length of 256 bits. So 32 bytes. Then these bit string lengths are not large enough to cover large networks. And therefore, when we have a large beer domain, we partition that domain into mod sets we each set has at most 256 notes And then we use the set identifier to indicate the semantic of a bit string for that set. This way rescaled Build to larger domains. However, when we have these large domains, we have many sets and then we need a single packet copy per set that has a receiver in it. And this may lead to redundant packets on a link when this link is shared. To reach different sets. We quantified this, problem with the following experiment we already presented, similar results at the last IETF But this time, we have a small change in it. We look at the beautiful name with 1024 core nodes And this time, optimize that identifiers the last time the mapping between beefer, and said was randomized this time it is globally optimized on the BN network. We have an average snow degree"

And now we look at the relative additional packets that we need with beer to reach our receivers compared to native IP multicast, That means when we have a value of 2 we need twice as many packets on all links in the network with field. Compared to Alpi Malawi cars, which is the optimal solution. And what we can see here is that with small bit string sizes 32 bytes. We have at most a factor of 1.8 This means that we need 1.8 as many packets with beer to reach all destinations as with IP multicast. And of course, with larger bit string sizes, This factor decreases, but it's always larger than 1. So we are not optimal in that manner. Next slide, please. That's why we came up with a more generic way to stateless logic costs routing where the idea was the following we have a multicast distribution tree and we translate this distribution tree into a list of sequential instructions and encode these trucks in a packet header, instead of using a flat peer bit string. And when we do that, we don't need any sets or set identifiers as lower as we have enough header space, And, of course, if we have the limits on the header space because forwarding ASICs can only process certain number of bytes, then we need to split that header some multiple packets as with you And the forwarding principle here is the following we have decoded multicast tree. And then when we receive such a tree, for example, at node 2, we split the packets or the header into its subtrees have here a subtree for node 3. And node 4."

    "text": "And then we forward the subtree to its corresponding next hop So node 3 receives a packet that has only the subtree of 3 and node 4 receives a package that has only the subtree for node 4. So the package strings along the forwarding path. Next slide, please. We implemented this generic concept with our mechanism, which recall segment encoded explicit trees. Or short seat. Seed uses domain wide segment IDs to address a note. Like, in segment routing, And this concept is already included and draft a CAP RTS forwarding. And the good thing with these global identifiers with this global sits is that we can address that a several hops away with a single segment So when we have them a longer path. We don't have to encode any hot with it, can just address the remote note at the end. Of the path. Next slide, please. As a short example, how seed worked, what we already presented at the last ITS, I mishear an example, So we have a seat packet with a seat header that has several segments in it here on the left 2nd 1 to 2nd 5. Each segment is composed of an identifier to live updates and a length field. The length field indicates how many bytes are part of this distribution tree after the second And the forwarding is now as follows we received such a packet we'll look at the first identifier in the first segment And if this identifier identifies the processing mode, then we do something, Otherwise, we just forward the second this package are calling to identify for example, when we address the remote notch, then, then, then, check if the the little bit is set This means that we are a receiver the distribution tree if this is the case, make a packet copy and pass it up to layers. And otherwise, we removed the first segment, and now we are in the middle figure here."

  {
    "startTime": "00:26:04",
    "text": "And the following process is repeated until no segment is left. We look at the first segment that is now on the stack. And look at the length field. Then we make a packet copy we copy the first segment and the next l byte into that packet. This gives us the first packet on the right at the upper side we get a new packet which has the segments 2, 3. And for for example, Then we removed the first segment of the original packet as well as the next lbyte. And then repeat look at the next In this case, the second 5. And we do the same. So we get from one seed packet get we get 2 c packets for each packet has to corresponding subtree in its header as just a zone, a zone indeed generic encoding example. This approach has a problem because we need for each receiver at least one segment so that we can indicate the deliverables that that we want to give a packet copy to it. And the segment is 2 bite, 3 bite, 4 bite large depending on the identifier. So it's rather inefficient to encode many receivers. Next slide. That's why we thought what is the most efficient way to replicate a packet to many neighbors in an efficient way. And of course, the answers, that's why we introduced a new field and they had a the so called bit string indicator field the bebits. And this bit indicates that a segment is not followed by other segments. But by a bit string, either it completes beer header, like an encapsulation, or appear like midstream with beer semantic. Next slide, please. And with this approach, we can do the following month. Assume we have a part of a distribution tree"

    "text": "where we're from a permanent ultimate hub with ID 1052, that has 2 leafs connected to it which are receivers of that tree are 1 and are 3. And now we can do the following. Within our segment, we addressed the note 1052. The deliverment is set to 0 and the bit string indicator bit is set to 1 the b bit. And if the B bit is set, then we split the blank field which normally says how many bytes are part of the distribution tree into 2 small fields into the bit string length, that indicates how many the length of the bit string in bytes that follows that segment and set identifier that is used as in beer with the same semantic So for example, the value 17 here is split into 2 values bit string length with one bite. So with a one byte bit string that follows that segment, and the set identifier that says that this bit string has the semantic of set 1. We get a bit string, afterwards, which is here in our 5, And as in beer, this bit string says that's the 1st and the third neighbor should receive a packet copy and we couldn't do the, normal beer logic here. So in this example, we are able to address 2 neighbors of that pen off the top a single byte instead of at least two segments, which would be at least 6 or 8 bytes. We are really efficient here. Of course, if there would be more neighbors that need a packet copy, we could simply flipped a bit. So what this does is basically we tunnel beer overseas to a distribution node to a pan ultimate top. And there, we can do then the efficient replication via peer. The advantage with this approach is that we can combine the traffic engineering capabilities of seed so we can traffic engineer our paths to the distribution notes to the apps of our distribution tree and then"

And with this approach, we have less OEM overhead compared to beer and especially compared to BRTE because in BRTE, we would need to assign the different links to different sets that we can still do useful traffic engineering this whole problem doesn't exist with Next slide, please. We also evaluatives this new approach with a similar experiment as in the motivation slide So again, with a pure domain with 1024 core nodes. With optimized BER set identifiers, Ever is no degree of 4. Each core node has 60 leaves, this different bit string lengths from 32 bytes to 256 bytes. And again, every sauce that's a package. To end receivers averaged over 20 runs. And now we compare the number of packets that seed requires to reach our receivers compound compared to beer, And when we have here a beer bit string length of 32 bytes, this also means that the seed header is limited to 32 bytes in total. And when it's generated. So we have have rather small seat headers. And what we can see here that when we have a small number of receivers between 4 and 2 to the power of 8 then we are I need less packets, the beer to reach all receivers And if we have a large number of receivers, we are basically in the same order of magnitude, SB with the number of perceive us. But we still have the traffic engineering capabilities of seats we don't have in beer We both need BRTE. And DoTE makes everything way complex. And it's also less efficient when we have a limited header size with beer because we need the bits for the different links. Next slide, please.

We'll bring that stuff forward as well and, take the full vote. The list and move on. But stick around because, Greg and I ran to each other in the hallway earlier and brought up something interesting It's actually IETF wide, but it's specifically to OEM right now. And that is, before this work, Really began with the beginning of this work, there was a requirements draft. And it's kind of been my experience in the IETF that we write problem statements. We write requirements draft, and they're used to develop the solutions. But then they're never published and they fall off and become basically a archive and you gotta dig them up. And so We fail as a group. To to to publish our history, right, to document it in a way that's easy to find without going back and looking for spire graphs. So, question Greg had is like, should we take this requirements draft forward and publishes information. And there may be some resistance about that, but just taking the beer example, I I'm I believe I wrote the, the problem statement originally for the beer working group. And in that was a robust narrative about why we are, what we are, I thought it'd be a nice piece of history to go forward. And at the time, there was no interest. The ADs even chuckle at the idea of publishing, a problem statement strapped. And here we are now in M1D, trying to document all the reasons why we are where we are and something that draft narrative makes a lot of sense that needs to go in there. It's like if it was already published, we could have just pointed moved on. So I think, my own personal learning through the process, I think it would be helpful. If we were to publish requirements drafts,"

Because, like I said, the e AD feedback I got in the past was, okay. The work what we move forward and not the process and that may have changed. Andrew? Glinter? Thoughts, Steven? This a bit of discussion within the IESG about publishing use case drafts, etcetera, etcetera. Some of the time, you know, it it requires justification of why you're doing it. You know, that needs to be clearly stated that we're publishing those for these reasons, They may tell you to create the draft never published it as well. So I think that it's probably a discussion you should have with Gunther as the incoming ADC, how he wants to take it forward. Personally, I think that use case drops can be thin useful at times Whether or not they are published, they're still worth having in the record. Depth. It just my experience is if they don't get published, they'd kinda vanished into the archive, and there's there's not an obvious way to find them unless you're specifically looking for them. I mean, that's that's a discussion worth having. I think we've got, Yeah. And, good.

Is actually very relevant because it will actually help you tune technology, you know, going forward and and keep you know, track off you know, developing the right things because otherwise it's very easy to get, like, off track doing, you know, spending a lot of energy and time in very niche solutions, which nobody really, you know, will will use. And the other benefit of this use case documents is it often triggers another audience to look into these documents because is more tailored towards people using these technologies. There is not necessarily, you know, what people you know, you know, implementing these technologies are are trying to do.

Even the expired you can still find it. That's why impression. Another one is that it seems that's, for before, the big ticket items starts, for example, working group stars, it's natural to to to to require use case and problem statements and those kind of those are definitely required.

We'd like to design a method that can minimize reliance on unique us routing reconvergence after the failure and we hope it can be compatible with existed via protocol and signal We also hope this necessary can be friendly to existing hardware platform. Therefore, we proposed a failure protect mechanism using any cost and bypass MPLS label. Different VFRs within one side share same end cost label. So that they can be combined as one entry in the upstream site. If asked brief table. While different bypass labels are utilized between BFS within one side so they can forward BR packets to each other. Next slide, please. Currently, while failure occurs at length, between PE3 NPE5, the failure recovery procedure goes like this. IGP protocol firstly recalculate a new reachable next hop towards PE5, which is PE6. The IGP protocol will no find this without to be a protocol, and beer will update beer routing table and then beer forwarding table. During this procedure, control plan and data plan update happens when failure already causes packet loss. Next slide, please. We introduce any cost and bypass label, and they work like this. So firstly, BGP and IGP protocol change their protocol messages between in each BFos, in particular, each BFI advertises the new beer info subset TLV, the format is shown in the figure. There are a bypass label and any cluster MPLS label contained within the sub tier v. Any cost MPLS label should be distinct among sites."

Because BF ERC and D share the same end cost label, their BFID will be combined together into one entry in the beef. And their NCAS label will be recorded in the table as well. That any cost label will be used the 1 pack beer packet needs to be encapsulated on VFRB. Before link failure happens, the flow can be forwarded from btod and finally to CE. Next slide, please. When link failure happens between b and d, link failure can be notified to bear and the original beer neighbor d cannot be used anymore. So neighbor c will be automatic been chosen and used for bare for warding. When beer package is folded from B to C, the anchor's label 3 will be used to locate beefs table. The destination beach 2, within the bid stream will be used to look up the beef to table. C will find out that neighbor D is the destination, and it will forward be a package to D. In weird header by past label 32 is encapsulated. Finally, D will forward the package towards C During this procedure, no beer packet will be dropped because the backup entry has been calculated in advance. Next slide, please. So there are several advantages of this message. Such as that failure recovery is immediately performed. There is no additional bill packet addition. VFR won't modify as existing behavior of packet encapsulation. Besides the reliance on IGP convergence are minimized. The uniqueness of BFID and BRF are not affected. Next slide, please.
