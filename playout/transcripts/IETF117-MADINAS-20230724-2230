Then we have a taxonomy of MAC address selection policies with different policies. and but, basically, the the content of the dock. Sorry. Regarding the taxonomies, this is the list that we have currently in the draft. you can see that there are different behaviors depending on what the operating system may do, what the device may do, per device, for example, when you generate a random MAC address when you boot you keep using that for the for the lifetime of device, you can do that per boot. So you generate a MAC address that is different every time you put the device, you can do that per network. So on"

So this document has been ongoing since we had a quarter rich set of updates, as you can see here. we are today in update 6, which is your I would say not minor, but not a major update compared to V5. where, essentially, on the list, we received few comments telling us that we are missing the ipv6 side of the house, we have FPV 4 covered, you know, in the definition of problems and and services, especially DHCP and alike. but we are missing the the the ipv6 equivalent. So we added to that document. the product in the 6 that we had in the 4th And, of course, in the addition to the ACP, we have a select that was added.

We kept those sections 7 elements in in the end of the document for well. until the PCP started to be available at an less to release, less face to face. and remove or remove it. If you go to the next slides, what I think these documents lead us with in this definition of use cases where We've identified these different environments from home to public Wi Fi through campus management, shelter, and enterprise.

Also, who is managing the network. and what kind of complexity of network services and advanced of network support you expect when you are in these different departments.

And it seems to us, you know, author of these documents, that the home, the managed residential campus, and the enterprise would be places where RCM appearing there might be a need for the network or, you know, whoever is running the network to be able to reidentify the machine so as to access to allow the access to the same resources, same time, another group, 8 to 11 BI, is looking into how you improve the privacy of 8 of the 11, and I think, of course, that this is useful everywhere But in particular, every place where there is the notion of people being easily accessing your communication.

The question is what do we solve above those layers? the queue is a question I would like to ask the group. see at the bottom, I have a couple of notes you know, more for myself than anything else. we know we've discussed in the past, there's probably good practices in how we implement DHCP the 46 or Slack. both on the clients and the infrastructure.

So this is largely reaction to the fact that devices are randomizing the MAC addresses. and what are the the quote, unquote damages are the things that are broken in dot 11 as a result of that that we can try to find ways to repair without causing any new privacy issues We've gone through a fair fairly long process of developing scoping and listing out what all those issues were that we thought were relevant."

In a second, we do have a draft 1.0 for that amendment, which has passed the initial working group letter ballot with a pretty strong approval. So that's really good progress. TGI is kind of a second project following behind BH, and it is looking at further issues around privacy and how to protect on PPI that's carried in various ways various ways devices can be tracked. It's kind of building on top of b h, which, like I said, is sort of the immediate fix two problems that are randomized back address caused. and going beyond just randomizing MAC addresses to what other information should be dealt with to help to help protect that the personal information. So a bit of update on where we are with tgbh, So this was the one that's just a a reactive program We have created a draft 1.0, roughly, the content is around 2 mechanisms. One is known as the device ID. which is a token, if you will, that's generated by the network and provided to the device so that that device can be recognized going forward once the network has establish some understanding of who that device is, or has some context that's connected to that device. if that device leaves the network and comes back, for example, you're using a captive portal at a hotel. and you go away for the day, you come back that evening and wanna get back onto the portal, they can recognize that this is the same device that came even if your device randomizes its MAC address to something new in the meantime. the intent here is that that device ID is not necessarily providing any real information might just be garbage to anybody externally. It might even be garbage to the device that self,"

So kind of 2 different ways to solve the problem. There are different use cases that feel more applicable to either of them, although I suspect kind of either mechanism could be used for most of of the use cases. A lot of this, as mentioned at the bottom, is a mechanism to identify the device when it comes back. but I'll point out there's also some use for recognizing the device as it is coming back before it has actually associated So we are leveraging a mechanism that came in 8 or 2 to 11az called Hesson, which allows some pre association security so that the device can be identified as it's starting to come back to the network, but still doing pre association mechanisms. but within a secure context.

IEEE has put a new process in place I, unfortunately, I can't tell you when the document will be available. I did just double check today, and it's not available yet, but it should be very soon. so they're working through their process. So One answer is that anybody who's got an IEEE membership, largely almost anybody in the public can get their hands on the document for a price but you'll see here I underscored that I think it makes sense for us to try to establish a better liaison relationship between the IOTF Modernas group and the and the IEEE Group that's working on this to see if we can share the draft free of charge to your members. something we can work on offline and see if we can if we can sort that out For the rest of the process, just to give everybody an understanding, It goes through a working group churn of a couple of ballots and then it goes to what's called SA balloting in the IEEE process. at that point the draft is usually considered to be pretty stable and ready for implementations to start. The target for that is in Marchofnextyear with final publication expected in Q3. BI, I will try to talk to this as best I can because I don't Carol here. These are her slides.

We have a cybersecurity service that is using the PKI that, again, allows the different, you know, branches of of the layers to for the players to service their their their customers.

So that's everyone in the world virtually providing a Wi Fi service. So it could be an enterprise, could be, you know, your city, households, so any Wi Fi network, Then we have on the right hand side the identity providers, So the IDPs, again, these are the owners of a user identity.

So moving forward, I think because this is naturally, you know, an IETF meeting, I'm you know, happy to share that. We can even say that the situation was built on on IITF protocols, and I think that was the sentiments of our shares and and the member joining that okay, if we have, you know, RFCs that have been available for so long, and they have been proving, you know, year after the year, technology after technology, they can work. They are reliable. Let's make sure we use them. So here, you can see some of the most in climatic examples, but if you look into, you know, dotonex it based authentication.

And definitely, if there are alignment opportunities, that's one of the messages we bring here today. for for the IETF community. Okay. Along these lines, what then important as the definitions and the way we try to leverage ready to market technology, you know, reduce innovation cycles, do this tech transfer was the usage of embedded unique identifiers So I mentioned the 3 layers. Right? So for the PKI, that there will be a work with Diana and the ATF reviewers to create a new namespace So there is a double BID now as an official namespace the radius at reboot 1 to 6. So these are at the same level. As for instance, the static codes from the testMA, And the members are using it really for, you know, data changes between the parties, but also on the UID of the of the PKI, the the X 509 certificates. there is this unique identifier that can be used. also, the certificate based roaming. So there is a policy identifier where there will be PKI leverages our our pen number. So that was another one that is available to those participating.

We mentioned the RadSec technology, but also the certificate policy is an active group within the WPA. So this is not car on stone, So if there are changes, improvements There is always a possibility to go and look into these policies and evolve them over time. also very important that all the signaling between the INPs and the IDPs as well the federation APIs are secured by with mutual TLS. So all the systems that are managed from the station's standpoint, are are available. And if you look here into the this chart, so we have really these 3 levels. So level 1 is managed by the BBA. So the root CA. the same with the policy ICI. where we instantiate that will be a policyoid that then get gets distributed over the chain. Starting on level 3, important enough to mention that the issuing ICAs are operated by brokers, So those that want really to have high stake in the situation, they can sign up and managing manage their own ecosystems. on level 3, there is the concept of registration authorities So this is optional. but open roaming brokers can deliver certificates themselves So they become, you know, the face to those INPs and IDPs that want to use their existing array or hub or ecosystem broker.

So I mentioned the 2 are poised and were standardized. So one is more focused on the settlement free, the other on the settlement. They both follow the same principles. It's just a decision on the business model. So right now, the settled is is something that is already available in one of the open roaming releases, but the free one is what is scaling more because if you think about flagship deployments like Tokyo. they are using this one where they are providing that service to the users. But, really, I think, you know, the RFC or the Internet draft goes into the details and provides real examples. What I would like to do today It's just to share that the the octants Of course, the first three optics are fixed. these are registered with IEEE. but then opted for and doctor 5, there is some flexibility to customize them. and apply these policies without, you know, waiting for technology"

I think this one is very important because of all the policies all over the world with GDPR, and others, but you can see that if you choose For instance, the 0, you would have the baseline ID policy where all the users will remain anonymous. But if you change to 1, you would have a permanent ID to be returned by the IDP. and this is where, you know, some companies might apply their business models. Of course, if an INP requires a permanent ID, I might lose, you know, some of the open roaming IDPs that are all is synonymous, but I think That's a very strong message from thepiration. that scale comes with this approach.

And those you know, learnings we had over these years since 2003, mentioned that it was really complicated to scale any rooming on a float with the existing models. So I can give you one example. Like, when when event like mobile or congress, where we have, you know, dozens of mobile operators that were around 70 codes. to configure on a wireless LAN controller because there was no other way to get off load from these parties.

So what is available to all the parties is you know, at easeencies approach. where if you try, agree terms with brokers, so not really the double BA. So, again, if you are working with the broker, you can chime. So these terms also can be added on top. and players that are are really willing to have a few more items. They can do it. and evolve this legal framework as the requirements come. All the IDPs that want these additional terms need to present them to the end user. So, again, privacy and policy becomes quite important with the legal framework. Then the final slide, it's also important to share the status of of open roaming.

But then we we have some some stability issues, and then we also wanted to limit to one IDP that's what we end up with. at the end, we didn't run the full experiment. This was just a a sandbox in your machine, but so far, I'm I'm I'm really happy to see that this is good enough to already show some some issues.

Yeah. today, I tried the single digits or pass point profile. The problem is, and Warren didn't touch on it exactly. It was I think if Bruno's president the naphtha record we weren't able to find out who would authenticate other other users or other IDPs. Yeah. So I think there's actually, like, in different script. So that's so, basically, you look up the IDP using, like, that to records and stuff. And the way that RadTech proxy does it is it calls a shell script to resolve them. you and I had tried to fix that by, like, fixing the radius con. there's a different shell script which automatically where the shell script itself is just like substitute pub in the middle of 3 t p p. And so I was like, that was really hell. That's really obvious. So if we can try that again later, We did try and connect -- We did try it. -- we did try and connect -- And it did give it access single digits using your AT and T identity and was like, nope. Go away. we can try it again. but but but but That's it. The the other thing I wanna bring up is in Yokohama, we tried this just to prove we could do it, and we we could. So from a knock standpoint, we're like, yeah, we did it. Eric authenticated with his Samsung device, not using the app, and that was great. and the meeting before that in London, we tried this and we had one user who got a profile from I think it was single digit and he was unable to remove it from his device. So we wanted to be very"

And that's why we as Juan Carlos said we tried we were gonna focus on the open roaming app as a as a means just to see what this would do. And actually touching on what Joe said, I listed these 3 GPP what country codes and mobile network codes. and Clemons and I were testing down in the lobby of the hotel. And when the elevator's open, we would get all of these people trying to connect to the device. and that's using their, like, SIM based Yep. Yep. Yep. and also a couple of people from Apple open roaming, Samsung open roaming, the bottom thing which is single digits But, I mean, it was a little surprising that as the elevators would open, we would see all of these identities And even if you we did do it that the access except thing would change. This is these identities are based on the sim, So those will always tie. The SIM in the phone, to the device. So doesn't matter if you change your MAC address every 30 seconds, You know? you're using this, it's always this device. your like, I I may see the Yoursim is gonna show up. So that kind of deanonymizers or the pool. maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully, they change. You can send me the change? Yep. Sorry, it's Mark. Just on that specific question, yeah, there's imsy privacy now added to the Ebix change. So it's now Hash So it will change. So well, so hang on. So -- It should be it should be changing with MZY privacy. Okay. So that So those hashes will that's a hash that changes. It's not just a hash and will stay the same. Sweet. Okay. Well, that helps. It's clements again. This time, I found my virtual finger. So a fee the problem seems to be implementation related. like I hear. Like, somebody just did not implement it. Right? But given the fact that this is"

This is real money if the implementation is bad. So how can we as the standardization buddy or whoever is involved how can we prevent that players from doing that implementations. And and then and then prevent them from rolling this out worldwide. I mean, I'll I'll point out that The anonymous thing, is not the default when I say anonymous. 8. AID an ID that's not your email. It's not the default. and openrooming, if you try and turn on the anonymous mode, it's like a bunch of networks won't connect you. So it's clear that, like, networks Do want. this sort of information. obviously, you know and that's true if you go to some captive portals as well, like, before you can join at many airports, they want your real ID. Because as you say, advertisers what the sort of information or they kill for it, Yep. So, I mean, I don't know if you can. It seems like this is kind of baked into part of the business model, at least, is You give us your information, and we give you the Internet. understand that it's a policy, but How do we think about enforcing the policy? Like, do we kick out bad players? And how does that work? or who who tests this? Who retests this? and to make sure that it that the standard remains to be followed, followed So this is Alan again. On on exactly that point, people have been doing this for well over a decade. You walk into retail stores. they will track you. It's not even advertise is where do you go in the store and what you do. It's absolutely been done for a decade. This is I I I would say partly as an implementer and spec author. is only partly"

Yeah. don't think the specs is anything about Yeah. I I don't think that the spec -- -- the stuff down. Yeah. I and the implication is that it's supposed to be a chargeable user ID that identifies the user and it doesn't say change it real fast, yo. But but you it it it implies that the intention was for that. but it doesn't say how to do it. And the result is people go, you know what? That's too hard. AS APPOSED TO. and here's how you do it, and here's why. Right. This is one thing which has changed in the last 5 or 6 years. in all the specs I review and write. you gotta write all that. I mean, it seems reasonable that you could say, for every time you send back an access, except you have to make up a new ID and you have track which user that ties to so that you can good good news is RadX has restarted, so you can throw more in there, and we'll get it fixed. Great. Thank you. Daniel? The reason I asked about testing multiple profiles is I was wondering if behavior has been observed with other IDPs because the Cisco Apple test you, I guess, with the Google IDP or with Apple. But then if you install the Tokyo 1, you now you're testing the Tokyo IDP. I'm wondering if all IDPs have the same CUI behavior, or, again, radius implementation that they've picked up, and that radius implementation shows us behavior, but there may be other identity providers that are doing the right thing. I mean, I believe we could test this without even having to install the profiles because we could just like, ship messages at the IDPs and being, like, hey. Yeah. There is a like, you don't even have to install the profile. We can just synthetically generate a radius request and be like, Will you let in this ID and see if they send back the same ID each time. I would assume that I would assume that they all reuse the same"

There we go. mean, the whole, like, This implies that you're expected to share and identity. But not every deployment. Remember, there's the PID. PID is used for this purpose. The PID says that if you need you need to give your identity for you to join this network, and that's a policy. And, well, for good or bad, that's the policy that I guess, WBA put in the arc definition. So some venues require the peer your your information in order to give you access, that's Now if you're finding misbehavior with that set or unset, then, actually, that's another problem. And finally, about the testing and stuff. I mean, the Something may be correct in the specification or maybe it needs to be worded different so people understand it. wondering who's doing the verification for the stuff. because it's one thing to put it in the spec. Another thing is who's gonna verify all these IDPs are doing the right thing. Yeah. And not gonna point fingers or maybe I am. Is WBA doing the testing to verify that these IDPs are doing the right thing? I I figure if you're gonna be an IDP for open roaming, need to go through some sort of checks and balances. So you should be tested. Yeah. I I don't think that anybody's violating a spec here because I don't think the specs is they'll shot, make up a new one. If that's the intent, it should probably say that. but That's -- So seem to Can can we let Bruno reply to that comment? Or Yeah. That'd be can you take it? So -- So is Bruno in the queue? Yeah. We closed the queue, but I he has a right to reply, and So, Bruno, do you wanna jump in? and respond to Daniel. No. We cannot hear you. You have to put your mic. Sorry. No. Very quickly. So yeah. Definitely. So the duration at at the high level know, there are policies in place."

You we can be a child disconnecting a party from operation. But I think you know, I just put here on the chat a few ideas where we could work with ITS because to be one honest, I think mission to Warren. I was impressed with the speeds he managed to set up an open roaming network. So as any fast evolving technology, you know, some players might do it fast, but not you know, going over all the bits and bytes of of the standard, but Warren was validated by a broker. Right? So these brokers, the signed agreements with the with the double BI. So there are SLAs, there are contracts, and it's illegal. you know, contract that they need to abide to. So if someone is not behaving according to the spec, or the standards. there is a legal you know, implication with with that. So that's the first player. The second layer, as I mentioned is because we control the PKI CA and policy ICA that is a revocation mechanism. where those IDPs or IMPs can be disconnected from the thresholds. So those processes are already in place. But maybe what I suggest is that on the plug fast to execute, Those coming new, and learning how to deploy and becoming brokers Wheat, we'll keep, you know, making those requirements even more strict based on the industry feedback. Thanks, Mark. Thank you very much. So we have 3 more minutes, and we would like to at least do a quick next steps So, Mark? Yes. So very quickly, in terms of PII, yes, the AMP is gonna see it. Warren showed you some terms about collecting PII the use of PII just from the open roaming legal framework. These are immutable terms. You can use PII to operate the service. to comply with applicable law and for troubleshooting. You can't sell lease rent that PII to a 3rd party. So just to be clear, yes, PII is observed."

So we have 2 more minutes, and I would like to to make sure that we have some next steps we won't have time to to decide and and and the the world in the in 2 minutes. but seems to me that this well, we we can give it a shot. Now seriously. We we I think it's worth continuing this discussion and and we don't need to wait until the next IETF. We can probably call a a a mid term intern meeting in about a month or something. where we continue the discussion and see after we have slept on this, discussions, what what is the best way forward to to solve these issues think it's it's it's great that we have all the systems expertise and views here. So the fact that we're collaborating makes it the best place I I believe at the moment, Madinas, to to reconvene, and then we have the experts from WBA 802 and IETFattending. So I guess, we can we can send it on the list, but with the intention to to call for an interim call in about a month. or so. Okay.
