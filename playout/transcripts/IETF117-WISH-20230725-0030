Luckily, we've not had any problems in this working group. So you know, things like having anti anti harassment policies and all that good stuff is is good good there for you to read. but we don't need to linger on it too much. Okay. So next, the meeting tips. Please do scan the QR code to make sure we get our appropriately sized room. Luckily, I think we're not really gonna have a problem with space. but feel free to do that. And it's also a way to do the key management for people that might be remote. Alright."

And then here's our basic agenda. some administrator which we're doing now that will give you a little quick status update on the web draft. And then we'll try to figure if we can do break some recharter discussion. And if we the people who did the Wisp thing, if they wanna talk, they can. I was super late getting back to them. So I don't know if they're actually here or not, so we'll see how that goes. So didn't really make any of the slides, just the kind of status update the for the whip draft. Sergio did some edits and did push out a 9 version and I've asked Marie to go ahead and start the IETF last call. And I know that Julia sent comments, like, immediately after I asked Murray to do this. So my hope is that we can just treat his comments as IATflastcallcomments. So we just kind of, like, get the process going. So that's that's kind of the quick status update. So that working the IETF last call should start sometime soon. And I'm hoping we can actually get the draft pushed to the ISG, you know, be done by September, basically, so it'll be up there. And, basically, the only thing that really have on the topic for the discussion today is this recharter discussion where we wanna work on the web. WEPWHEP draft, and we're kind of stuck And so we're at the point now where we've got a charter that things that people It looks like people are happy with, but we have one person who thinks we need to do a requirements draft. And so we're trying to figure out how to break that kind of deadlock. So I don't know if anybody and remote land wants to get in the queue and say anything. Nope. I'm not seeing anybody in the queue. I put some links there to the the actual chartered discussion that you can follow there. And, basically, the"

Why can't I see the slide? I don't know where is the slide. In any event, I can't get it to get there. Yeah. So fair enough. could share them. I don't know why I can't click on the link. So the we're we're basically stuck, and I don't know what to do. So there's 2 things we can do. Right? declare him in the rough, move on or just basically, like, overtly solicit input for someone to write a draft. And so I'm curious what we what what others think we should do. Harold. Huddl, all this junk. The purpose of the IETF is to make the Internet work better. What's publishing the web? grafts. is not helping the Internet work better. publishing it. will make the Internet work better, in my opinion. Waiting for a requirements draft does not help the Internet move forward. should move. Okay. Anybody else have any other opinions? Sertio. Sergio, Joe. Go ahead. Yeah. Hi. Hello, everyone. Also, I think that I mean, a I mean, I I think that there are 2 different discussion on its author chatting and and of the working. And if one is the by the commands, I"

I mean, the first make the chartered about the and the scope of the of the work, and then they have write a requirement. So I Well, I not sure if I agree that we need our requirement document or not. but I think that this would be a different discussion that yeah, about the being able to reach out to the they the group and be able to adapt the web rapfasa working group item. Yeah. I think just as an individual contributor, I I understand the the part that basically, the requirements draft could help us limit the scope. Right? I think the concern is that we might spend, like, a lot of time here if we We don't limit it. We don't limit it. on the other hand, I don't I don't see, like, many people, like volunteering here for We're actually writing such a draft. So I think just as an individual contributor, I would also say, like, we should probably move ahead and then be aware of the Like, if if we're losing interest in, like, even more features on web than and it's time to basically call it a day.

Well, I mean, I think we're gonna go ahead with that plan to just try to get the charter restarted Some of this search show has purely been the chair's fault because we dropped the ball.
