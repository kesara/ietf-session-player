    "text": "draft as well and this is primarily for IOT or constraint devices and first use case is you\u0027ve a constrained device talking to your home gateway to some kind of application running on your mobile phone and the data that you need to gather from that device is sensitive you do not want to share it with Gateway don\u0027t trust the gateway so you want to establish a encrypted channel between the client and the server and between multiple different transport links multiple different hops and the simplest way to do it is well we\u0027re proposing if the simplest way to do it is to exchange to get us records at the application area of the transport and establisher and encryption keys that way the second device is very sorry the second use get is very very similar give a constrained device that wants to connect by a gateway to the cloud the device doesn\u0027t the device does not trust to Gateway the crowd doesn\u0027t trust to get where you want to protect your application there from that gateway same solution um use TLS records to establish an encryption channel between your constrained device and the cloud service so when we\u0027re looking at this there\u0027s a couple of different ways you can do this but in the implementation options what I\u0027m showing here on the left is where we actually establish a full TLS session I keep the TLS session active for the entire the entire duration of data exchange and we send encrypted data inside the TLS session so every single encrypted data packet is sent as a record that obsolete means you need to worry about making sure that you\u0027re all the theatre\u0027s records get between the client and the server if you\u0027re using TLS you need to worry about am the reliability the transport layer or else you could use TLS and the second option is use key exporting and with the second option all your using TLS for the application there is two round-trip handshakes and clearly to establish a TLS session once you get the other section establish you use key exporting and then you\u0027re doing an application specifically at exchange using those exported keys next slide and this just shows the difference in what the data layering would look like between those two options the option on the Left shows your transport layer and there may be encryption taking place to the transport layer and on top the transport layer you\u0027re TLS record headers and your data is encrypted inside those two nodes records and on the right hand side with key exporting I\u0027m not showing the TLS handshake you\u0027re explicitly but assuming your TLS handshake has taken place then your encrypted application data which is encrypted using those exported keys is transported directly over the transport layer I think that was the best like then connect so with option one we were just carrying all of the data in TLS we recall that you tell us has a prerequisite a reliable in order data stream and I believe the draft was say "

    "text": "referring to using HTTP as potential transport that you might want to be using this was telling over on Patrick and Mark are in the room and can correct me if I say that you know HTTP by itself is not reliable in order transport layer there would need to be some work to go in to specify how to turn each one of these potential protocols you want to tunnel over into a reliable in order data stream and once you do that that\u0027s all the work you just literally run TLS because you have this stream that you can use whereas with the second option where you run just the TLS handshake and do ki exporters that\u0027s a little bit less complicated potentially and that you\u0027ll need to worry about in order and reliable for these first few messages but TLS itself does not really expect to give you where the message boundaries are in terms of you need to retransmit something what you retransmit and you know what\u0027s the ordering and then at the end of that and shake you just have these keys that you exported and now you have to specify some completely new protocol to do your actual data encryption here your data so it sort of seems like either way you\u0027re basically required to do a lot of work and specify a complete new protocol and it\u0027s not entirely clear to me from the presentation that this is the amount of work you expected to do going into it it seems like it might be more work than you\u0027re expecting to do so so first on the unreliable transport you could use TLS and send details records between the client and the server and on the on the key exporting okay if you want you could use TLS records and it makes the mix the reliability problem far far simpler because you only do have to worry about two round trips that makes specification of that retry make this really really trivial you don\u0027t need to ensure two packets get through unless they\u0027re large and I meant is it turns out in practice that if you know and I think it\u0027s implemented it\u0027s like when you look at what the things are that wants enemies request responses their flights from the client server that are clearly defining the stack gives you clear signals for when that\u0027s starting those things start and end because when it\u0027s done writing and so you have a pretty clear idea of what the chunks are that you\u0027re getting back and forth and their reliability properties are pretty clear "
