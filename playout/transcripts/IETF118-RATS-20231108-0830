The Corim Working Group meets regularly every Wednesday 4:4 PM in the European time And, there's a lot of brainstorm and a lot of activities and work which happens every week. So I'm going to give a brief update what has happened over the last, between ITF11711 So next slide, please. Yeah. So these are the kind of main points of the presentation where, we did tidy up, some of the editorial enhancements and then we'll talk about the alignment with that endorsement draft, which is published by Dave. Then we will explain the concept of Cobom and how we think it should be. It will be used followed by some tidy upon extensions, and then we added some more details on the verifier algorithm, which will go into detail. And The last bullet just mentions that how active we are, the plenty of contentious issues we resolved so 9 issues got resolved this, between last 3 months.

And, how if at all these needs, keys needs to be used for the target enrollment that got clarified and one of the important things we we added was, deauthorized by into the measurement map. So, basically, measurement map is kind of a struct, is a map which is used to express any reference values or endorsed values. So the reference value provider or an endorsed endorser supplies, encore him and commit the reference values and It is very important to mention the authority which can be different than the authority of the oral Kareem signer So, it's very important than that kind of a level of granularity on the on the triples on the endorsement those values and reference value, triple the authority needs to be added. So this this announcement went in into it in this cycle of the And then, we clarified some of the key terms on the appraisal procedure when we do the appraisal of evidence based on supply chain endorsements. Received from the, reference values and endorsement received from the supply chain. So very important discussions there will come in to that a little more detail in the next slide.

That calls the actual state and what we call reference values maps to the reference state And then the most important, thing is the conditionally endorsed values So, basically, conditional endorsed values are endorsements, Which which pertain to a target enrollment when it is when it matches reference values, given reference values. So evidence -uh comes in with the target enrollment and its reference values when that precise reference values match in the verifier, then certain endorsement apply So that matching condition is the requirement criteria, and that is the conditional endorsed values I think, that endorsement do talk about that. So there is some alignment going on there. And then there are identity endorsements as well. And Yeah. And so we simplified the appraisal procedures I think that that is going to be aligned with the that's end of So Yeah. Next slide, please. So Then we had a a detailed discussion about the concept called concise bill of material that has been more clarified and tidied up.

And the verifier may want to apply all of them together. Because, it cannot understand what what supply chain entities are correlated logically in 1 and should be applied in a verifier appraisal procedure So Cobham provides that mechanism where to means to activate a list of commit and cost with tag identifiers, and so we defined a concise bomb tax structure contains just a list of commit and cost with tag identities. And there is an associated bomb identifier known as bomb ID. And it is important to highlight that, the Kareem containing the Cobom doesn't need to have the, commit and cost with actual structures itself. They they can be supplied much prior before time from different actors, and Cobom is just a signal to the verifier to activate those listed tax in the co bomb at one point in time so that they can be applied during the a present procedure by the verifier. So we had a great great discussion about how, how the cobom should work. And so the we we currently have scale it down to requirement as no cobom if it's a very simple supply chain where maybe just one query is enough to supply all the commits and cosuits and then that signal itself is enough. So coupons may not be required, but likelihood is the use case point see where one co bomb is required where multiple actors, supply reference values to the verifier and 1 co bomb is issued by a designated authority like an integrator"

Sure. Questions now. Yes, Hannah. Yeah. Please go ahead. Yeah. I when I saw this slide, I was thinking about sort of the overall approach that the document takes. It, sort of the you have to verify and you want to provision reference values and endorsements into that verifier. And Normally, the verifier is not kind of a constrained device in any shape or form, it's like a regular web service And the easiest way you could do that is, like, you use Chase on and and get the stuff in there and you're done with it. However, you went off and defined everything in seaboard, which is I don't know, makes, makes it more complicated, but then you In on this slide, I wasn't quite sure anymore when you even work on a concise bill of material wouldn't is that Like, how do I can't I just use existing bill of material formats are not bothered with, coming up something new. Maybe I'm I'm missing something here. Maybe you can explain that So basically this is, this is for the activation because a verifier can get reference values and endorsed values for multiple, multiple appraisal contexts, right, because it it it cannot do it may not have the knowledge to distinguish what these corums apply to which context. So this is just a aiding tool for it to understand that, okay, it will keep all the commits and cosuites in in one side context. And once it receives a cobom, it applies those to that particular appraisal procedure. So that is that is the intent, basically."

So, why is this smaller, because the size and the amount of the data in it can be gargantuan. This is a and this is a true incident, analogy like with an s bomb, I knew s bombs. I have seen s bombs that are larger than 4 and 150 megabytes. But but that is nonsense. So with this reference values, and when you have these, endorsements and you have device compositions with, I wanna say, like, 17 types of, firmware potentially running on 5 types of hardware, allowing a furnace certain set of environment at this because this is a lot of permutation. It's also we keep size small because device complexity is not decreasing currently. So first reason. Second reasons is, simplicity of appraisal. There are attestation, evidence, formats, that are symmetric to corum. And when you have evidence, it's symmetric, you can do byte compare and super easy verifiers. That reduces the burden of appraised of evidence on the verifier, which potentially has to a phrase. A large number of devices began as scalability problem. So this is about the"

It is up to the verifiers appraisal policy as to whether wants to use cobom or not. It's a kind of a helpful tool or effectively, it is it is there to make the job of or the life of verifier easy because it it is doing appraisal of a number of different types of, attester which are supporting different types of attestation technologies So it will have different types of reference values, and this assist it to kind of make the context boundary easier.

I talked about the resolutions of them during the meeting, and so that been done. And so, the capitalization now of everything now matches the rats architecture documents, we clarified texture on claim sets, which was another one of his comments.

You don't wanna accept an endorsement about a target environment that doesn't correspond to that endorser. Right?

This is the one open issue that we kind of agree on the intent or whatever, but the text isn't in there yet Okay. And so attestation key material is very different from identity. At the time we had Hank and maybe Lawrence had volunteered to contribute text Hank's comment was, well, there might be such a thing as device identity everything else, we shouldn't use the term identity. So, in terms of alignment with Coram and so on, The expectation is we'll probably have a different section name and so on. Just we need contributions of text to do Okay. And because I said, I am not the best person to write that text but I am happy to accept contributions and hence, the call for volunteers this is the one pending item that is gonna look different by the time it's done. And so in my opinion, this is the one known issue that would prevent it from ever going to, like, working group call or anything like that. But we also had a discussion that says, should this block a call for adoption, and this was Lawrence's issue. And Lawrence said, no, it should not block a call for adoption.

I preempted you having to go up to the bike and repeat the same thing because we're actually on an agreement. So Yeah. Go ahead, Mohammed. So I don't I personally don't someone from. So I don't personally any issue in calling that an identity, but I think as long as we all agree that basically it's something. So I don't mind whatever name you use it. So The basic thing is that endorsement, the main thing is that verify needs a public key with which it can verify that a bunch of evidence which is coming, right, all the claims are signed and it needs somehow that public key with which it can verify And that's the most important of endorsement, and I would like to see it as a major part of the draft itself. I completely agree that it should not hold any adoption. It's major thing which was missing in the red architecture itself So I would basically call it a part of that document itself. But, I completely agree that it should be not hold up any, adoption that Thank you. I can, Text contributions greatly accepted. I don't plan on authoring the text for this one myself. But I'm happy to act as the editor when other people contribute text. I think there's agreement that there's conceptually 2 different types of things that may or may not use the word identity for it. At the end of the device, and then the key material of the endorser are both important concepts to walk through. So Okay. Okay. Next slide. Because this is the one technical open issue. Okay.

And and, and they pulled, you know, they, they proved out that they could attest all of the software fully up the stack, and they had it nested in the way that Dave's suggests.

So this looks more similar to Dave's, but, a more complex version, and this is the same slide I shared back at IETF 112. So you would do the claim set for firmware like, like, is currently done with the reference integrity measurements. But if you wanna package that up, and send it to share remotely to, a system that keeps track of the posture of an entire environment, you're just gonna wanna package up and a single statement. You're not going to wanna package up all of the logs that prove it out because that's just too much spam You can't do that for thousands of systems on the network and all of the individual software on a system, all of the operating systems, all of the firmware.

On the wire? Is, you know, is it a CIS benchmark? Is it just stig, what at the firmware operating system or application level that is grouped is is either meeting what the claim set wants or says, or how how it's being met by the claim set. And so that's the idea is just to get those standardized so that they can communicate to any posture management type systems. Currently, if you look at, like, Well, in a traditional so this maps really easily with a traditional environment If you look to a cloud native environment, there's all different product sets popping up. Ends, within those people are using SSH and other mechanisms to a short posture.

You can imagine sorts of ways where a CA might care where private key is stored in order to decide if it complies with a given certificate profile or not. So we this design team has already produced the I draft IETF lamps CSR attestation, which is moving along nicely. That just says if you have an attestation, here's how you carrier through a CSR, but makes no assumptions about what that attestation is. So now we also need an attestation format. And so under the cab forum, the code signing based on requirements that went into force last summer. Certificate subscribers look code signing certs need to prove to their CA that keys are stored in a FIP or common criteria certified module. Non exportable and sort of all the things you expect, there is currently no automated way to do that. So I can speak as a CA it's a it's a pain in the but we get, like, people taking cell phone photos of HSMs and thing like, look, here's an HSM. And I'm like, cool. You own an HSM. What does it have to do with this CSR or, like, the work, the one that we really hate is, our build infrastructure is in Amazon. We use KMS. So I don't know where the keys come from, and we're like, I is that Fipps. I didn't hear it. So that's what we're trying to solve here. We are aware that there exist a lot of ATCATION formats, out there already? Why do we need another one? None of the ones that exist meet our needs. Specifically, none of them are sort of steps or common criteria specific. So we think, you know, this work is being done. I mean, you just take this work somewhere. I almost could have taken this to sec dispatch because there's a dispatch question here. Is rats the right place this work. That's question number 1. So let me define, let me make on to next line and see what we're actually doing. So here's the technical content. We have taken each we have said we like the each claims. We don't like eat in coding.

I see Hank. I will take your question at the end. Then on top of each, so it's the each claims semantics, but, ASN1 encoding of them, and then we've added a few HSM specific things. So Fips conformance common criteria conformance, are the that are in there now. I think we need to add a few more, like, non exportable backupable card control, dual control. I think we can get all the HSM vendors probably with enough twisting of arms sort of agree on definitions for these things that are vendor neutral, although that seems to take many, many hours to get Dallas and Udi Maku to agree on a definition of anything. But this is this is sort of what we're trying to do. Eplusfips specific claims. My next slide, I think, is just an adoption question. Yeah, version 00, but it shows the direction. We do need to sync with TCG and Dice. I think there are some semantic need to be harmonized across these documents, and we've got that all sort lined up. We just haven't done it yet.

So is there something is is this level of abstraction so to say is sufficient to talk about at a station inside confidential computing use cases. And that's that's that that was That was our initial starting point. Where we had a look at rates because in the inside the a confidential computing consortium This is used as a standard terminology. And here on this slide, you see that basically there was STX breach which could actually get the attestation keys and use that in order to issue fake codes. So whatever you put it on tweet, it will issue you a legal a quote that will be verified by the verify it. So that that seems to indicate that this there is something inside, the architecture level details need to be incorporated and not only the high level picture of how does this communicate with the verifier And more recently, the solution which is called as TDX, which is at the VM based level of abstraction. The whole VM, is encrypted. And this is one, recent news, which is that Google Cloud, let enter so Google Cloud was allowed to access the Intel's resources and then they could found they could find the 10, major bugs inside that. So the approach that we have taken with this motivation, like how do we reason about this at the confidential computing level of, of the things They are very complicated mechanisms, and we need to reason about that. That's we can actually try to and these mechanisms that's at some level of abstraction,"

Why should we why should we actually have the verify and the relying party as in the and why not just have the architecturally defined attestation as we call it. Which is that we have the verifier here. We have the tester here, which is tester is running inside the cloud. And I want the guarantees that my data and cloud is protected at all time. And this is about confidential computing. So this attesting will generate an evidence verify signs and attestation challenge and, attested with generic evidence and it back to the verifier The very far will do the appraisal, and then it will send over some secret or sensitive data based on its use case, whichever it is dealing with, and and the generation of evidence, the appraisal of evidence the question in our mind was that why do we need to have the relying party here and what so so I will come to that. So so there were different questions in our mind. And we found this architecture to be sufficiently good in order to describe the basic capturely defined at the station. Once we know that we can replicate that for the relying party side. That's what the school framework is actually based on. So that's basically coming from there. So the overall idea of the whole thing basically is that we have now a bit of details added to this inside the so so think of this as the left side of the Rev's architecture. What we have identity supplier, Okay. I think this is better. Okay. So the idea basically is that it cannot the rats architecture cannot define the anonymous attestation for that, we added this identity supplier part which is another role which we have defined, and this is going to give"

So holistically covering the all the phases That is the provisioning attester and verify provisioning the initialization says where, the attester is required to do some setups, initialization steps in order to perform before it is ready for doing the actual attestation protocol And finally, we have this attestation protocol which is this between the attested and the verifier sending the challenge, sending back evidence and then doing the verification over that evidence. So this is the basic basic building block, which is required in order to understand the whole attestation architecture and we did not complicate it by having the relying party side. So once we understand this architecture in a formal way, then we can go ahead to the next stage, which is to the relying party and so on. So the contributions we made here was that it is the most detailed formal model of interddx attestation including the certificate chain right from the roots, root entity of intel up to the workload the steps of verifier, what is the procedure for the appraisal for the inter TDx case. Doing the, the steps starting from the doing the verification of the signatures checking the reference values, checking having that endorsements, and then checking that the all the endorsed values are also correct.

So the measurements in the formal model in the initial formal model that we had before were not variable. So we have now made it variable. So the second contribution is that we have a formal proof of insecurity of what interclaimed as the TCB for its, architecture And finally, we have for ArmCCA, which is the upcoming solution of Arm and this is interesting from a perspective that it is a composite attester as compared to the layer, the tester for inter TDX So we have for ARMCC as well. I will mostly cover only about tdX within the limited time, but, we we have a paper coming out, which is describing also the arm CCA So to describe it at a high level, I don't, I just put in this slide to to just to show you that there are a number of steps which are included But from last perspective, what is really important is that this local attestation is a necessary part as you see here in It's a finish that it is, it is an important part of remote attestation without local attestation, you can't really talk about without local attestation, you you can't really talk about remote attestation. It's it's it's it's really not possible. So so the rat's architecture says it's talking about remote attestation, but not about local attestation, That's why we include the evidence. We distinguish the local evidence versus the remote evidence which is distinguishing whether the attestation is going on at the level or at the remote level. Yeah. So so these are all the steps.

And it's not really easy to navigate through the documentation because there are a number of issues within these documentations. Many things are quite vague. It's not clear what that is meant to be inside the specifications. This is really one example which is showing that, And we do, we all know that that these designs are very complicated. So the specification, for instance, the SVMs basically actually represent, The typical way to check that is that it's greater than equal to comparison. Inside one of the specs which Intel had was this that there is an equality check which was Really unclear why this equality check is there. So what we did was we we posted it here inside the forum.

It says that all the data that is including the identity elements remain the same freshness that the freshness is guaranteed and the confidentiality of the attestation relatedties is maintained attester authentication is one important property that I can ensure that it's really the entity that I want to talk with So I have, like this slide to show the results of what of what we have this is on the left what interclaimed as its PCB, which does not include the PCE and it also says specifically all other software is not interested by the trust domain. What we did was we basically have this certificate chain completed, right from the a root CA up to the trust domain, which is the VM protected confidential VM. And corresponding to that, if there is a certificate here, Okay. So so this this is the, basically, the result of the verification, what we say is that, basically, all the properties that I described, integrity freshness, confidentiality, and do not hold for the entire claim TCB. And by including the PC, which is one of the entities inside that We we have the first three properties, but authentication still does not hold for remote attestation. And there is an interesting point there. So the adversing in the confidential computing model, can actually instantiate a replica of the uncliff or the trust domain in this case And at the very far side, you cannot without additional properties or, protections. You cannot actually identify which attester you are talking to. So that's one of the one of the use cases inside the Kubernetes. It's difficult to actually identify that.

So this is one open question. For instance, how do I verify the verifier inside the red architecture? 1 claim which is given is that, okay, so the relying party has, so small, minimal, very fire inside that. But the point is that if it has that verify inside. Why does it need the verifier? So why does it direct that doesn't it directly just check that? So this is This is one open question, which is, which we want threats to focus on or to have a solution to how to verify the runtime configurations. We we we that the attestation guarantees are only for the initial time. So so it's in the confidential computing use case. For the initial boot time, load time guarantees are there so that all the claims are related to but there is no runtime configuration. So how do we verify at the runtime? Yeah. And thirdly, as I said, the rats architecture compared to the split architecture is what I propose I describe here how is the rats architecture actually better? So, what are the scientific let's say, justification for having threats architecture, how is it better than having a split architecture? This is what we are exploring, and would be nice to have the rats, feedback on this. And Mohammed, we need you to wrap it up pretty quick. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm on the, just the last sentence maybe.
