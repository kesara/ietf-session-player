    "text": "this be adapted to gossip networks that might be an interesting question okay kind of another topic is that applies particularly to these gossip networks is how do you actually you know how do you cut down on the amount of redundant traffic and one thing that happens a lot of blockchains is you you\u0027re kind of flooding transactions out there and so everybody has a bunch of transactions and what you really want is for everyone to end up with the same set of transactions and ideally you don\u0027t want have to send multiple copies of that transaction so so in these kinds of situations what comes in really handy is if you have an efficient way to do set reconciliation and so kind of so there\u0027s kind of obvious ways of doing it using hash trees to to you know compare which parts are different but that doesn\u0027t work if the differences are all over the place or error correcting codes if there\u0027s small differences but about well I guess like eight years ago now there\u0027s a really neat way to do this that we\u0027re actually the amount of network traffic that you send is only proportional to the difference in the size of the sets and that is the idea was that you use these things called invertible bloom filters where instead of just a bunch of bits you keep counters that if you set a bit multiple times you keep the counter and so what you can do is you can basically take two invertible bloom filters and kind of subtract one from the other to see which and then that creates a new bloom filter for just the things that are different between the two sets and the other you need one more trick which is you need to kind of estimate the size the difference but you can do that by doing kind of like log many log many bloom filters so this is a pretty cool idea which might come in handy in these systems and then finally of course since like at least my interest in doing this is to get a good multicast layer underneath SCP this question of should we be leveraging some of what some of the kind of trusts decisions that people are already making for SCP and just to remind people the way SCP works is that it formed quorums in a decentralized way by individual nodes picking these quorum slices who are the set of people that they don\u0027t want to be partitioned from basically the people they want to stay in sync with and then SCP makes sure that that applies transitively so every node and SCP takes a set of form slices QV and and and then a quorum is defined as a set that contains a quorum slice of every one of its members right so so one question is could you maybe subscribe only to the sender\u0027s that you actually care about have multicast groups or maybe not even a multicast group but some way for you to hear only about the people that you care about but you need to care about people transitively like if I say you know I\u0027m only gonna agree to something if Dirk doesn\u0027t he\u0027ll only of grief Melinda does then like I kind of depend on her I need to get her signatures the other thing is can you maybe leverage the trust that people are expressing in their choice of quorum "
