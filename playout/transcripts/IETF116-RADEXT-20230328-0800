Just to so that everybody know the red group technically moved from Ops to sec. Area? Yeah. We just discussed this with the eighties internally. And since for planning reasons is for scheduling. It's easier if it's in insect because There's is sec chair anyway handling it. They they decided to just move it.

Between what was presented at the last meeting and on the list and The actual approved charter, I think most of those were broadcast on the list we'll just go through the charter quickly. So everyone knows where we are. The radius extension working group is gonna focus on extensions to radius This is all exactly the same as it was the first time we Any non backwards compatibility changes need to be justified.

So what we have here are d deprecating the use of secure transports bringing sixty six fourteen and seventy three sixty to the standard track those will probably happen at the same time. Defining best practices to use tls P with radius, defining best practices for radius roaming, and Roaming could Sorta based on experience with radius Tls, improving operations, for multi hop radius networks extending the eight bit radius Id a allowing for Coa and disconnect packets to be sent in reverse... In the reverse direction, and defining A extensions for radius t. And it should I think say and radius D even though it does not. Which allow using of those transports for Phi compliant networks. And so those are the work items that we have And we're trying to complete most of this work by twenty twenty four because we wanna be part of the Wifi Eight release So we have a fairly short time frame for doing this work.

Which are now in the operator name I believe. But there is a draft on normal Coa o proxy it's basically using the same thing. And then when you're in your local network, how do you get it to the Nas? Your radio server somehow knows how to get it to the nas. So we're not standardizing the proxy decisions. We're trying to standardize just that it is done and how it is done. Hopefully, there isn't a lot of controversy. So, yeah, we'll go through the slides. That's the introduction. Next slide. Yeah. So this is effectively what I what I said, There is some interest in using this in Roaming federation. So open roaming now uses Ip or D depending. If you use Ip ips sack, you have a network you can send c packets. If you use Tls. You can't. And so when you're billing people, it would be nice for the home network to reach out to the visited network and say, please disconnect this user.

So there's no other changes to the attribute encoding. We go to the next slide, proxies do not decode or interpret chop. So if you wanna do chap, great, if you wanna do M ms chat, great. None of the proxies no. No proxies care. Home servers can still do whatever they want. But avoiding Md five for the client to serve Tls transports mean that the sessions can still transport m five data the home server can still do M five hash just the proxies can now be fixed compatible. Which it was impossible before. Next slide. So we've repurposed the authenticator field a thirty two bit request reply token, to allow two to the thirty two packets on the same connection, flags these flags were added sort of at the last minute as I was putting the last draft out. Alex had some good comments on the mailing list. The idea with the flags is we have unused bits in the header we might as well do something with them. And the ideal would be to allow signaling to the client or the server that the packet being received was sent over secure. So if there's a hop in the middle, which is Udp,"

Unfortunately, this is on a request reply basis per packet basis. A little more difficult to do it per realm per user whatever. So running away from that problem is likely best. Next slide.

Otherwise, it's it doesn't hurt to know that your packets have been encrypted. Questions. Hi, Jan D. We already had a short discussion about the flags.

I'm trying to proxy to some domain. I'm trying to send packets to some domain, how do I notice set the flags? And I think the answer to that is really implementation magic, we can put the flag in, and we can say somehow, your outbound proxy talks to that realm and knows that that realm has made a statement. To set this flag But if you don't have the flag, you can't use it. If you do have the flag, somehow magically, it can be sad.

So it's good to have a document saying, here's how to use it. And the issue especially some of what some of the room people have been running into. Certificates are hard. Right? It can be hard to get certificates. You have to lie to the C and tell them you're using web certificate kits and then put the in your radio system and some people think that's bad. You know, certificates last for a while and it's hard to know when to renew them or who to renew them? And who has the responsibility in your organization to renew them? As opposed to P. Next slide. So the one main change from using a shared secret is you need an identity and it's just an identity of the Nas, Josh Hall, and I have been having some conversations on the list as to whether or not every Nas as a radius client should have its own identity or whether those can be shared. I think it's safer to say you shouldn't share them. Josh has reasons why you should I don't have strong opinions there. That's more of a security operations"

    "text": "Carter who gave us some feedback on the list, excellent editorial and clarity suggestions, there were a couple of Technical issues raised, most of which were resolved on the list and the basic functionality for this is implemented in free radius the status round is implemented by Alan, the loop prevention we implemented in free radio sub configuration. Actually. So next slide. There were couple of things that can come up One was a suggestion to add a timestamp to the status realm responses would require a definition high resolution timestamp because the radius data is in seconds, and that wouldn't be very useful. It might offer some visibility, but the discussion on the list kind invented with Clock queue was likely to make it Not all that useful. And So the question should we add one or not? I think the authors based on the end of the discussion on the list of thinking No. But if anybody wanted to jump up and say yes, this would be a good time to do that. And then the other one was that we wanna implement this and experiment with it. And to do that, we need a type code. A packet type code for radius. There's an Diana registry that's Is approval, which means if the working group asks paul and Paul agrees. He can tell I am, and we can get a number. It's not like for densely populated field. So we're hoping we can get a number for this to experiment with it. And we're suggesting thirty five because that's the next unused code. All, the there's a clarification. I see approval does not mean I can do Means the I can do that. And I'm only one sixteenth of the Ie g. So Okay. I... Because I you talk to her and that's... They said you could do it."

    "text": "So we'll we'll have to clarify that with, but It it is... I I recall it is weird because it says approval, but then there's another one for published document. So it's... I don't know. We'll figure out whether... I mean, either it would be you approve or you would take it to a intelligent chat but we need to ask you first. And so I guess I'd be interested to knowing if anyone objects to us asking for a packet type code for this Next slide? This document was the source of the working group work item that appears in our charter. For exactly these things. So I'm hoping if people read it, we can a adopt as working work item for that for that item. How many people who have read the document? Yeah. That would be, like my c and one other guy. So We're gonna get people to read all of these documents obviously. I think there's no other One of people to draft. slide. Okay. So there were as many as three. But So we've got a we've got it once again get people to read these documents. Anyone have any comments on the two question? Can you go to the previous slide? If anyone has any comments on these things or anything else? I think that I think Alexandra. Two Yes the timestamp stamp, I think Alan flagged them and that could just look at the delta as it popped back through the server. Is he correct and you can't get asymmetric and Radius, So everything goes back along the same path, So maybe you could be just a luckily bypass because it it's a dealt from the same boat. It'd be nice to see it and at least you'll get what the layers from that hop all the way to the end back end. And that might be useful. You can probably infer other things from that."

    "text": "Happy to help wherever I can there. Yeah. I mean, that... I that could work. I I don't object to doing the work the question is just, you know, would it be useful. So if you think that would be useful, we can we can... We have to have the new data type, which is some probably middle a second or sub second granularity in order for it to be interesting because the round trips are not that Long. And there'll be some spencer. That's what you're using up above it and stuff how long they are, but they're not it won't be interesting in seconds. Yeah. This is Alan. Honestly, was just call it an integer and describe it as, you know, delta in milliseconds or some it'll it'll be good enough. Well we'll have to figure out the details, but we'll we'll work on that. Any other huge humans? No. We. Right. What's up next? Next presentation. Yes. Is that alan? I think it's a bit Id. Yes. This one was originally requested or came from the Rad group before I got shut down next slide. It really is eight bits or not enough. We're not nineteen eighty nine, nineteen ninety one anymore. Using more source ports causes a problem this been highlighted as a problem for a decade now. Nobody has a solution. My idea was we have a sixteen byte unique Id global unique temporarily unique. Just use it. Right. Why not."

    "text": "Turns out some of the A stock is a lot easier to implement. One to do Tls, So the question is, do you want to dump this and just say Tls and say legacy radius is dead and garbage. Because the hard part about this, I think if we go to the next slide, talks about this. The hard part is is is really the negotiation. Which is doing normal radius, at some point we'd like to use more than eight bits of packets per connection. You have to negotiate that, which means tracking packets the old way and the new way the same time, which is a nightmare. There's pages of text in the document. About how to do this. There is some implementations which have been done there are minor changes to attributes if you're using the request authenticator as an Id you have to have an attribute in the reply which contains that request authenticator that lets you match up request and reply. Next slide. Yeah. So If we get rid of negotiation, this is actually relatively straightforward. You just go set a flag on client server, They now track based on request authenticator instead of Id, everything simple. If you want to do negotiation, it's a horrible pain and I'd almost be inclined to just throw this out and tell everyone. It's twenty twenty three use tls and A. Because that just has a thirty two bed Id and it's easy."

    "text": "So this is one of these need to solve the problem. Do we solve it this way or do we just solve it a more complicated way which may be better long term. I don't know. I'll be happy to have one last document. That's a hint. Questions. I have a question and a comment I'll the comment first, which is, yes, it would be nice to have one less document would rather we didn't define an entire mechanism for this when we're trying to replace this. But also this applies I guess the Document too in a sense. Why what what is the preference for doing the thirty two bit value rather than the forty eight bit value of of both the Id. Yes. The issue with using the Id is you have to track not just the Id, but the packet type. So the eight bit Id space is actually per packet type which makes implementations much more complicated. And causes problems for things like protocol air, you want to be able to say I have an error with a packet you sent me, but now you have to say what kind of packet. And if you just throw away the Id and have some token which is globally unique per packet. Than a lot of the implementation just becomes a lot easier. Thank you. I I had forgotten about that. I think out. There there's a lot of trauma there with historical garbage. blocked Pluto again. I would approved watching having this document gotten rid of because the Stuff is just clean up"

    "text": "makes more sense and also is a bit of a carrot to say people over to it maybe seems to be all better on that side of the fence. Thanks. Speaking. I would also suggest just leaving it along the way. I've just I'm I'm not sure if there are some security considerations in that document already because the request authenticator also used for the ob application of the attributes. So maybe there is some security consideration if we then Or if Nasa's think it's a good idea to just count that counter the request authenticator up So So if we do go down this path, there's pages of text in this document as to why it works. And it doesn't change anything on the client side. Other than tracking the request authenticator instead of the Id. But all of the practices of generating a request authenticator signing the packets, everything it's exactly the same. It doesn't change anything. So that's at least somewhat reasonable there. But Yes. After doing the A and then coming back and looking at this. I think I started bleeding out my ears and decided it was it was pretty crazy. But Yep. Okay. So do we have some of And either the ra people here who would like we do have one minute left if they wanna come up and talk about the document asked to talk about if time allowed. Okay. Well we'll in the agenda, if you read it and provide the feedback hopefully, they will appreciate that. Oh, I guess Mark Grayson. Yeah. I guess we we've run out of time market, but thanks.

    "text": "Yes. Just just maybe very quickly, we see Bluetooth evolving from a point to point connection to be more network wide with silicon selected manufacturers, having sort of virtual mac addresses and and delivering, I guess, mobility to Bluetooth. And therefore, we think there's an opportunity to use radius to enhance multi vendor multi domain aspects of Bluetooth roaming. So my understanding is what you're looking for is feedback from people who understand radius. That's correct Group. Okay. And the documents up on the screen here now. Draft grayson Rad rattled, so people, people can find that and hopefully provide feedback on it. Thank you very much. So some much for ro who participated, it was very tough. Agenda, and we managed to just bear And hopefully, the next time time will session slot, and will be discuss more items. So thank you very much and I coverage to participate on the discussion with moment this. Thank you."
