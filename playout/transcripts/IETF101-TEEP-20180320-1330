Minnis I would just say you take concur some earlier comment anima say for human devices the IOT and they can choose different from a more resource rich at the Wyss right like a phone sensitive our power because they have a lot of tools and elaborated through the GSI HTTP just use that it\u0027s more efficient for that in your wire net then you have a certain more arty device and even more recent country and then just get to the coop and a seaport maybe that\u0027s still is it the the wires only pick one by the time right you can support us I think that will be more feed impose i\u0027ve support more optimal in both environments okay so the option since they are interdependent what I\u0027m hearing is and will take it all in in the mail to is to offer the notion of having the Tam support multiple right but the client only has to support one I think what\u0027s the most important for this protocol is to be sure that we can represent the interest of IOT even though other can have additional more rich way of messaging so I think that we need to use at least two okay so what I\u0027m also hearing strongly in the group is that we should I\u0027ll say sure that the multiple is the only option you have because you know I\u0027m pretty sure that I ot have some limitations while the others may not and you don\u0027t want to limit the others and that\u0027s a fair point yes scrolling back this was who was that you are a line oh it\u0027s Hank ok um Hank says first +1 - max - co-op and Seaborg that make sense he says co-op over reliable should be discussed more and that was it ok so I think we\u0027re hearing rough consensus but well we\u0027ll take it all through the mail ok so now the question is given that we were late and submitting and Ming ok is over there how many have actually rule read a draft open any version of the draft these four or five six yeah okay okay so so let me ask the question here Brian you can put your hand down now thank you um should the group adopt the draft as our starting working group draft for the solution "

    "text": "should we do a hum can we get along our Charter says it will have a good relationship with global platform so we could also say the presumption is that we will and ask for objection so I if people think that there are objections and we should be discussing that question so Dave Kemp um I would phrase that question is if we were going to align with suit and use an information model then the one alternative would be to take the data structures in this draft raise them up to an information model and then use that as the starting point versus using the JSON message format specifically but the draft has more than that yeah right the draft specifies the whole flow right but since this draft has already been worked on in global platform and has some implementations in that context we understand right if we\u0027re going to do something we need to choose to say we\u0027re going to use that as a starting point or AG or our own way and do something different and so this is should we adopt that and innovate from there and do everything that we\u0027re talking about and any changes or additions based on that or not is if it\u0027s going to start from someplace else that\u0027s a bigger discussion so if you\u0027re gonna argue that no we want to actually hear about that and hear why Dave volts Brian I was just gonna suggest that you might defer on the information model question anyway until you figure out if you\u0027re gonna have a single data model implementation or yeah yep so what I\u0027m hearing is maybe the word V is a little bit confusing here because it doesn\u0027t mean that the document organization forever will be exactly one document we have to factor okay so I rephrase it to strike the the as a working group correct yeah yeah Bret Jordan yeah I would concur with that as well and I second what Dave said that I think this is actually a great place to start so okay so let me be asked should the group adopt that this draft this draft as a working group item can I get a hum please okay and who believes we should not be adopting this as a working with that come please Wow III think we have consensus okay I just wanted to relay a couple of comments from the room and now I\u0027ve lost names again one is and I\u0027ll get back to names because I have to scroll up further I\u0027m okay with the draft as a starting point but some larger issues must be addressed for instance secure boot definition yeah yeah and then starting with draft six will ease compatibility with the work at "
