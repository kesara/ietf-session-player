    "text": "so anybody who wants to prop up an authority token service could do so you\u0027ll be able to create a job and you know basically have use this to prove to the ultimate authority token that that you deserve to be able to get or certificate for particular identifier we created a typing mechanism for that and this really short range this is what a challenge this might look like for this this this particular type of a touken here we have the token type defined as ATC which is the version we use for jobs and that\u0027s all that\u0027s in the first one of these drafts and that Draft has not changed a terrific amount in this particular revision but we have a registry for those types that so people undefined other types for it they could to use things other than jaw that\u0027s all in there is amazingly short range so then we did go ahead and define a way to do this that is specific to the telephone number option for this and Chris can talk probably a bit about that and what we\u0027ve done with it but at the end of the day really where we are with this as for this revision we just did some editorial fixes we updated the examples so that they actually conform with the latest version of Acme and the changes that were made in that we put in some errata that had come through from from addis i don\u0027t you want to talk a bit about what changes you made yeah the only thing I wanted the only thing I wanted to mention there was over in the IP n and I that\u0027s the service provider specific industry group that\u0027s using stir we\u0027ve put that into our documents shaken and reviewed it over there so you know first what I thought to try it on this yeah and we\u0027ve been kind of slow slow rolling it a little bit until we made sure that the people over at us were comfortable with this precisely because we\u0027re trying to get buy-in from pretty large service provider community that is not necessarily familiar with the typical vocabulary of how we would do things for approving things for DNS names and so on so it\u0027s important that we keep that on board in terms of what we still have to do I don\u0027t think this is ready for last call or review probably at this stage we we do want to patch in and we\u0027re just gonna shamelessly steal this from what the people are doing in at us the restful interfaces are actually using for token acquisitions we don\u0027t have anything for that now in the main authority token draft are in in our inclination that though is not to actually make it like this is the mandatory way to do it but instead to have that be an example and if people want to use something other than this restful interface that\u0027ll be fine but we will at least define one way of doing this in the base specification or at the betoken we have a ton of housekeeping still to do in both drafts though like adding seconds to the the TN off less draft so I think probably we do one more wrap of this it should be ready for review and hopefully for last call there\u0027s really not much to it I guess so "
