    "text": "I just wanna sort of thank you all for for coming early and sacrificing your weekend to write some code related to various protocols and proposals for protocols. This has really sort of become a very important part of the meeting arguably for some the most important part because we can actually work on things then run rather than write on talk by documents that somebody else has to write the code for. So I hope you enjoyed the meeting. I hope you also had a good night. I slept very well, which surprised to hell other given that I'm coming from flying East, which is usually not good. And it's always good to be back in Japan. It's been very long time since we've been here. It feels like But It systems here work really well. So my a card. I don't even know how old that is, maybe twenty years. I brought it with me, and it it recognized it and it told me I, like five thousand yen left on it, which is a nice surprise. So all the vending machines are now available to me. But enjoy your day, write some code, Charles is gonna talk to you more about the logistics of it. I will mention that we have to wear these things while we're in this room and while I'm also from a country where lots of the restriction have been lifted and I haven't been wearing one of these since London. I'm gonna wear one this week because this is what we do here. So enjoy your day, enjoy the the coding and and talk to people, meet new people. And what with the? Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you for opening things up for us Lars. And yeah. I'm I'm Charles Ec. I'm one of the the c chairs of the Hack. Very happy to be here and welcome to all of you My other c chairs ben here are front with me. Barry is I saw he's in the back of the room there berries here as well. I'm gonna cover some stuff about the Hack, but if there's at any point, you need you have a question. You need help with anything."

    "text": "You can come find one of us and and and will help you whether it's something we we covered or not. So as Lars mentioned, very important to wear masks when you're not up here speaking or what are actively eating that's an agreement we made for for this I ihs meeting. Especially because we have a mix of people who have been traveling a lot and those who maybe haven't been and and are coming from different areas with more restrictions. So please do just wear your masks Jay is here. He he'll be going around with extra masks in case and and reminding you to wear masks give you one if you if you don't have one, if Jay comes in pays you a visit, he's he's in the back there. Please, put you know, be sure to wear your mask. Or or grab one from him if you need it. So first of all, I wanted to see I always asked this the beginning of a hack how many of you this is your first time coming here to one of these? Okay. Wow. Fantastic. That's that's great. I'm each time I'm always a little nervous that there aren't gonna be, like, like, new people, but each time I'm really happy to see how many new people there. There are here. May hard to see, but I'm actually wearing a t shirt from that back on when we were here before, I f ninety four. I was about seven years ago, I think. And we were in the the old part of this conference center and we had maybe seventy people. So It's it's nice to see the growth. Then also another thing I I think is really interesting is for how many of you this is your first experience really with the Ihs. Okay. So we have a few of You and Yes. That's also super important. And I think"

    "text": "I certainly feel this is a good way to introduce yourself to the Etf to get started with it. Don't be hesitant to, you know, reach out, meet new people I know you're gonna be anxious to dig into your project. Also find out a bit what's going on with the other projects and the other people in the room. I'm sure they'll be happy to to chat with you and get to know you as well. So take advantage of this opportunity, And and hopefully, you're also going to stay for the rest of the meeting week. And you'll get even more out of it that way. When you see how what you do here during the Hack how that gets reflected in in the working group sessions that that happened throughout the week. And then just one more thing. This has a little bit of to do with the mask. How many of this is your first time being out at, like, and in person event like this. Since since the pandemic. Okay. Almost almost zero. So that has changed dramatically in the last two years. And I guess that's actually a good thing to see. So so happy to see that as well. We can get rid of that question. Okay. So why we're here? Hopefully, you already know this and this is part the big reason of why you are here. It it's really to speed up and enhance everything all the great work we do here in the. To to implement the working group drafts and the Rf that that we're standardizing here and we're possible to use that to feed that back into the work we're doing to prove it to have it go faster. With the idea being that we wanna you know, reach a a a better standard faster with actually some running code to back it up. That then know can be used to jump start implementations and so adding support of those standards. And then another big thing of course, as I mentioned, was getting to know each other, bringing new people to the It and really building your own personal network. That's going to help you be successful in the And and hopefully have a really good and educational time in the idea."

    "text": "So everything we do at the kind of falls under this this note well So has to do it, you should make sure you're familiar with it, so you know the Ip pal policies, they they come into play when you're in a working group session, they also come into play when you're here. And to the contributions you make during the hack. Now the code that you work on it likely has other implications related to it and other conditions. So there, you have to make sure you're aware of the license of that code. And that you're using it appropriately and that you're following the any added restrictions that are there in the code. Because the code that you work on is actually under those requirements. So so be sure you're aware of the code you're working on. If it doesn't have a license, and you're the team working on that code you may wanna talk with your your legal team or or with someone else to see about getting a license on there. Because then otherwise, you know, people really don't have the right to contribute to it. So please make sure you take care of that as well. Okay. Now the more fun part. All the projects that we have. We have a great list of projects They're all on the wiki, if you haven't taken a look at this yet, I saw there were about thirty projects last I checked. Take a look. It seems like most of you have already kind found a table and have a place where you wanna work If you haven't don't worry, there'll be plenty of time to find a good group to work with. If you're having a tough time, one resource you can look at is we do have a lot and found page on the wiki. And so you can add yourself to there put a little bit about the things that you like to work on, the skills you can contribute. Also, if you're leading a project and you have a need for people with a certain skill set, put that up there too so that we can kind of help match people to projects."

    "startTime": "00:10:00",
    "text": "Hopefully, this will be a good resource that helps you out a little bit. Okay. The agenda. So we're at this kickoff and And and then after this, really, the goal is to make that everyone finds a team if using the but lost and found and that is not working out for you. You can come in and see me, see one of my c chairs know a lot of the projects here and the people. So, you know, we're happy to help you as well. We're going to have lunch brought in here. So we encourage and welcome you to stay here through the lunch and continue working on your projects. Of course, if you prefer to go out, you know, that that's up to you too. Just try to make it easier for you to stay here. Assuming you want to stay here. In the afternoon, we'll have some snacks brought in and then we will have dinner brought in as well. So it'd be really great if you could you could stay here for that. Now one thing that's a little bit different this year is We usually run the Hack on a little bit later into the evening, but this whole conference center shuts down and we need to be out of it by nine Pm. So we really need to be out of this room then at eight thirty to make sure that we completely clear the premises. I know many of you like to stay a little bit, you know, push that limit of staying to the the very end. This time, we really can't do that. We need to be here completely out of the facility bought by nine Pm. So if if you're here near the end, please please help us out. Please help me out. So that we, you know, we adhere to this policy. Okay. Then on Sunday, we'll be back here again. Breakfast will be in the back like it was. Lunch will be provided again the thing I wanna call out is that We do like to share the results of what we've worked on in the in the hack. And that starts at two Pm. So really around one thirty My our suggestion is that you You stop"

    "startTime": "00:12:04",
    "text": "plan to stop working on your projects for the most part. And then pull together a presentation if you haven't already. So that you can be ready to share what you did with everyone else who's here. And with some people who aren't here and they're just watching because that's that's something we found that really the Ihs community finds very useful. Is to see what what you've done here what you've learned. Especially those things that might have an impact on their work group. And then by four Pm, we're going to wrap up here so that many of you who I saw our newcomers to the you'll have time to get to the the newcomer events and everyone can go to the opening reception and all of that. Any questions about the agenda? Or anything else I've covered so far? Okay. So gather gather as a tool that we started using during the pandemic and continue to use to help people especially those who are remote to interact with with those people. Other people are remote or who are online. We are using it again for the Hack on. I've seen a couple groups have already started using it you'll see there's... To get to the Hack specific area just follow the arrows. That that are on the screen here when you log in to together, you'll you'll be brought to this initial page. Then you can just follow those arrows and they'll bring you into a the Hack space. Which kinda looks a little bit like like here. Especially a little bit more than usual maybe at this meeting. So there's a number of cables there. If you'd like, your team can pick a table and then you can encourage others who are either here or especially those who have remote to come sit at that table to interact with you there using the whiteboard and and note pads that are there are just entering into an audio or video conference with you at that space."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:14:02",
    "text": "So we're looking to see... Especially with gather how many people actually use it at this Etf because this is a tool that we've been sort of using on a bit of a trial basis. And if it's really useful, we'll continue to use for the Hack. If it's not, then we might not. So give it a try if this is something that's useful for you, let us know. And and will help us make that decision. Then Hack net. This is another great resource that's available to everyone here. This enables people who are not physically at the It meeting to join the I ihs network, So you'll be able to work with people in that way as well you actually be able to be on the same network. We also use it if you have any special networking requirements. So especially because we're working on network protocols and and and internet standards here if you're developing something that requires sort of special media an All two network or something like that. We can help set that up for you. So if your project has special networking requirements, let us know there's some instructions here about how to get it set up. And the no team will work with us to provide anything that's within their capabilities. Oh, one other thing I should mention if any of you brought in access points that you plan to plug in and and use as part of your projects. Okay. I don't see anyone. Well if you do, you can see that Hey, what's going on here? The slides aren't keeping up Interesting Okay. There is you you're supposed to use a channel thirty six only and no greater than twenty megahertz channels. And that's if you're on the five gigahertz spectrum. If you're two point four gigahertz,"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:16:01",
    "text": "you can kinda do whatever you want. So anyone who does decide to plug in a a wireless access point, make sure you you follow these rules. So that you don't interfere with with any of the It ihs network. That's running in this room. Okay. I mentioned these results presentations, we'll be doing them tomorrow afternoon. I'm we always have a lot of presentations, which is great. We need to keep them short so that we finish in time. So for those of you who will be presenting keep in mind that we wanna keep those two to three minutes or less. And what we'll run a timer. So these are just quick overview of what you did. What it was the problem you were trying to address what you achieved and the things you learn. So keep it very high level. And just enough to let people know what you did, so that then later on, they can ask you more about your project and have those more in debt conversations. If when you have your project presentation, what you need to do is you need to upload it into Github. So what we have is we have an Etf hack org in Github. And with there, if you'll find a lot of the code that people work on on the Hack, if you need a repo to hold hold the code that you're working on, let us know we can create one for you there. We have a special repo that we've created I and sixteen project Presentations. And that's specifically for this iteration of the hack And this is where you will be uploading your presentations that you're going to give tomorrow. If you take a look in that repo, there's a few files there already. There is a a read me then there's a couple of templates one template a Powerpoint template, the other one is an Html template. And you can use that to help you get started with your presentation."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:18:01",
    "text": "And just kinda follow the formatting that it has there. And the the things that it asked you to cover. Most people find that that pretty handy. One thing I will say is that when you give your presentation a name, be sure you name it. It's nice to give it a a concise name. But just name it the the name of your project. So if you're working on Dns, call it Dns, call it something short, and that will identify your presentation. Don't call it Hack presentation or it'll be hard to find. It look like these templates. If you take a look at the Read me, it will also point out is what you need to do to get yourself added two the Github. Org. Because you need to be a member of that organization in order to have the ability to to upload and edit files on it. So you'll see some instructions here that I just highlighted with the the red box. It's important to do that in advance don't wait till the last minute. Please follow that, send us a quest, we will add you to the F github org if you are a member of that already. If you got added at a previous Id etf hack or something else, then fine you you're good. You don't need to do this for each hack on. You just need to do it once. And again, if you have any questions about that, just come see me or one of my c chairs. And we'll give you a hand. Any questions about that? Okay? Okay. Then this is a relatively new cape ability that I still like to point out to people that I think is is really helpful. Related implementations. We talked about that we're working on running code related to the the Internet draft. That we're standardizing. And this is a way that you can make those known to the people who are reading the drafts, who may not even know anything about the hack of on. So What you see here is a draft that that I wrote"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:20:01",
    "text": "It's actually about making it easier to find running code. If you look in the data tracker, you'll see something called additional resources. And we've been using this for a while to do things like to point to a github repo that you can use to collaborate on your draft. Well you can also as an additional resources add your code. As a related implementation. So if you go and you click on the edit button, what you'll see is that it pops up a dialogue box you can go and you can define one of these related implementations. And here, what I do is I have it point to what was an Internet draft later became an Rf that that was a demonstration of how to implement this policy. So... And then you can see how it pops up in the data tracker is something that you can access success. Maybe a better example, is if you look at the last Hack, we have a project here on Sr v. And you can see that they pointed to some drafts. Well those drafts use the related implementations that you see here and they had that point to a github or... Sorry. I get how. That was actually providing an implementation. Of that draft that they were writing. So this way, when people go to the data tracker, they not only find the Internet draft. They can find the code. That you've written or that someone's written that that will help with either your understanding or implementation or adding support of that that didn't draft. So for those of you here, please... If you do have some code related to a draft you're working on. Please try using this related implementations. And I'd like to see this really become a a know, more common that people use this in the idea. I think it'll really help make it easier for people to find all this great code that you're working on. Related to your drafts. And if you want to learn more about that, here's a pointer to the draft that I was mentioning about talks about this whole process."

    "startTime": "00:22:00",
    "text": "Of trying to make it easier to find code related to Rf and Internet drafts. And I you know, take a look, I welcome comments on that. And we'll actually be talking about this in the the Ed session later this week. Okay. Then just a couple more things. When the hack ends here. There's actually still a couple more events that you might be interested in. One is called Hack demo happy hour. And that's just a fun event for those who want to to get together and to present their projects in a more extended fashion. So we have a whole hour instead of just three minutes. You can get some space at the table you can set up a bit of a demo of what you did or just be there to have people come by and interact with you and ask you questions about your hack project. And now that's an opportunity then to have these deeper conversations. Than really that three minute presentation allowed. So if you're interested in doing this, and I hope you are You can sign up. There's a wiki page off of the Hack Wiki where you can you can do this. Make sure you register by by the end of the lunch break tomorrow. So that then we make sure we have enough space for everyone have a designated area for your project. And should just be a fun time. So that's Monday, Monday evening from six thirty to seven thirty. And then one last thing like we we we always have an lounge and there'll be a section in there called the code lounge. Just going to be set aside and and provide a space for you to continue to work on your project. Won't have this Hack space. We'll have a different room. It's actually going to be upstairs. But it there should still be plenty of space there. For you to come and continue to work on code throughout the week. So you may find it handy to advertise when you're going to be there just to make it a little bit easier for people to arrange their schedules."

    "startTime": "00:24:00",
    "text": "So feel free to to do that. It's perfectly fine for multiple teams to be meeting there at this same time in case I think that's that's actually a good thing. So feel free to sign up, that would be available throughout the week. Lastly, and this is really fantastic. We introduced this concept of being people sponsoring the Hack, and and it's starting to catch on, we actually have a full compliment, we have a goal, to silver a bronze sponsor. So I really wanna to thank Eric, Meta and and I can all for sponsoring the Hack this time. This is fantastic. It's it's great to see that type of support. That actually enables large groups of people like this to be here and and and work on this. So So I'm super excited that we have that. So so thank you to our sponsors. If you see people from those companies throughout the week be sure to thank them because you know, we really need their support to be able to have this this type of event. And unless there's any questions, Anyone here have a question? If you want to, you can ask it now. Otherwise, you're free to come see me at any time or one of my coat chairs. Okay. Great. Well, I will let you get to your your projects. Thanks a lot your attention. I know it's hard to listen to me especially those of you who have heard this several times. But I appreciate you giving me your attention and and thanks for for that. Now I hope you have a great hack. Thanks everyone."
