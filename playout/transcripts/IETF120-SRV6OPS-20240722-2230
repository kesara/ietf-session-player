I'm just going to start by entprising on the note well it's our first meeting, so we're going to go over some logistics for the working group So as not well, just be mindful when you sign and register we agree to about a few policies. Be mindful about what we say because everything is recorded for an IPR and privacy perspective perspective the note really well is really to unface on the anti-arrestment Be respectful amounts each other when we talk We are trying to be professional between one another, so if the talk. We are trying to be professional between one and other. So if there's any style or raise our voice, please take this off in the corridor, I would say for the people that are in the virtual meeting be also mindful for between us in the room versus the people that attend remotely for the the mic and the questions questions And the logistics make sure that you are registered with the QR code and that's it We're going to move to the oh, we have minute takers, I think we're good to go for the rest of the so we go to the charter charter Yes, it's stuck"

We're going to have a few words from the from jim the ad charters, the milestone. We're going to recap a little bit around the charter. We're going to have a few words from Jim, the AD. And then we're going to go over some presentation from operators We're going to start with Variety horizon and china unicorn in fact 10 And then we're going to review the draft that are already submitted in the content Charters and Leicester. Yes, so since this is our first meeting we wanted to set the stage right let's all go over the charter that we have all agreed to so that we can avoid confusions over what this work, what work belongs in this working group. I'll also go over the milestones that have been agreed with the IESG So this is our main description of the charter. We are going to focus only on the operational aspects and we will focus mainly on the SRV6 network So things which are very IPV6 generic, that doesn't belong here, things which are common with SRM as well as SRV6, that also doesn't belong here this is going to be specific to what's what's happening with the SRV6. We are a generic forum for network operators to come and discuss that's why we have those operator presentations and even in future we want to invite more of these kind of presentations. So when you guys are outside and meet operators in other forums, tell about SRV6 ops, ask them to come in present"

The scope we will be focusing on informational documents only so there is not going to be any solutions work we will not be updating any protocols there was initial discussion whether BCP is in scope or not, but at the time we did there is not going to be any solutions work. We will not be updating any protocols. There was initial discussion whether BCP is in scope or not, but at the time we decided that let's keep it scope for now, focus on guidance, focus on informational documents for now but as we gather more and more experience, we could of course re-charter and include BCPs in future. One more activity that we were do is there is a lot of work which is in flex, a lot of development happening in spring there are SR extension in various different working groups so we need to make sure to have clarity on what belongs in operational aspect of SRV6. So we will make sure that every time we adopt any document, we will consult with the response area director who is in who is in our case also responsible for spring. So we could have a good coordination between the two groups And things which are still in under development, we will try to be careful and not give and not create confusion with the same discussion happening in two different venues. The things which are still in development in other working group, it's best they are discussed in those working groups itself. Of course, there could be some presentations here for inviting more participation, gathering operational input but the real work belongs in those working groups Our scope, operational issues and requirement, we will talk about new innovative deployment scenarios What are the new guidance from operational side managers?"

Spring, we need to do have a good and close cooperation, as well as various different working groups that are listed here. We will make sure that we will cross post things across working groups so that people are very aware and we don't do things in silos And final bit, this is our set of milestones that we have Our main aim is to work on a document which describe operational and management issues So that's what we will be working on first. And then there are a bunch of other things that we have highlighted and of course these things can change. So if there is based on the working group feedback if some milestone needs to be added update feel free to reach out to the chairs and that's all about charter now you want to give Flo to Jim. Jim, this is our first meeting if you have any words for guidance that you can give to the working group, floor is yours. Thank you, Joe Can you hear me okay? Yes. Okay So first of all, an apology to the work group. I was planning to be there face to face, but I got crowd struck and my flight was canceled.

And one of the things that we are was that I would take over the as responsible AD for this working groups so that I can closely monitor what happens here as well as in spring to help make sure that that you know there's no issues between the two working groups Obviously, as was said by Drew, we really need to pay careful attention to the Charter, making sure that we stick to that and we only work on things that are within that charter. I will say that I'm in conversation with the spring chairs at the moment to work on their charter. There was a little bit in that charter that overlapped and we're in the process of cleaning that up. That was something that I agree to as part of forming this working group So I guess to to underline this working group is not a replacement, nor is it an extension of spring. I want that to be very, clear. And hence, we've been very clear on the charter, and hence that I took on the responsibility of the AD for the working group. And I guess in close, thanks to the chairs for stepping up I really appreciate that.

Okay So my name is luay jalil for some, for people that don't know me. I'm a distinguished fellow in Variety And today I'm going to talk to you about SRV in Verizon. When I first was asked to make this, my immediate thinking was to talk to you about our SRV6 design and architecture. But I thought, why would you want to to tell you how I design SRV6, regardless if I'm talking about? to talk to you about our SRV6 design and architecture. But I thought, why would you want me to tell you how I design SRV6, regardless if I'm talking to the vendors or operators? Instead, I'll tell you why we're going down the path of SRVC what is our motivation, and what is our requirement So next slide. All right So I'm going to talk about the Verizon Network in general you know just to show you kind of the size and the amount of services we have I'll talk to you about the motivation, why we needed something new and different. And then I'll talk to you why SRV6 specifically and our requirements for it So I'm trying to be kind of brief here and not spend a lot of time and get it to it. We have a lot of variety networks, large and small and even the small ones are actually part of the large network, but each has its own administrative domain. And all these networks are kind of interconnected magically, you know, between them to offer some seamless services, regardless of these services and as you can see between consumer business, financial, government, wireline, wireless, you name it. The one correction I would make on the diagram, I duplicated consumer fiber to the home twice. One is enterprise, one is consumer so that's the only correction I would make here We actually utilize a lot of traffic engineering. We started all the way from RSPTE. We're a big RSPTE shop in some areas"

    "text": "We use SRMPLS and we're slowly getting an SRV6. We actually outside of traffic engineering, we still have LDP in some places but a lot of it is going to evolve and become kind of the new evolution to say what is the new, what is the new thing? and why do we need it? Next slide. By the way, I'll probably go through these things really fast just because of my speed, so let me know I'll probably save you some time. So what is the motivation? We have a lot of applications today for different network function regardless of their physical, virtual you know containerized so we need to be cater for all these services. We actually have to be software-defined networking for lack of better word but there's more control from a software-defined perspective. And then general virtualization needs Consolidating footprint Footprint is important for us. Power space and cooling is becoming as we're growing and growth is becoming power space cool and becoming critical so you want more efficient network equipment and minimize the footprint in some places where we can't even fit our big large boxes of routers. Enhance and simplify riders and minimize the footprint in some places where we can't even fit our big large boxes of routers. Enhance and simplify routing, that's always been a goal of ours. How do we efficiency and manageability so we can simplify for operations team. Application-aware router you know, I'll know some people might think application have to care for themselves, and in some cases they do but in some cases we actually roni even the application and we have to cater for them. So we want some applications that are based on, you know, aware of what it needs and the network can kind of cater to it service velocity, we have a huge network. Time to market is very important to us on top of getting stuff tested and certified and even introduce it in the network it takes a while. So we want to be able to do this at a fast pace so we can offer new services faster Centralized controller to get a holistic view of the network. As you can see, we have multiple domains in the network and every domain looks at its own self maybe you can"

However, we need some more efficient distribution. So how can I optimize my edge rotting, especially when we start talking about network slides? mobile edge compute, and all the other stuff that I actually is closer to the customer. So these things become important So it's not one way or the other So we have centralization, but we need some distribution for some routing. And then at the end, I think that's always been a goal to simplify rotting can i simplify the number of protocols that I create and simpler? Just because we're coming from a world where almost every single thing needed a protocol, now maybe one or two sets of protocol can serve what we need. Next slide All right. So SRV6, where do we see SRV-6? I draw all these networks and services to you, but they're really residing in all these locations So between wireless locations, they centers and data centers could be in wireless and wireline a Verizon Cloud platform, that's our own compute our internal cloud platform that resides in multiple locations fires, and I probably should have generalized this, but this is fiber to the home, our services, our DWRs, our BN own compute, our internal cloud platform that resides in multiple locations. FI.S. And I probably should have generalized this, but this is fiber to the home. Our services, our GWRs, our BNGs, all that good stuff. Wireless mobile switching centers, you know, we have those radio access network. I mean, this is a large number of smaller sites, huge in a huge amount of numbers. And then hub and regional hubs those are more specific to our kind of a metro ULH kind of a terminology. That's what we call them. Hub and regional hubs. And then we have global existence and international sites. Some of you know us of 701s 702, 703, you pick your AS with dependent on what country you're in but we have presence for our actually in enterprise services and internet services internationally"

    "text": "So the next slide is going to talk about why SRV6. Some of this stuff is redundant You'll actually see it, but simplify protocol stack So I think it meets it, uses IP only eliminating the need of MPLS. It doesn't mean MPLS is bad but as we simplify the protocol, you know, SRV stack. So I think it meets it, uses IP only eliminating the need of MPLS. It doesn't mean MPLS is bad. But as we simplify the protocol, you know, SRBC's kind of meets. Remember, we're doing SRMPLS in a lot of places, but I'll talk about it a minute. But the simple the protocol is important. Advanced traffic engineer business rules, constraints, these are, as we get in the different services, regardless in the wireless especially on the 5G side, as new services come up and even wireline as we're trying to kind of even the services between wireline and wireless, we need these advanced traffic engineering capabilities. Similarly, end-to-end connectivity using SR again back to the encapsulation symbol protocol. If we can get around across multiple domains, I mean, the picture that I'd didn't show you here when you take a call flow from the beginning to the end, you're actually going across the surface. I'll give you an example. You go through wireless then you go to Metro, and then that's another domain. You come back to wireless then it hands it to wireline depending on if you're going to the internet, whatever. So there's a lot of really networks that this call flow goes through, and we need that seamless connectivity between them We're a big RSPTE shop. We have RSPT in a lot of places Reducing the need for this TE tunnels makes it simple for us. Maybe we can eliminate them at some point but, you know, my goal right now is reduce the need for all these centers that we're building for the different services Comprehensive support, we're actually big on doing SR in the fabric or on the one you know some people might look at it differently but we want to be able to have that comprehensive support both in the fabric and on the WAN You know, network slicing is important to variety and we believe that SRV6 meet the industry network slice and models and even for Verizon Selective device support that's required that we don't we can actually add devices that don't have support"

    "text": "SRV6. I want to get to the last actually three. So Linux OS compatibility so this is one of the main ones that drove us to SRV6 So we had SRMPLS, we wanted to compute to be part of the SR domain and working with different people from the Linux. We couldn't get SRMPLS or actually MPLS support in Linux but SRV6 was a much easier lift So this is why we're actually part of this is support Linux unlike SRMPLS. We're actually big on going to SRV6 just to include that Remember, we do a lot of softwareization on our devices So a lot of our service actually residing in some you know, some network functions, so we need to be able to bake that by part of the SR domain. And that's where the last point is If we integrate that compute as part of these services, then we can do end-to-end traffic engineering Let's go to the next slide. I think it's last slide so what is our requirement and again uh you'll see those are being repetitive. So seamless transition, we cannot flip the switch and go to SRV6 or any other protocol. So we have to have a transition period so interworking in our probability is very critical for us We need to have a smooth transition. Without that, it's hard for us to move from one protocol to the other without a big forklift. So that's important Functionality, and the reason I call it functionality versus feature because I don't like to call features by name. I like to say what? the function of that feature can I satisfy with the new protocol So at minimum, I have to maintain the same functionality cable don't like to call features by name. I like to say what the function of that feature can I satisfy with the new protocol. So at minimum, I have to maintain the same functionality capability that I have, and then some. We know there'll be advanced stuff, but at minimum, we're trying to maintain the current needed functionality we need our network The scale architecture, as you can see, we have different sizes, different places, some in the core some at the edge close to the customer so we need the right side and we need to make sure that that protocol can accommodate this right size I saw the note, what was it, resilient, secured efficient, very important.

    "text": "this right size. I saw the note, what was it, resilient, secured, efficient, very important. And they're all kind of fall in. So reliability is one of the currencies. So we have to always maintain rapid and resilient so any protocol we do has to have their resilience built in or if it's not at least seamless so we can have that, you know, from a reliability perspective Risk mitigation security you know, comes together. These are a must. Open standards open APIs and I'm just going through this stuff I mean this is where you can read it yourself I'm just trying to kind of add some flavor to it. A failure domain reduction We actually have to make sure that from a failure domain, how can we isolate failure domain? What is the blast radius? And we need to make sure the protocol we do can minimize those failure domains reduction And at the end, and not that the least important, it is I mean, it's not the least, it's the most important. And actually, files with everything is to focus on the cost we're bit so anything we do we look at the cost efficiency and that cost efficiency is not just equipment cost what is the equipment, how much does it get to power? it? What is the space? How much to manage it? So all that stuff when you do a total cost of ownership aligns together, that's how we do the cost per bit. And it's not just capital It's CAPX and OPEX I'm actually done with this and maybe I'll give you some time here you want to leave the question till the end or if you have any question now is the time. For good idea comment idea. Or comment please use the QR code Hi, thanks for your presentation. Mike, me, Brian Futureway. So in meeting with customers this year so far, to discuss SRV6, the two primary questions that have come from that, the first of what you answer is, you know, what does SRV6 give me over in PLS? And you've, you could have discussed that, which is great. The other one is, which goes along with this slide, is in Brownfield environments, is there, um, help with transitioning from our existence? brownfield environment to an SRV6? You know, do we?"

So you've listened to the requirements I'm not sure if it falls within the charter of this work group but that would be something that would be a helpful document to kind of talk about transitioning to SRV6. That's not sound reasonable? Yes First question, please use the tool. We all agree that we will call in a common Meetecho for both remote as well as in person. So people who are going up, please be all agree that we will get in a common Meetecho for both remote as well as in person. So people who are coming up, please make sure to join the queue. Thank you And second is yes, we have in fact one document initially. So our question would be the we would like how to convert this into use guidance into the documents worth documenting as a part of our document that SRV 6Ops can work on So we need to convert these requirements clarity on like what are operational challenges, what are the gaps that are currently there in the existing standards and what future work that can be done So let's break this down into a little bit more granularity that would we needed. But as a first presentation, I think this was very good to set the stage and to set at higher level before we go down into those weeks. Agreed just to add to that, I'll tell you, we have an initial experience and some of this stuff, but there's a lot of work to be done. Looks like even some in a working, you know, I've seen some inner work in draft that are think could be held for here. So I think there's more work to be done And I just didn't want to set the stage telling you how I'm doing it I'm just set the stage as a community. We need to make sure that these things in place to make it easier for operators to kind of deploy these technologies with these. Agreed Thank you. Thank you. Nick? Hi, nick buraglio, ESNet And I'm going to ask an operational question here and you can tell me if this is the wrong place for it.

Customers use SRF6, provide lines for data transmissions, traffic scheduling through service chain lines for data transmissions, traffic scheduling through service function chain, and enter the cloud for processing by service functions And the China Unicom has deployed these scenarios on the network in many places like the Guangdong, Jiangsu, and so on, including the backbone network and the metro area network For example, on our smart metro area network in Guangdong province, China, we can see. We offer the secure private line products through 866-based service function chain Based on the original is that we think it's private life enterprise customers can schedule traffic to the cloud through the service function chain and invoke the virtual mobile application firewall and the their I'm going to go on the fiber service in the cloud in the danyang chen"

The main reason is that there is not enough support for SF6 on cloud devices Then when the service function team is implemented, a proxy note needs to be deployed outside of the cloud to complete SM6 for voting. In this way, when there are multiple service functions in the code business traffic will be passed back and force by change the proxy node and the service in the code thus affecting the efficiency of the service And in addition, IPVSA and SM states are not supported in the cloud at will So making it impossible to implement extreme detection between the cloud and the network This also affects the status of knowledge material of the customer like business and reduced the user experience Shenzhen, your audio is very choppy Can you maybe speak closer to the mic?

First of all, private-life service buster services and services function change. SMC for voting is not supported in the cloud and only out of the cloud agents can be used which affects service efficiencies At the same time, because IPV6 or SMC is not supported in the cloud the private line cannot be detected between the cloud and the network with the flow. In this way, the fault cannot be limited and accurately located So further, the FURT cannot be limited and accurately located. So further, the workers, this can be a headache Oh, but Anna says they are about problems during their application departments So we proposed a solution This solution is to become virtual router in the cloud like the red-ruder, which can support IPV6 and the SNFSI protocol"

At that time, we didn't have much requirement of VPN but later when we decided to launch enterprise services we assessed MPILUS, segment routing ampillus, NSI NSRV-6. Because our infrastructure, was on IP basics, SAVASICs made most the sense And also because it removes the extra ampilus stack and I believe that removal of that extra stack will reduce the software issues it returns to native IP routing and allow us the achieve hyperscalability through prefix summarization So high level, as I design, the building blocks of any ISP network which are topology, both physical logical, IP addressing local test schema, employed protocols services what we offer, as well as right levers for fast convergence. So quick conversion is very crucial to ensure no outage during network and services provided redundancy is there"

But we have 59 IGP domains, few prefecture based on number of node, node density and the area size demand more IGP domains and we have two 59 IGP domains few prefecture based on number of node density and the area size demand more IGP domains and we have total around 14k 15k as ever sector of node, node density, and the area size, demand more IGP domains. And we have total around 14K, 15K, as I have a system enabled node, that is scale and size of the network. On the addressing schema, we decided to go with Yula addressing not rotable outside of the network. This is F-30 section standard. One block slash 32 we use 224 slash 40 pools. Rest I'll reserved for Lib. We are located one or more this slash 40 pools to each IGP domains so that we can do summarization at the ABR level So far we have allocated 133 slash footage pools. That gives us total 57k locators, but we are using only 15K That means we still have 74% available for network expansion once we do summarization in the cool we will have hardly 500 perfect and that's a major advantage of our service scaleability For any new flex algorithm, there's another slash 32 block from the allocated slash 24 block and from the current addressing schema we can use up to 8 flexelgo Next on the protocol, what we have deployed, the bare minimum protocol, ISS for underlie BGP for overlay, BFD for a quick filial detection, EV pin for L2B pin, LSE, for bundling, VRP for PHRP, VHRP, VGPL for routing analytics and controller base SRT.

On the services, what we have deployed it is 4G, 5G mobile services with over 7 million subscribers, fixed line internet, and now expanding B2B services, low latency, path using SRPM and flexelgo and effective bandwidth utilization using demand metrics are in plan Okay. Now I will cover the IGP design The left and right side we have two IGP domains which are connected to code domain. This is just a depiction, but similarly we have 59 such IGP domains which are connected to core. And then we are doing redistribution at the ABL level. So now you can see that core has total more than 15K locators in its IGP routing table adding one more flexelgo would add another 15k routes and this is not scalable However, prefix summarization will reduce this 15k routes to less than 500 but still we have not done summarization yet and why because prefix summarization capability of SRV6 provides ultra high scalability but summarization comes with one caveat It hides the unreachability information while redistributed hides only the topology information, summarize also hides topology as well as unreachability information. In other words, ABI creates the impression that it can reach all more specific prefixes, but this promise breaks into scenario One, note fails, but other and remote node still have next hop in its IGP thus keep forwarding traffic to the down node till bgp will go down with the RRR. Second, in case of area partistening, ABR at attracts traffic even for nodes to which it does not have richer reachability now. So what is the solution?"

    "startTime": "00:42:02",
    "text": "So for first problem, we are using UPA on reachability prefix announcement If ABR would detect any node going down, which it was hiding earlier, unreachable information, now ABA will advertise an unreachability prefix information. And on basis of that RR or remote node can react to it for BGP pick or BGP convergence So the second problem, which is area partitioning, the two ABII will talk to each other, send probe continuously once they detect a node communication, they stop doing summarization and start advertising more sports prefixes. Thus we we avoid any black holeing in case of area of partisaning this is a rare case only in case or double outage but still this can cause a major outage. So we wanted to go for this feature before we do someization So once we upgrade network to an X release, where we have this two feature we'll do summarization and then we can reduce the number of routes in the core and then we can add Flexelgo to add more locators in the network Okay, I will cover our migration strategy because our service deployment is 100% done. So yeah, for migration we opted to create a parallel SR6 info by creating a new sub interface on each NNI new ISI instance, and IGP redistribution The speedy SR6 info deployment without affecting existing routing was possible with this approach And once Infra got completed, the connected hub node, which you can see here, EGP routers, which are connected data center we used a unique solution of we are right we are node, which you can see here, AG4 routers, which are connected data center, we used a unique solution of we are a flight solution.

This gives us more and better services offering using existing infrastructure Single SIF6 fabric, big as SRI6 fabric, reduce the provisioning touch point faster provisioning, and easy to automate less human error also In hop-by-hop routing architecture, it was very difficult to maintain routing consistency on all the node and also the conflict consistency and it was causing outages While in the underlay-overlay architecture, it is very, very easy to maintain the routing consistency because it's an eye and ISS. So it has to be consistent and then it also reduces the provisioning touch point okay uh we come has to be consistent and then it also reduces the provisioning touch point okay we completed this this slide covers the service section we completed this project in two and a half three years we spent around a year on planning designing and testing.

That brings stability and scale in the data center devices 56% reduction in conflict touch point Now only two ends to conflict for any service and this as our six fabric And 90% improvement in the convergence because of TIL and also reduction in overall routes and we'll reduce this number of routes further with the after prefix summarization I could not cover all the network improvements which helped us to reduce this many LSP and routes, but maybe can expand in some other one-on-one session Okay this is last slide and all the numbers what we discussed in the previous slide and improvement to the network is of less significance unless it is acknowledged by the operation team and translates to enhance user experience. This graph illustrates how service impacting occurrences decrease by 93% after our service experience deployment.

What do you think? is the main difference? Yeah It's not only FS6 capability, but lower number of service-affecting incidents. What do you think such as the main difference? Yeah. It's not only FI.6 but in general, overall network restructuring, re-architecting helped to reduce this outages And I mentioned earlier, in the hop-by-how routing architecture, you need to maintain routing consistent on every node. If there's no routing consistency because then you're avi-routed that time which we call AG3 was acting as a BGP route reflector, it has to reflect route on every router in short you have to maintain a routing consistency because decision is being taken on each hop If there's a routing inconsistency, you can cause out. Also, if that time on also, we were using summarization Summization and there's a more specific route exchange between two router. One router can attract traffic but it cannot deliver traffic to other router unless there is a tunneling capability.

So the IPV6 route, the IPV6 route, naturally support the E2E in the dormant by utilizing the IPV6 routeability. So the IPV6 route aggregation reduced the number of SOMA6 locators distribution for the interdormant deployment.
