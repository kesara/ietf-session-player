Sadly. Thank you, Ronald. Appreciate it. I apologize for that because I know this came last minute. We were thinking of, you know, I'm sure doing lots of productive things and, you know, getting that pulled off probably, probably is gonna slow some things down and the official It of responses schedule more to include you want to have in person in a meetings. Okay. Thank you, Roman. Roman and I have been also talking about this since try to find other ways? What one that... That's still on ongoing discussion. Thanks. Okay.

You hash those individually. And put the hash where the original claims. Used to be. Instead of just putting the claim name and value there, that's a new key that's called Underscore c and a that key array and then the array That's must be at the same level as the original, put all the hash of the disclosures.

And the verify, obviously, then sends the thing that was signed by Sd? Plus selection of the disclosures. So it doesn't send all the disclosures usually. But only those disclosures for the claims that are to be released to that specific. Next slide, please? If desired, the verify can also add a so called hold binding, which means that essentially holder creates a new job that is signed by the holder using a public key that has contained in the original Sd. So rather verify assess I know that this is a key of this specific color. So they sure assess that. So to verify I can see that be however actually in possession of the private key belonging two that. Public key that's in the Sd. Next slide, please.

Then you take whatever has close to you and put it back into the original location in the Sd. You'll check the hold binding if that is required by your application and you're done. That's the verification. Next slide please? As I said, we had these former changes after last Meeting, we had another update since then. Most important, points that we updated is that we now have or that we now allow what it's called what we call nested disclosures, So within a disclosure, there can be an object which again contains hash of other disclosures. That's a feature that's actually quite natural to the design that we have. We for whatever reason, this allowed that in a previous version But then we noticed that it's not only easier to actually allow. But also, it enables you to create whether they're very fine and friendly leveraging.

I need to disclose only one or two out of Oc array elements. And the to approach you see on the screen or the proposed side I mean, the Daniel has been working on... So first would be in the So one thing is receiver, or stage would have to differentiate whether array contains hash or plain text. And to do design, one proposal is to put underscore as the element to signal, like, a first element array to signal that, hey. What follows are tasha, not plain values. And It's usual two options. Right? Second options would be let's name space. So that each hash with have underscore is the column and Alright. Anything similar in front of them to clearly name space indicate. It's it's a hash.

Maybe from some then need could paper part something with pick paper or something? Okay. It's it's a it's a very simple approach. So you're just The idea is you're just hash the plain text value. And you sign over the hash of the plain value. Mh. To avoid that you can just from looking at the hash and then guessing the plain text value, Okay.

Thank you. Because schemes, is that something like is much more complex. So I think from an in perspective. You I I I wanna... you need a hash algorithm. So when chapter two five six is basic one that we have in this stack. On top of that when you're signing a Aws, you can use whatever G aws signatures you support. An algorithm trace perspective, like, that's what you need. Okay. Thank you. Tobias. Yeah. Just going back to that proposal. It's just so understand for the array elements, what data types from adjacent perspective, would you be looking for for the claim values? Is that objects or just like little values like basic types like strings numbers. Berlin Anything? Yes. So how would you handle a case where you have an array of objects? Well this... It would look just like this. But disclosure the array that was created would contained in a position of the last element an object. Right. Okay. I'll I'll the same mess we have currently. Yet Where essentially, the hash takes the place of whatever the thing lost before which can be an object into integer Whatever. And so the the only other any other like feedback I had on this was that an approach to you do unless you consistently validate all the elements in the array to have the prefix then you might end up with the next. You you'd get an ambiguity up I looking at this as a map or as an object, basically in terms of what national is supposed to represent.

Again, there's a github have issue number and next slide would have one proposal So me disagree. This is Daniel's proposal on the slide where So essentially Jason's utilization would have adjacent object where payload and the signature or separate key value pairs and introducing additional key value pair disclosures away? You should have those disclosures instead of doing is d to that disclosure to the disclosure. You would put disclosures into this array. And another approach with the blair.

After they have been acquired, and that covers everything from using using local storage that is, you know, Javascript writing into that and reading data from it. Also, Also keeping the tokens away from the browser by using back end component. So it covers that whole range of options. Also in that section is part that talks about why not to use the Javascript cookie Api to store tokens, which hopefully what doing. There is a new section that talks about center constrained tokens and adding a reference to as a way to do that inside kind of the one of the goals that B up is to be a a browser accessible version of center Constraint Tokens. Those in in the draft, there's the whole the sort of the main part of the draft is this our patterns to talk about the different pure javascript apps versus apps with the back end, and then within that, whether the back end is entirely a epoxy or for the javascript or just epoxy to acquire the that whole section I've now rephrase it to focus on the the goal of acquiring Tokens rather than like building gaps. So it's really... Because it's really what we're talking about in the world is. Does the happen to get the tokens? Some corrections of terminology.

I think there's a note about the implicit flow, which now also mentioned the fact that of the main points of it was that cores wasn't really possible or in browsers when Was written. And there was a lot of discussion about the service worker pattern on and off the list and I think we've resolved that discussion mainly by essentially describing better the limitations available or that are that are part of using service workers as a way to manage no. So that's that's what's new. A lot of that again, this is mostly based on the discussions that we've already had. So hopefully this is not surprising to anybody? One open two two sort of main issues that I wanna wrap up if for this is ready to go. Somebody brought up a new variation of the of a using a back end, which is to use the back end to quote store the tokens, but storing them as http b only cookies. So it's not Javascript accessible, Cookies. There's no storage. There's no persistent storage in the back end itself. But it's using cookies to be where of the tokens left. That is not in the draft yet. I think it's a valid pattern to add and again, there are interesting differences compared to the other patterns which I think it makes it interesting to call out. So I do plan on a section that talks about that. If anybody has opinions about that, please make them known. Again, the goal of this draft is not to say, any one of these is the one way you should write your apps is to point out all of the differences in and trade offs in all the different options."

And the last topic here is this idea of storage isolation, which kinda gets to the the the core of this whole this section the the new section that was added in the last couple of versions about storing tokens and browsers. The short version is there is no best solution for storing tokens and browsers. Because of limitations of browsers. Any Api that accessible to the browsing context is vulnerable their cross scripting attacks. And the only way to avoid the risk of storing tokens vulnerable across scripting taxes to not put them in browsing context accessible code. At other words use the back end and keep the tokens there. Which kind of really just moves the problem around. Doesn't entirely solved the problem. A service worker is a decent option because the the storage the service worker memory is not accessible to the browsing context. However, there isn't a persistent Api isolated storage to service workers is only the the index db, which is also a it's, like shared with the rest of the that the app. So there isn't really a good best option. So One of the things that that came up in this discussion was should we as a working group. Document this as, like, there is a gap in the in the browser technology that we would like to you if it existed, we would have a better solution to this. And like, formally document that as, like, this is a request to you know, the rest of the the the community involved in making browsers and operating systems for creating an Api that is"

I would just sort of drill in and say what do we mean by secure storage in terms of talking like what would the properties of that storage making doesn't be, would it be, you know, obviously, if it's still available javascript applications, then used still have vulnerabilities, but there's, you know, sitting isolation that we we could make to improve certain vectors of I've token theft and those sorts of things of that if those are the attacks were after sort of occurring. So I think you know, drilling into what we would should be looking for from a secure storage solution from requirements would probably how guide that conversation. Otherwise it would be. You know, maybe ambiguous? Yeah. The specific app that that I'm referencing here is The the document talks about using a service worker to acquire the tokens if you can do that, then the tokens that are acquired by the servers are not accessible to the rest of the Javascript app. However, there's nowhere for the service worker to permanently store those tokens. So if there was, like, local storage available to the service worker that was isolated in service worker. That would be very Pacific solution to that. Again, Caveat with the rest of the... This is was spelled out. Length of the draft, but that's solves cross scripting attacker being unable to steal the token, but it can still, of course, call the service worker to use the token.

If you were okay if authenticating them before you I think that's may choose to be okay authenticating them again. where the... I think that's the problem though is that there isn't an authentication of the client here.

Many desktop apps do not follow the native Apps best practice for mainly, for example, popping out to the system browser to do a redirect base flip. A lot of them will open up their own in app browser to keep keep the user experience better. So Rather than go bought but point by point through all of the the comments from, I think the way to resolve this, but also to capture the current state. Of of is that Scoping the native apps, best current practice recommendations specifically to the mobile operating systems where they are generally followed and do work well and provide a better experience than other options. Just kind of leaving the desktop world open and unspecified and because that's kind of a current state of the world is that we actually don't have a best practice recommendation for desktop apps because people clearly haven't been following it because they're not happy with the user experience. In that role if they were to follow the native apps. So that's my Proposed resolution for this is basically take the native apps recommendations and then just make sure that that it is specifically referring to mobile operating systems. can wrap it up. And then after that, we Greater recommendation. Think like we can still do better.

Again, kind went back to the reorganization of how the types are defined in the spec. There's a common section that all grand times extend from, which lists the required parameters for all request the token endpoint. That in doing that process mistakenly, I had added the client Id parameter into that section because it looks like it's part of all the types, but it turns out actually, it is not required in the last two and many types that extend you do not include that parameter. So my plan is to can keep the client Id in that section course section, but call it optional since is included in many of the grant types, but just call that as optional and say and have each type specifically say whether or not it's required based on that own types requirements.

But there are x five out there There's a mechanism called open ip connect federation. The dates just train, which is a Dns based mechanism and on a lot of other things that people could use And what we have seen in the past is that certain ecosystems decided okay. We use this mechanism. So for example, in the open banking, a lot of ecosystems use dynamic registration with software statements. But there other mechanisms well. B, for example s dot com implemented proprietary mechanism where a unique client id is used across a thousand different. And In the world of wallets, it might be necessary wallet, for example, to be connected to different ecosystems. And those different ecosystems will most likely use different trust mechanisms. Just as an example on the right hand side, I could imagine that for example in the European Union going forward in the items x five zero nine, play a certain an important role for that. But our jurisdictions, other mechanisms might be needed be used. And the wallet for example could be the Microsoft authenticator could be that could be blah. So it's it's a really a general purpose Uni universal tool that cannot be really tied to a certain ecosystem. Well the question is how those kind of multi harming wallets?

On the left hand side, you see an authorization request obviously a request object that uses the client Id scheme redirect Ui. So in that case, by definition client Id and the the redirect audit must be the same value. And as you can see in the last parameter, you can also add additional client metadata data. As self data. And on the underneath, the coat, example, the request like example you see the processing rules rules. So this request must not be signed. And as I said, additional parameter can be passed. On the right hand side, just as a comparison, you see a request that users open connect federation. In this case, the client Id is under as the entity Id that's a term defined in the Open connect federation specification. Which is then used using val location and Api endpoints to to to obtain a trust chain to validate trans and more metadata data? In this case, any reader like you ui as allowed as long as is is prohibited by the metadata data obtained for open connect exploration. And the same was true. Data.

Right, There either the fam ecosystems. They are large iterations. They are obviously the context we're providing here is in in in the context of wallet some credential exchange but in general the the question is are there more applications out there with this kind of way in which the client is identifying itself to that. Yes. That we don't know about that we should be considering and and there's this generally useful in in the context of all. Okay. We have a few minutes here for if people have some thoughts this ideas or comments questions. Anything for you to economy. So interesting. I have to admit that I hard time following you are using terminology, which is not strictly off. So fire and. Given that, like, your wallet, sometimes is a client, sometimes is. So if we are talking in the context of off think that it would be very clear if we would use their plaintiffs that we use for off. So but these might just me my general limitation. But my main point is in the past the fact that some customers interpret the structure of a client id and took pen in it was actually a source of."

Now, I believe I understand how the ability of using actually the client this make sense for your scenario. So absolutely, it makes sense. A a bit worried general it because I feel like what I told the customer in the past, which is I'll help your for hud, but you got it yourself. This was in part of the contract. Instead of this will somewhat validate that kind of behavior. And so all the people that today are using the client as they were originally intended as just identifier from the physician server. We now have to cope with visa retroactively So that would be... Least start with the recommend putting a language in the spec with Says, please don't do that. And remember that there there are still a number of scenarios which both are assigned identifier and not structured And as a client, you are not supposed really understand it or act upon it. Thank you. So first of all, was the reason why I put As. In in brackets. So the wallet in this use cases acts as an authorization funnel. Regarding structuring, client id didn't not necessarily the structure. The the proposal or that what you have to sign an open a gives a label, right? Or passes a label to the A how to client at the one of the client server structure is up to the method. Being used. If you please just client, it's up to the As. How the that"

I agree with most of what you've laid out here.

Quick answer and then you know, we finish here. I think the the simplest answer to that because you quite right there plenty of adi that already do this and and effectively, they kind of treat them like they are pre registered client ids and and the sense of ours when they're not really. And the the problem with having like a that informally as the only pet you end up having to kind of sniff the client id. Arbitrarily and try and figure out if there is any structure to, which can be quite restless in situations and hard to extend. Sorry. I think it's a multi homing nature of the wallet, the twist that have on the slide where the same As has to support multiple ecosystem and that is emerging increasingly as a pattern. So I know Twist use medical will authenticate as an example. So in certain places, you're forced to did in other places who forced to the expired nine, and as wallet accepting it, it has been the tax I was there before was actually really really ugly.

And as we kind of continue conversation, also realize that there was a whole bunch of work going on and and me they work identity community that also very similar work going on here in Community. So the goal of of this session today in my presentation today is to kind of a little bit of context so on I'm Sp and we're clear identity be in general. And explore kind of a set of use cases that we have, here seven of them. I've I've got here today and and kind of see how how they map it into and also start some conversations about how we can number one, make it clear how these two things work together. And number two, also if if we can kind of, like, converge some of this parallel work that that we have going on would be awesome. So I'm here today, also tomorrow have this conversation. So if any of this is interesting, please tap me on the shoulder. I'll be around Right. So first, is all this stuff? Sp is set of specifications for workload identity. Inspire software implementation, of that there are several implementations of Sp. Spire is the only kind of, like, full blown standalone implementation. A lot of other implementations baked into other products and and projects like service mesh, things like this. What is if he do, if he does really well, the solve this problem of secure introduction or secret zero, bootstrap, however you wanna call that. So that solves this bottom tread problem. Workloads don't need to have any kind of prior knowledge of who they are. They don't need to have any credential in order to join scheme. It works very, very well in highly elastic, distributed compute environments. You know, as Peter mentioned earlier, workloads come and go all the time. Need to be able to come up, get my identity, talk to things spin down in a matter of seconds."

And we solve the secret zero through of measurements, which I'll talk a little bit about the delivery of these credentials is fully automated and enables us to have very, very short lived documents and key rotation from the root all the way down. So these are some of the the big differences between sp other schemes out there. So I think it does not do as as we call and out of scope reason about authorization at all, we provide only this identity framework the way to authenticate workloads reason about their identities. You know, we we look toward authorization by building that solid foundation. Upon which people bring their own authorization. This can be you know, anything from simple allow list to all the way up to, you know, Reg and and dynamic policy. Computation, things like that. We also know really reason about human identities stay in our lane, work with. There are some places these things overlap which is just part the reason why here. And there are some people who are using sp for workload identity, but using specific for human identities rather, but it's super limited kind of access to production type stuff. Finally, we don't like to define any documents we use all existing documents. We kinda find these profiles on top. Idea here as we wanna work with the software you have already. So I should should you care about any of this? Two documents support today, x five nine and. Specifically we call these estimates But they're different. I mentioned this the key infrastructure like highly rotational and we provide not only the credentials for the identity, but we also provide the bundles the trust bundle. So you know, what route key is that workload should be trusting when it talks to other parties? So Sp oh have a lot of overlap. They're very different, but also very similar like to think that as kind of two sides of the same coin. There's a lot of shared problems I mentioned and and drop as well. This is the primary reasons. But I'm here today."

And the agent works together with the server to do remote at the station flows. You now, this is what we call node stations, plug, can be backed by hardware T can also be backed by cloud provider Apis things along these lines. Agent also provides what's called workload at what we call work with that station. So when I work boots up it attaches to this agent. The agent measures it out of band figures out who it is and then works together with the server, to issue a credential to those workloads and that's, you know, seven nine, sir. Keys, thoughts and the bundles, of course. And once you have all these together, the workloads can communicate with each other authenticate each other without the involvement of any of this spy infrastructure. Right. So There we go. Seven use cases, I know I'm going quick have a lot of time here. The first I'll try to kind of build up digital build up upon each other. So the first is super basic. Kind of just, you know, how do we how do we do the inter across these domains, you know, if we have bunch of workloads operating a specific domain, they want to access the resources by. affected What does this look like? We have people doing this today. It's very much choose your on adventure. Kind of undefined. So, you know, thinking about what this should look like is of a lot of interest and and and maybe writing something about that. Is also a lot of interest in our community. Related to that, you know, it's is this idea of registration. And Oh, I believe this is kind of thank you. Peter earlier for connecting the dots. The client trust presentation. We have, you know, all these hosts workloads that have an identity already. They want to enter into this auth ecosystem. How can we do this in a way that you know, not super heavyweight. So, you know, like trans"

So in order for somebody to validate these specific identities, they need to also be able to call out and and be able to kinda track those key rotations. Third is preserve these call stack identity, so we have problems in Sp where, you know, there's large micro service graph. Request as request transit this micro service graph. Oftentimes, you want to know the path that this request has taken through that through that infrastructure. There's all kinds of policy that people want to put here. And it's also kind of blends and with user identity people want to know, hey, this user has issued this request and I can prove that. Also, here is the password my infrastructure of that request took and then at the end you're right policy that enforces all of this stuff. So one example of that could be like a payment service. This is actually a real real use case we have payment service. The payment service only wants to move money if it can prove that the owner that account issued this request. And that request has translated the fraud detection service on its way to the payment service. Fraud detection service might not be the minus one hop. And so how do we kind of preserve these identities and wrap them up or chain them or whatnot as they as they traverse stack. Also how can we have this workload identities is coexist with the user. And what is that code coexistence? Look like Next, we have token theft. So, you know, this is like, hey, you know, we've this token all way down the change. If he requires audience value to be set, But we still... There's still kind of, like, not the strongest mechanism in the world. And so we're looking for ways to kind of, like, bind those tokens to the request itself such that they can't be popped off and replayed against other workloads in the stack. I should add to that one that oops."

So we look for we're try to look for solutions that can be kind of done locally quickly. Fifth is a it's steiner grained fine grained authorization. I don't know how how how well that fits in here. But you know, as all these attest station processes, I was talking about before, as those occurred, they throw off all this really useful information. And right now, we don't actually keep any of this information. We log it. But don't have a way to utilize it. And recording it somehow, emitting it, distributing it and consuming it at policy decision point or something that we're trying to figure out how to do. You can... This all this kind of stuff is super useful for for example, if you're trying to implement attribute based access control system. So gotta give a little sample policy here of how you might kinda consume these things. So that's number five. I've got a sixth one here, which is kind of this domain data distribution, City he has better was federated scheme, we took a lot of influence from C on how to support that you know, there's a j document, that kind of stuff. Biggest difference here as we support x five nine two. So you can fed x five zero nine and do Tls on tls between these domains. But how do you find that j cares endpoint? We don't have, like, a great solution for that right now. Pushes off onto an operator, so an operator will say, here's my trust domain. Here's the end endpoint. Here's is the scheme you should be using when you that endpoint, which is effectively, you know, how you validate authenticate that point.

So did have one more use case here but it's kind of a little further off. So I'll just skip over it. This is kind of about, you know, similar to the last one, collect. How do we collect all this information and use it in higher level systems for risk measurement or mediation, things like this bias in a pretty good position to remediate as our other systems. Also when work with as an identity, and everything is authenticated. Your the level of visibility is phenomenal so we want to kinda collect all this information and use it and use it a respond to to risks in the system. So I'll just fast forward get there's a lot of other things. That can be done. If there's anything here that comes to mind for you, please, please do let's talk. In the next day or two. And then I'll pass it to Peter to kind of help me map all of this stuff onto the work that's been going on in in this group. Yeah. So I I think in terms of next steps, one of things that we're thinking about is just starting off by documenting some of the use cases But then also, you know, I think there's sort of a number of artifacts or or standards that we can already start referencing and just giving guidance think one of the things is just making it clear and helping people understand how they can use to connect these two ecosystems. And and so this is sort of this idea of know, maybe we need to create a best current practice. To enable the developers that are...

The scenarios shown are very real very interesting scenarios. You think like about kept coming to mind as I was hitting a speak what... I wondering is a bit there layering with mismatch. Let's say that off doesn't do identity. It can help transport and and can do all the things that you describe But it seems like this is a particular application of they tools semi primitives method of offers. So somehow, I would expect the speaker side to say this is how we use of rather than of here where particular use all primitives that we defined. So just summarize, I think it was that very scenarios and I think the industry would benefit from adding more details I'm not sure if that's the charter or the of, but it's just my impression. Thanks, Mister. Hey do you have any comment? Yeah. I you know, I I don't know what side of the house is best for these things to land on. I and see the need for them. Right? Certainly, you know, I I put my hand up on the auth until work was going on to try my best to make you know, hold through which if he could fit there. But there's still more work to be done because the he is rotated. There's there's kind of unknown how we can kind of keep the the server up to date with these keys. There's no, like, answer there. And so you know, we can certainly define some stuff on specific side as to how these actions are supposed to look, but there's also, I feel like a few missing There's like a few gaps on the side as well.
