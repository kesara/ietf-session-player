So Ad hoc is now 9528. So well done, everybody. Yeah. It happened very recently, so I didn't, it didn't make it into the chair slides just yet. The first image of fireworks I found was Sydney, not Brisbane, but, yeah, You do your best. It's cool. I'm I'm actually going on holidays after o'clock today as most holidays begin. I will be heading ahead and sit in the okay. So with that, we Mhmm. Yeah. Well, I'm not I won't be, staying somewhere sender But we can chat. Okay. And the chair slides that don't include our ROC numbers, include the usual things. So my name is Steven Farrell. I'm one of the co Malisha is remote today. So Hello, folks. Yep. I'm here. So Melissa is on a, I think, in a, on a hotel Wi Fi or hotspot or some combination of those 2. So might disappear at some point. Which case, I'll try do my best. I'll try not to. I'll try not to. Okay. Thanks, Moshe. So this is the note. Well, I guess you've seen this probably if you've been at the IETF meeting all week. You know, You should note it well. You are you should have already. And not really well is to behave ourselves and be nice and This has not been a problem with this group, so that's fine.

We have an agenda Are some links, including the agenda, the meet echo, and minutes link. Status is out of date. Because we have 2 RSCs issued now. So Hawk And Traces are now RFCs. We had this candidate for working group adoption drafts, implementation considerations, but Marco has written There was no feedback. Received. So if some people could just send a mail to the list saying, yes, adopt this. That would be good for the record, I think. I don't think there was any issues with adopting it. People seem to like the work. But it would help be helpful for the record if people can say, yes, adopt it. Valid and silence. So please take you can take take a minute to do that now, even.

And I will do firstly, a very quick recap of the protocol. I'll just show off also quickly some updates on the implementation. Then I'll spend more time on the updates of the and some open issues and next steps. So recap lightweight authorization using ad hoc. Maybe I will be referring to this as just alt or even 0 touch. Network join or enrollment. So that's the way we commonly refer. The protocol. So we have a 3 device, 3 entities, the device, domain authenticator. Sometimes we also call it a gateway, and, enrollment server. U, V, and W. The device wants to enroll a domain, and we will use ad hoc for that. On top of that, we add, external authorization data. So that the device can request and obtain a voucher. If it's authorized, by the enrollment server. Oh, that's the me. Flow. Flow. Of the protocol As far a quick update on the implementation. Basically, you have the the the important thing here is that we have, the layouts, 00, it's fully implemented now. And we have a working demo in real hardware. So we are trying to validate the draft as we develop it."

And, after some discussion, we decided that it might be useful to be able to carry some encrypted data between you and w. So now the voucher is the ciphertext of a causing crypto 0 object. And, just a note that the ciphertext will contain, So even if the bank tax is empty, the market will be there. So it's it will be equivalent to the previous construction. So what kind of data? So let's discuss about, opaque inflow So we had a problem, where we identified that in certain situations, UNW may want to exchange information. For example, from you to w, maybe you want to send some context around it, example, the gateways that are nearby, from WQU, there are 2 scenarios For example, if it works, the if the voucher requests works, then maybe we want to inform you whether v is an owner with admin access or simply announce access provider, connectivity provider, or maybe if an error happened, maybe we want to send some extra information about the error. In our proposed solution, which is on version 1 of the draft. Is, to add, or back info. Field, that is encrypted between U and W. And here is an example of how use it. In the request.

We also added, mechanism for error handling So we defined a new ad hoc error called access denied and we define it as a generic error for Edlock. 1st. So we define, we are defining the error code. We define a specific, error content. And that can be, reject type where we can tag it. And, optionally, you can can have a reject info. And inside the reject info, we can have some of making information that the idea is to use it as actionable information about the error so that when you receive the error, it can do something about it. And, note that the addition of the opaque info here is something specific 2, like, odds. It's, not for general general, the general error case, of the EDOC error exit the night. Which we are defining in in this draft, but we think it might be useful could be used for in other scenarios. And, we will have an example of what could be in this of a handful in the next slide. Here, I will talk about enrollment hints. So the problem that we one problem that we identified was the following. If we look at the picture, We have device uone then 3 gateways. So if the the device tries to join via gateway V1 and then it fails and try to deal with 2. It fails again. And then, Malaysia, you want to speak? So we have here on in the queue.

So it means that they call to V2 it could have been spared if you one could have a hint about how to that it should reach, v3 after getting the first error from v 1. So the idea is to enable this kind of, hints in the protocols. So the first one is what we define it as a UHINT, with which enables you you and the device to tell the server which gateway is, it has a scanner. It has discovered. So And then the next hint is VINs where w may tell the device. Which gateway is it should use that it should be authorized if you should use So these hints are optional, and the idea is to speed up enrollment there are many V's available Yes. You're in Yeah. No. May maybe now is a good time. So I had a question about this use case here. What is it, So is it actually what why is why does it matter which gateway? Is there a load balancing here? What is the use? What is the use case for by by does it matter from Which gateway you choose? Okay. So, for example, will bring a use case in here if you have, a device inside the building and then this building, you have multiple access points. From multiple stakeholders and you want your device to join via your point, but the radius overlap So you want to to define your policies in W such that, the device is using a specific kind of gateway.

I just wonder if this is So this is the the idea here is that we are using the error code for something specific because it's actionable. Maybe that's a point worth we're highlighting here that the error code, the the so the current error codes are not are only actionable error codes. And what makes this actionable is actually that you have this relationship between you and w. So you can actually pass trust toward the information back to the client. So so that you'd, I mean, if if if you have an access error error codes or not, error, messages are not protected in general. But in this case, you can carry content which actually can be verified. And then you can act on on things like access denied. In in an automated way. That was just just to come. And I actually have a third question if if I if I may, on on on the next slide, that I think was a question by Steven or someone, saying that what is the privacy aspects of of gathering information about gateways now. That was indeed my question. So I think that's I think it's a good question. I just wondered, there is this a security consideration? Is this a, how do we handle that? I mean, you You are entitled to do some collection of information, and it it somewhat depends on what you do with that information, I suppose. Or does anyone have anything to add on that? So"

I think we need an answer To that question, Michael? Wish wish it was taller. So you is listening to the radio artel to get this list of, V1, V2, V3. And I, agree that its privacy information should are sensitive, should w decide to make it public or otherwise do interesting thing things that would be interesting to it. With that list. You on the other hand, can go and try and onboard via V1, V2, or V3. Each of which is going to effectively contact W Revealing w V1, V2, and V3. To the normal course of operation.

So As long as the peep the entities in the on the path, cannot view it So Random hobos on the internet cat, cat, see that list. I don't think it's as interesting or as sensitive as as there. That's what I'm saying. I I agree with you that there's information and that it's sensitive. But I'm saying the question is who are we disclosing it to and how long?

No. I mean, we we don't need to figure the answer today or right now.

As much of a problem as for other environments. So it might be that we find that this is actually useless, not very useful in the end. Possible Right? Okay. Great. Thanks. Okay. Thank you very much.

This actual second one demonstrates, narrow case when the device selects the error wrong gateway and also illustrates how the information about the, the hints, about the gateway, can be sent as part of the error message. Now I proceed to some open issues. Number 19 is to explain the error in the V rack VRS protocol. So right now, what we define it is the expedited error that goes into the ad hoc interaction, the blue box on the left and we need to define on the the red box in the right So what happens in this kind of, in the interaction between V and W So this is next next steps. We have issue number 21. Which, is about odds with inverted adocrows. So that means So, normally, u is the initiator and v is the responder. And then the issue the question that arose is Should we invert that and I mean, should it be possible to be inverted? So I just did a quick, sketch of how this could look. And the question was about if it is something was fundamentally preventing this I don't think so. I think the main question is how much it is needed. Someone has a use case for this I'm not sure. And then, there are a few issues that I opened because I was thinking, if we could make the info, less opaque. And what I mean by that is to try to be more concrete So this is an exploration that I'm doing if it makes sense or not. So let's focus on number 23 here."

On the other hand, we don't know if maybe the device wants to send more context that a different kind of context flow information that will help W and make this decision.

We can discuss there are some stale issues. That are still open. And my suggestion is to close but I think we can discuss them, in the issue attack it. So as a final wrap up, we have the implementation closely following the draft say, close me, marks because we implemented version 00, and we are just releasing 01 We have, any ways to share information between you and We have a new ad hoc error code, and we have some open issues"

And, yeah, to recap why we started to do to do this work. Well, Eduardo has defined the concept of application profiles as a set of information that, business was to be aware of, in advance to ensure that, even on top of possible, negotiations during the political execution, they can, complete it successfully. Of course, it leaves it open, other side questions on how to enable or, to some extent, facilitate the the discovery, the use, even the the definition of education profiles. And, some thoughts in that direction started already, last year, in a core document that to some limited, very core specific and, was addressed. But, on the general topic, it was preferred to move this. To the recording group that ended up even to be, trapped in a sentence that I'm quoting here. From the charter. Taking into account, the scope of this document is, multidimensional, but it really starts with, defining 3 were to, register integer identifiers pointing to predefined, and the registered, error application profiles.

To avoid confusion. And in turn evolves into, obstructing away from any, context applications set up and some, and the findings that the canonical represent of how an application profile, looks like, preferably using the seaboard they taught him.

This is an example of a few things I mentioned before. If you consider for example, the, web link case, and, register existing work some application process was registered with identify your 500 you can indicate in a link that a certain, a resource the server is supporting profile 500, whatever it says, and that's, of course, more efficient than what is done in the same example.

This is just because I'm worried that otherwise there would be, kind of wild registration of, the application profiles that are very similar with one another with the only difference that they they support, possibly overlapping subsets, of the ID items, and there will be just a a waste of registrations.

So so that means that it's I think it's kind of safe. So you could have you could have profiles which are completely defined including certain I Eighty items. And if you support that, then, I mean, then you only use that identified profile ID for for for that. And then if you want to add things on top of that that's those could be specified with with the web link. Yeah.

It's not that I expect a a crazy registration of cipher seats and so on, but the items are different. Christian. Do EAD items need to be spelled out in this camera in the first place. I mean, they do have a distinction between being optional and being mandatory. So is that not an extension point that can be used to out for the negotiation. Yeah. The labels are only positive. Then you may have them switch to negative only on the wire. Yes. But that is that my point is an ad a user of ad hoc can, if something is really optional, can put them in there in an optional way, so they don't have to be all agreed on in the first place. But they can be negotiated as they as the epochs changes going along.

For So to verify and confirm the integrity and trust missed of a remote device or system, we need to do the remote attestation. And the process for the remote attached attestation has 3 roles. The attach which is coordinating and entrusted state and needs to generate the evidence about itself. The work order is the entity that evaluate the evidence and generate the attestation result. The the result and generates, and generates a level of trust and decide what to do with the and the architecture for doing the remote station has been defined and standardized by the working progress And there are 2 types. 1 is the background check model and the other is passport model. So my current focus is on the background check model. Which the relying party is responsible to transfer the plaintiff's with the, verifier and get the at the the best session result back from the verifier. And the first version of the dress has just been released it defines how to do the remote attestation procedure using the EAD fields at talk. So the general overflow is like the, firstly, the attheaster set the attesting proposal to the relay party, which contains all the provided at these types, and the verifier can select the end and types that it can support. And the right here is that the relying party also has some knowledge about the attester. So it can narrow down the selection to only one end step"

And mapping this to ad hoc session, the testor, will collocate as the role initiator of, and the Reliability will locate the row as the responder. The river is currently out of scope in this specification. The relation, between the reliability and the should be a web based trust. And the session could be, like, either TLS or at talk pass o score, but currently it's column scope. So back to the ad hoc session, the 3 year deb, values has been defined as attestation proposal, but session request and the evidence. And, points that I want to discuss here is for the labels. Particularly for the, criticality of edibles. My initial idea is that E81 is not critical. Because if the initiator sent the authorization proposal, and he, responder if it cannot handle or recognize the the decision proposal, the whole ad hoc session could be, still be continued but for ed2anded3 they should be critical because once the responders send back the attestation request, it means that the re attestation need to be continued. So if the initiator cannot handle or, recognize the assistant request, the whole ad hoc action should be aborted. And the same for EAD3 if the initiator has already sent"

So for example, in the PSA draft, it will indicate precisely that The claims will be, in CWT, which is a format of EAT token. And the profile of VAT is for PSA tokens And for you, the 2 it will, contains only one integer as the content form ID, which is selected by running party and supported by the welfare. And the Ninesis generate generated by the verifier, which is 8264 bytes long. And forwarded by the right party. And for ed3, It is a serialized entity a attestation token, which contains the attested claim site to describe the state and characteristics of an entity. And in, one clip in the EAT called EAT profile, will indicate the choices made for the implementation options. As we don't want to carry all of the AT claims inside the message.

But then, like, how how do you do the attestation? Like, the the verify role is, I believe the most important part that going to do the verification or the appraisal process. So without that, how would you complete the protocol in itself? Like, if if you don't have that present policy. If you don't have the verified role, So I don't believe that you are actually doing that the station completely. So it doesn't make sense to me. So I'm not sure one other alternative in my opinion could be that that, verifier is co located with the responder itself. That is the that's the very fine line party as it's called in the rec architecture. Not really called that way, but that's the understanding behind that a a kind of intuition that the line party is school located with or the verified school located with the with the relying party. So I believe that would make more sense rather than saying that it's out of scope. So I I'm not sure whether that was the intention. Because, will make sense to me how would otherwise, it it at a station process itself complete without, how would the protocol itself I mean, proceeds a little saying a major entity, a core entity out of scope is not, correct.

And 2 of the main issues is with PSK authentication, typically has quite bad, privacy properties, at least when you use external long term PSK identifiers, then you basically have something you can use crack and identify the device. Which is bad. Then, of course, if you have a fixed MAC address, it might not matter, but you should probably not have that. Then PSK key exchange is also quite bad. Secured properties, you don't get perfect forward secrecy. Has some other good properties also like content resistance and so on. But You should not do yes PSK key exchange without difficult man all the time. Next slide. So the plan is to start writing a draft on this. And I think the Yeah.

As long as you have some, goals for how and you need to do an initial handshake. In in SSH, just as an example, this is like 1 hour 1 gigabyte you need to do if I'm wrong with the camera. Then, how do we solve the privacy problems for for the resumption, it's quite quite easy, you drive a new resumption PSK for each. Resumption. The rhyming a key is quite, is very cheap on this. If you get problem. You only send it once. And if you get a problem, you you probably have to you can maybe retry on the same connection or something, but If things fail, then you do a new initial handshake. The biggest and probably hardest problem to solve is how do you get privacy in the initial handshake assuming you have some external PSK and you have some PSK identified something this, the same kiosk identifier in each connection all the time is is if, from multi mode.

One one solution that you could do if you don't have so many devices is, trial decrypt So you're basically you don't send the PSK identifier at all. You have sent some Mac or something, you let the responder try all the PS external PSK it has. I'm doing decryption is much, much cheaper than doing asymmetric to see if you could try quite a lot of keys until you get to the same costs as doing an asymmetric operation.

I in in this case, it would identify the initiator also, which we protect, it would be If you have a PSK identifier in the first message, you get, you don't get any privacy, both the initiator and the on that doesn't get privacy against a passive attacker. Yep. But why does the PSK ID need to be in the first message? Can be in the second message as it is in the in in in ad hoc so far. I guess it. It can, but then you need to change the roles, then I I typically want the, initiate to maybe to initiate and also provide a PSK, of course, you can reverse the world.

It will be negotiated who is authenticated to whom what crypto systems are used and and and also that strength of the, of the, of the crypto systems. Like for example, you can do keeps change with, with, this is 2 56 with elliptic curve group, but also with larger groups So there is a lot of, of, of, of, of runtime decisions, negotiation, going on during the handshake and that adds to the complex of the protocol because depending on, on these negotiations you can have 100, if not 1000, of different execution paths. And this and noise basically tries to avoid runtime decisions And instead, move them design time decisions which means, it has already need to or it needs already be decided design time. For example, who gets authenticated to whom which cryptographic algorithms are used and so on and so forth. There is still a very simple negotiation face at the beginning of the handshake. But then after this simple negotiating face, the whole protocol becomes a straight sequence of messages of and operation.

I suppose some of you are familiar visit on however signatures may still be needed in the form of certificates be needed for binding, the static keys to do an identity.

And they can even be encrypted as as as least as if at least one, if your Alvin operation has already been carried out, Of course, these early payloads, have probably less security guarantees and the payloads that you sent after the handshake But for some applications, it can still be useful to have these early payloads.

However, as I said, for authenticated encryption and hashing can also be done with single low level primitive namely cryptographic permutation that you operate either in sponge mode or in complex mode depending on whether you want to hash or perform authenticated encrypt in in some sense, you can see this the state of the permutation is a stateful object where the output does not only depend on the current input, but it also depends in in the sound sense on all all the preceding inputs.

I, as you, if I understand correctly, you use thing. Seashake Now, or at least that's what's true busy. Yes. So so stroke, initially, it uses it uses the catch up permutation. Catch up in terms of state size, it's not super friendly for for really resource constrained devices. Also when you think, you know, that the mess are usually short, have a state of 1600 bytes So so if you encrypt them on the, a 1600 bits 200 bytes. If you encrypt only a few bytes, you still have to to to the food permutation on the 1600 bit state So, we used we used, Because CUDA is quite a bit faster than ask com. I understand that people are now interested in Ascom because it it's becoming the standard, but but CUDA turned out to be quite"

And Therefore, I'm not a big fan Ascom. really of of Okay. it's okay. to the list or in the chat? So Could thanks. You're you take you're on it Yes. Yes. Yes. So Thanks. Great. Thanks again, Yohan. And again, You stay on to the list. So you know how to contact have to him. Giovanna, you wanted to send us some wonderful video or something? Yes, please. What's the best way I send you the link or I share my screen? Share your screen. Okay. So we have, like, 6 minutes left. I hope if that's enough for you, Grace. Yes. Of course, my video is 3 minutes. I asked him to share the screen. Do I need to give you approval? Permissions. And the stars. I have to give you permission. Video published do I find that? I appear in the queue Just after John with the hand, but I am With the screen share, Yes. One second. Grant screen. There you go. Great. Something is happening? I you hope Hope you can see this. Yep. Great. So I will, do a voice over. I think it will be easy Okay. So this is a demonstration. Lightweight authorization using ephemeral deferment overcosa, which I"

    "text": "just presented the updates. A few moments ago. We are using a platform called dotbot, which is a used to use macrobot for educations and research purposes on top of which we developed the demonstration. For the dot bot, we have at the, gateway, which can be used to control the 1 or more robots it uses, like, a broadcast messaging. So we go back to the specification and we look into that diagram. Where we have device you. In the in the case of the demo, I have 2 devices. Device number 1 and device number 2. We also have the specification, domain indicator, or So here we have a gateway and the communication between devices and gateways is Bluetooth. In this case, we are using, only the physical layer of Bluetooth. And we also need an enrollment server or a w. So we have here the dotbot Manager And, we have, access control list. Which allows only that what number 1 to join this, domain. And we also can inspect the authorization log when the devices try to join the network. Okay. So I'll go ahead and connect to the logs of my gateway. And I will turn the first device device 1 I will turn it on. So it sends a a doc message to the gateway, with the EAD field, which is related to the botbot Manager and As you can see, it is, authorized in the page. Just a little time so the video flows. of And then the voucher is sent back as part Message 2. And the device is now authorized into the domain, and it's part of the network. Of my gateway."

    "text": "I'll try to do the same with device number 2. And as you can see, it has been already unauthorized And the reason is that because it's not in the access control list, So normally, when the devices are connected to the gateway, when I press the buttons, the broadcast message would make all of them move in the same way, but since only one was authorizing. It when I try to send the commands, only device 1 will respond. Because only one received the voucher, and therefore, only device 1 join you the domain of gateway the other implementation, specifically the adult implementation and all implementation is available open source, and we also have the W implementation also available online. And that's the demo. Thank you. Great. What's up? Thanks, Giovanni, and thanks for doing it in time. I I yeah. Good luck. Clap for demo. And maybe maybe you can do a live demo next time if we're in the in the same vicinity. With that, I think that we Got your agenda. Thanks, everyone. We have follow-up on the list as usual with everything, and now I'm on holidays. Bye bye. I'm afraid so Thank you so much. Thanks. Bye bye. Enjoy your holiday. Thank you all. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye. And it covers everyone to the publication."
