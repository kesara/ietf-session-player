This is an IAB meeting, but we are part of the IETF So the note well applies similar as in every meeting. That's might not have any discussion that impact IPR rights, but this is an important part. But also be aware of the code of conduct and let's have a nice session. Probably you've seen the slides also a couple of times. So everybody in the room should join the meet echo client in order to have a record about who was here, important for send us thing. Then remote participants, you're very welcome to, have your video when you're talking, but otherwise, you should not join with the video probably. And also if you wanna join the queue, then you have to use a meet echo client. Next slide. This is IB Open. What is IB basically, their two points here. One is we wanna report out a little bit what we're doing. And the other one is also we wanna Get feedback from you. If you have any questions that we can't answer today, you can always send an email. Be aware the IAB email list also has a couple of people who are not the core IAB members and we have a bunch of other email lists. So we have architect to discuss for more discussions. We have program email list, and we have a separate list for any questions regarding Leason Collination. And that's the agenda for today. Yeah. We basically went through the work already. We have an update from Charles about, 3 g p, just a little bit of an overview,"

Joining us as well. Then we have the invite to talk by Vanessa. Where we have hopefully a lot of time for questions and interesting discussion. Okay? Alright. So then quickly going through some of the things, that Ivy has done recently that you may wanna to read up on first, we have some document updates we have a couple RFCs that have been published since last time. These are both IAB workshop reports. And so you can hear about the environmental impact workshop as well as the M10 workshop on, managing encrypted encrypted traffic and networks, We also have a document that we have approved for publication that's with the RFC editor. On, a technical topic about partitioning as an architecture for privacy, and this is looking at the common trend we see across things like mask, and oblivious HTTP, etcetera, as a way to achieve privacy. And we also have a new document, which is the workshop report for bias and you'll be hearing about that IBM also has a couple technical programs, which are, kind of open discussion areas, And we have 2 going on right now. We have the EDM program, which is evolveability, deployability, maintainability, This is a program that has produced a couple RFCs, previously. And we have one current work item, which is looking at how to better specify and provide advice on how to use greasing and variability in protocols.

So we did have a virtual inter meeting. So we had a kickoff in, Prague, and we had a virtual intermeeting Yaris also here. If you want to have for the questions for us. And so we had, like, kind of 2 teams going through the meeting. And it was like a really nice set of interim meetings, and we identified some short term work that can start in the ETF And the, opportunities, r in the loop, and they know, like, this they can charter some work soon. So probably that might be above. In this area, at the next meeting, and we will continue to solicit, like, more topics and kind of keep running this as virtual interims. Keeping with the theme of, being green. So Thank you very much. And like, please contact us for any questions you Alright. Thank you, Sarash. So moving on from our programs. One of the things that the IB does is it also manages the the liaison relationships, with other SDOs. One, notable layouts on statement that the IV issued recently. Was in response to the confidential computing consortium. We essentially have had a dialogue there about some statement on the use of attestation and the impact on the open internet So if you're interested in that, please do, read that.

Hi, everyone. I'm I'm Charles Echol. I'm the, IETF liaison manager to 3 GPP. And, then on the right hand side, you have, Peter Schmidt. He's my counterpart on 3gpp side, access the liaison manager to IITF. And so just to give you an overview on the IOTF3gppcoordination. Next slide, please. Through HPP, the the focus there is on mobile communications. Hundreds of companies from around the world. It's, come together to work on standards, much like here, contribution driven and consensus based, Also, I think it's kinda similar to here. The way it's it's organized or the way the technical work is is organized. Much like we have areas and then working groups within each of those areas. So three has these technical specification groups. That cover different aspects of the 3 g p v."

So within each of those, areas or TSGs, you have multiple different working groups. And that's where actually the bulk of the technical work gets done. Now now then what gets a little bit different from the way we're organized is the the TSGs or the areas they all meet together four times a year. At, at meetings where they're they're co located in together. The working groups on the other hand They meet in between those meeting cycles. And they can meet once or twice and they may or may not be co load located with other working groups. So when you're working with, you have liaison say you're exchanging back and forth with through GPP Working Groups, you need to you know, be a little bit more careful, maybe looking at the schedule and see exactly when they're meeting with other for meetings, because it's not quite as straightforward as what we have here. Let's see. The other thing was, so the TSGs, that's where most of coordination activity, happens. And so when I getting, later on into the liaisons you'll see when liaison statements if you're exchanging liaison statements directly with a working group, you can just talk directly to them, when it involves more than one working group then that gets coordinated at the the TSG level. And so that can impact as well the the speed and with which you, you may be able to exchange that information. Next slide, please. And another thing I thought might be useful, just the way, you look at, through GPP specifications. Of course, there's a lot of them. They all have a specific format. So they start with a couple letters, TS or TR,"

    "startTime": "00:10:00",
    "text": "the TS's, those are the technical specifications, whereas the TR our technical reports. We're primarily focused, on the the normative work or the technical vacations, However, it's good to kind of be, you know, mindful of what's happening in the technical reports, because even those are those are informative, they can also often the outcome of that. Just kind of feeds directly into one of the technical specifications. After those first two letters, then there's 2 digits. That's a series number. Kinda gives you an idea of the general area of the standards that you're working with and then a 3 digit kind of unique ID after that. Next slide, please. So the coordination activities that that we have, first of all, we have within the IAB, there's a, a group created for the coordination activity with 3gpp we meet at each of these IETF meetings, to talk about what's going on there, see if there's anything that that we need to address and just kinda get an update on status. Similarly, at each of those TSG meetings that happens four times a year. There is a a report on, IETF status that's given to 3 g PP. So that's kind of the main way in which we coordinate. In addition to that though, our primary focus is on liaison statements. And, dependency tracking. I'll talk a bit about each of those a bit more The areas in which, like, we seem to have overlap and and really need to coordinate. It's mainly around, transport and security, and then Yang, both as a a modeling language but also individual yang models. Next slide, please. So it'll fill out as on statements. Typically, we're exchanging these between IETF working groups and 3 GPP working groups. Although, as I mentioned before, if it's something that involves more than 1, 3gpp working group. It it it"

    "text": "it gets coordinated at the TSG level. The way, 3gpp meetings work, everything is based on contributions. So there'll be, like, 100 of contributions for a given meeting. And incoming and outgoing liaisons are just, their their their meeting contributions as well. Just like we have a very specific format for seeing internet 3gpp has a very specific format for meeting contributions. So when we're exchanging liaisons with them, it's really important that we format them and a specific way so that 3 GPP is able to to deal with them. And for that reason, if you have you know, some information you want to exchange through a a liaison statement we just request the the working group chairs that they work, you know, directly with with me and with Peter. And we'll help you just to make sure that the formatting's correct and that we engage the right working groups on the 3 gpp side. A next slide, please. And then just an example to kinda run through this a little bit. I won't go into, great detail on this, but this was A liaison statement sent from TSBWG to a couple different, through GPP groups, both the SA 1 sorry, SA 3 and ran 3. And, very important that we state whether it's for action or informational. In this case, it was for action. And when it is, you need to give a a deadline by which the that action needs to be done. By through GPP. Then the other really important thing I wanna point out is the attachment. And that attachment is going to essentially be the basis of the meeting that I mentioned earlier. Next slide, please. Here we see on the right hand side that that is that attachment. And it's formatted with all the information that 3gpp expects and you know, with the right headers and that that that they're looking for."

In this case, it was going to SA 3, so that's why you see it begins with an S 3 and then a a document ID number. Next slide, please. So, then coming back to us, this was the response from, SA 3. To our liaison statement to them. So you can see it's coming from SA 3. It's sent back to TSBWG And the purpose here, it stated as being for informational and there's an attachment here too. And that attachment is what you see on the right hand side. And so in the 3 g p meeting, This contribution was put together. It was discussed. It was edited. It was you know, rubbed a few times and eventually it got agreed and then that was what was sent to us in response. As a response LS. Next slide, please. Now, dependencies So in addition to the the liaison statements, the other main thing we do is is is look dependencies And what these dependencies are is, dependencies, within 3gpp specifications on IETF documents. So as you can imagine, within a 3 g p spec, There's lots of references to other 3 g p p specs but they they also, sometimes reference non 3 g p p specs, like And those could be IATF RFCs, or it could be, in some cases, working group drafts or or even individual drafts. Now now the preference there is that it's a a published RFC, but in the case not, if it's a working group draft or an individual draft, then we track that very closely. And try to, you know, shepherd it along until it becomes an RFC. Or if say it's not going well. It's not gonna get adopted by the working group. That we communicate that very clearly with 3gpp So there's not kind of this, you know, false understanding of, oh, hey, you know, did you be, ITF's working on this? We can rely on it."

And if needed, we'll we'll send an LS back and forth Otherwise, we can kinda just work and have you know, people work in both 3 GPP and IETF. And just make sure that that goes, smoothly. Oh, yeah. And I I mentioned earlier the TS's and the TRs, the TS's being the normative applications, That's the only place where we track the dependencies. As soon as, a reference to an IETF draft. Finds its way into one of these These TSs, the normative work, That's when we track it k. Next slide, please. Okay. And I just wanna leave you with a few links on the 3 gpp side. Is where you can find out more information about through GBT, and then also the corresponding, you know, links related to this relationship the on the IHS side. That's it. If there's any questions, Yep. Thanks a lot. So, think actually having these slides is a very useful resource. We also have this for a bunch of other liaisons. So thank you for providing them to us. Yeah. Any questions? Yes. Church. George Michaels and IP, Nick. There is a conversation going on about Eurasia of drafts and the potential to have drafts can exists in longer lifetimes. It's not that I think it's appropriate for another the O to refer to a non published document, but if the concern in reference the draft is that they disappear. There's potential for this conversation about what is the natural face of a draft. I do think it's better they refer to a published document, but I'm just observing there is a conversation about this. Okay. Yeah. No. I I think the concern is more about they reference something that doesn't have IETF consensus, why they believe they reference something that actually is sending it for me. I saw the concerns that it is new mutable,"

So, Josh, like to your point, right, like, the 3 g b p has, like, some kind of deadline driven releases. So they have a date by which something needs to get done. So they usually come to us and say, like, hey. Is this draft stable? Right? And they sometimes they just copy and paste the whole text in. Just to make that release, but they actually update it to the published RFC at some future point so that like, generally, the right things happen because you have a pretty a nice coordination relationship between the 2. But, yeah, that's like something, because of a timeline. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, you know, important that once the RFC does get, you know, in the good case where it gets published, we need to go back and and we make sure that we do the right cleanup work on the side to actually replace the references to those drafts. With references to RFCs. Alright. Okay. Great. Thanks, everyone. Thank you so much, Charles. And next, we're gonna quickly cover arm Bias Workshop. In the report. Hi, everyone. So we have our workshop report 00 version out. Let me could be talk to you about, what happened at the workshop next slide.

We all know community networks are self organize networks, which are another alternative to commercial Internet services that we rely on. And in some part of the world's community networks play a very critical role. So the discussion mainly revolves around how do we measure quality of user experience in community networks, looking at various operational and managerial considerations in managing community networks, a very interesting discussion what is the role of CDNs in, in this space, which which was quite interesting. Again, these days satellite networks, we know would play a quite important role in, in community networks as well. And finally, spectrum role of spectrum in this space was also discussed. Thank you. Next step, next slide, please. So digital divide this was audited by Mallory it asked what are the disparities in internet access and services. Where are the gaps? And what are the different factors that needs to be analyzed in this space? The 3 key aspects that were discussed were looking at various population demographics, and seeing how different their experiences on internet was inequality in in multilingual and domains and email addresses and also the cost of mobile data access the size of our websites and what is the correlation All of this was pretty interesting discussion. But overall, we did realize that these covers only very limited set of factors when it comes to digital divide, and this discussion is waived"

It looked at how the legal control and suppression of internet access, of mobile apps, of websites, internet shutdowns, How those have been done? We had very good reports on how censorship has been done in some part of the world? What are the tools being used, to do that? And measuring this content, which was quite interesting. The special focus was in two places, looking at what's happening at Russia and India. Next slide. I think that will show you some of the ideas of examples of the reports that we got. This was done by Simone, looking at only measurements, especially during the Ukraine Russia war, what was happening with the news websites from Ukraine and how they were blog, what would the technique use, etcetera, next slide, which shows some of the key findings from this report, and the timeline as well as various different interesting information that was very useful for the workshop participant. Next slide. Another one was from India, looking at 3 different IS is what are the different mechanisms they use when online censorship is done in India and how un uniform It is how the same blocked content uh-uh, could be visible from one ISPs while not visible from others. Sometimes it's just arbitrary with no legal information available to the person where the content been blocked. So this was also quite interesting to look at Next slide.

But from our technical community, what else guidance that we could provide was one of the suggestions, we also had, should our documents when they talk about manageability consideration? Are they specific consideration looking at community networks, which might be very different from commercial networks. That should be looked at. It should be easy to operate even for folks who are doing community network stuff, with digital divide, the main consensus was that we need to identify. What are the few areas where we will have a significant impact because this problem space is so where we will have the most effective and inclusive internet, those solutions and those key areas we need to focus on. We need to continue to work on enhancing our product protocols that privacy, is key. As well as how we can have censorship. Circumvention tools available, do we measure them? And this discussion at the IAB workshop is usually the starting point And this kind of discussion should continue some of the, the pointers that we provided was to our various from research groups there was in fact, some early discussion if a very censorship focused mailing list or a research group could be form, but these things are pretty early on. And, anyway, the aim diabetes workshop is to bring in a more diverse set of and voices in the room, and hopefully that leads to more work in the IETF and IRTF in general"

So is that described in the report, or can you point me to somewhere that it points to the right RFC where you can learn about it. It's in fact Okay.

Few things that I noticed that I'm not I I'm sorry. I didn't have time yet. Review the report. It was just impossible.

And there are nothing of professional people here. That was that was one thing that I don't know if it has been fully documented in the report, but would be my feedback to the report. That's okay. The second is that I don't know how many times We had a discussion at nearly every single partition on the term cybersecurity. And so I know that, Drew, you made it right. On your side of the second one, there were plenty of technical issues. I remember this because this is a passion for me, but I I you reported that correctly, but you just I was surprised how much time it came. I wonder if you should not have a second look at this one from that you. The third one was a shock. Shocking the censorship was when I think Mona explained the study that was remarkable on how she measured and she figured out that there were some commercial enterprise class proxies used to lose censorship. And I could find a list of my competitors over there. And I was absolutely ashamed. Could not believe it. Even technically, I could not believe that this could even be possible. So I followed that with, and we we discussed that. I I figured out that that they are simplest seeing that the vendors could do to avoid this situation and this is the follow-up. Maybe we should have on that because they are people who are in this room, I would be ashamed if I would see the name of my company in this That's it. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you a very good point. A lot of, commercial systems are used to have all these filtering techniques and whatever. And these are the same techniques that actually used for censorship. If"

In this context of trustee for the Inset Watch Foundation I just thought it was worth saying that, the definition of censorship is sort of the legally mandated blocking of content. Clearly there is some content that I've hope most of us at least in this room would be quite comfortable, is is legally blocked. And I just feel slightly uncomfortable that if we look at techniques to bypass, censorship, we may actually be facilitating, the further explosion of access to, for example, child sex abuse material by bypassing controls, which of air for a purpose to, sort of stop that sort of exploitation and protect the human rights. Of children. So, you know, whilst you know, censorship can be a problem. I think we definitions here matter, and the definition on on the slide is extremely broad. In my view. Yeah. So we have an Not sure you had a real question. Or it it was just to say that as framed. I've got concerns that we're going down a a difficult path as a community, that will cause problems that we wouldn't want to be take we wouldn't want to take responsibility for So, and this is not part of the workshop, but there is an RFC, which is the research group RC that actually defines censorship very broadly. So that discussion happened already. But what we also recognize at the workshop is that I think we need more discussion in space. So it's ongoing and, there are a lot of things. There are also a lot of things we all need to learn about what's going on in the world. So I'm very much interested to to continue that his discussion is Thank you everyone. Do read the report.

Hasn't delayed So I'm gonna cover Five main areas today. Are can see the list on the slide here. Let's move on So quick overview, thread is a wireless networking technology. It's designed to be very low power, I have some magnetic door and window sensors made by Eve they run off a half sized double a battery, and I think Eve claims a year battery life in my experience, I get close to 2. And if you're running those things with wifi, you'd be changing the battery every week. The hardware is really cheap. You can buy developer kits, in quantities of 1 for around $10 and probably much less than that in volume if you're building it into products. Data rate is a quartermegabitper2nd No. So it's much slower than wifi. And that accounts for its much lower power consumption after you take the overheads into account, maybe a 100 kilobits per second, useful throughput. And if you're going multiple hops through the mesh,"

So the the cost The range the power consumption and the performance here is very similar to bluetooth low entry, or ZigBee, and indeed, Thread uses the same. I Tripoli 802.15.4 hardware. That Zigbee uses. The difference is that thread from the start fully embraces IP. Some of these other technologies are designed to be completely separate. Barely acknowledging that IP exists. This is the overall architecture. At the hardware layer, we have Hi. Tripoli 82.15.4. Radios, that send 128 byte frames, they operate in the same 2.4 gigahertz unlicensed spend that Bluetooth and wifi use. This is nice for product vendors because you can make a single product sell it worldwide. You don't have to build different versions for different countries. On top of that, we run ipv6 using 6 low pan and depart the thread group ads is a self configuring, self healing mesh, because 6 low pan is a point to point 1 hop framing, it defines how you encapsulate V Six packets over the 154 radios. What thread ads is to put multiple of these together to make a mesh. What's interesting about that is many of us today using Wi Fi and buying range extenders or similar technology because we want good Wi Fi coverage everywhere in the house. Because"

So, The more thread devices you add to your house, You're not overloading your network the way you might with Wi Fi. Actually, the more thread devices you add, the more you strengthen the network and the more redundant paths you create and the better coverage you create over the whole house. So thread creates a mesh. There's a key technology, which is that mesh is not of use if you can't communicate with it. So thread has a device called a thread border router. Which you can think of as being somewhat analogous to a WiFi access point, But there are some differences. If we just bridged Wi Fi and ethernet onto thread. The even a modest amount of multicast traffic on your giga Ethernet would be more than enough to completely flood the thread mesh, and it will stop working. So Whereas with wifi, the packet formats are similar. The MTU of 1500 bytes is compatible. The 14 byte ethernet heads were the same. You can bridge ethernet and wifi together, and that works really well. That would be a complete disaster with Fred. So We looked at this, and decided that IPV 6, had a lot of benefits here. And the IITF has been working on ipv6 for a long time. Adoption has gone very slowly, but we didn't approach this as some kind of religious dogma that wanna do V Six just because We looked at the cave built is that ipv6 provides that aren't there in other protocols and weren't there in ipv4.

So when you by one of these devices, which is how which has thread border out of functionality. It does these things automatically. And a thread border router is typically not something you buy as a dedicated device, like you might buy a WiFi access points, its functionality built into other products. A lot of people already have. If you're looking at automating your home with smart thermostats and light switches and things then It's probably the kind of household where you may have a smart speaker or something like that. So The threadboard router functionality is built into the Apple HomePods, Apple TV, It's in the Google Homehub Max. It's in Amazon Lexa. I'm probably forgetting other ones. So Many people just in the course of buying products that would buy anyway get this border out of functionality as a side effect. And most customers don't even know they have it. It's just something there that works with it and they need it. And in order to do the V Six routing, Our first choice is DHCP V6 prefix delegation. Where your ISP gives you full global V Six service, give you a slash 56, your home gateway, can then subdivide that and allocate slash 64s to networks within your house that need it. That's great when it works, but we also need a fallback when it doesn't, And The short summary of that is If you're a smart speaker,"

So you can now assign you self a V Six address. That's larger scope than the link local you already have. And it does the equivalent on the thread side, and it publishes route information off and this telling all the devices on the Wi Fi network If you want to reach a destination in this prefix, on thread network, I'm your router for that. So don't send it to the default gateway. Don't send it to your home gateway provided by the ISP. Send those packets to me because I know how to forward them. All of this framework was defined in ipv6 and we're able to make use of it. And then the other thing that threat offers is commissioning. Because in the early days of Wi Fi, you would type in the password on the screen on the device. But, light bulbs and light switches and things often don't have a screen. So thread also from the start, has mechanisms for doing that commissioning in a secure and trustworthy way. So thread is an ipv6link layer.

From CSA, the connectivity standards alliance, Matter is a home automation protocol unlike ZigBee and Z wave and things like that. Matter fully embraces IP. The previous code name for matter was Chip connected home over IP. So it's got IP right there in the name. And because of that, you can run matter over ethernet. You can run it over wifi, and you ticket thread network in, you can run it over thread unchanged. Other industry groups in the commercial building automation space like Dali, which goes lighting.

And the naming and the syntax is very similar. But instead of flooding multicast to everybody, devices offering services register with a service registry using a unicast registration and devices that want a query send unicast queries to that registry And then once they're subscribed, they get continuous change note occasions as things come and go that they're interested in that is work that's going on in the ATF.

Secondly, there there's no out. For technical and feasibility. Which I find bizarre because this strikes me as an extremely challenging technical problem. Right?

Unfortunately, the word hash is used it's not in any way similar to a cryptographic hash option. It's in fact, it has almost the opposite desired properties.

Well, then there's there's 2 obvious directions to ask about what somebody might do to attack such a system. The first attack is evasion, obviously. Suppose that somebody wants to share an image that they suspect is on the list of forbidden materials So they want to share something that looks like the image, but they want to modify the image in a way that the hash will be different. This obviously isn't supposed to happen. But various works of which this is the most recent example show that in an adversarial context, It's really not very hard. Even just with black box access, to the implementation of the perceptual hash function So evasion in the sense of trying to make a picture that really looks very similar, but actually has a completely different perceptual hash.

These kinds of evasions are going to defeat per central hash based. Detection. Okay. So that that's one direction, if you like, of attack. Trying to make an image that looks the same that has a different hash, and now the obvious dual tech is. Okay. Let's try to make two images that look different. But have the same hash. Now for a cryptographic hash function, remember this is supposed to be extremely hot. And, we believe, at least I believe that with something shutter 56. It's very, very hard to get 2 different things that make the same hash. For perceptual hash functions, it it doesn't have that security property. Right? And it's interesting that it is often assumed in the broader public discussion that it kinda sorta has that property. But it does not. And so there there's extensive research of which these two examples are are the most recent and comprehensive that looks both at accidental collisions in larger databases. Of images and also at deliberate manipulations of images. That can cause to images to have the same hash even when the images look very different to a human. So if you can't read the fine print, but you can see the picture, on the left, we have a photo of a political protest. And the assumption is, you know, this is something that somebody wants to send without being detected.

So private set intersection has been a thing in the cryptographic literature. For many years, long long before this particular application occurred to anybody. These protocols are really cool if you like this sort of thing, which I do. And they're they're the kind of nifty crypto that seems almost magical. Unless you're accustomed to looking at the mathematical details. So the setting is something like this, although there are lots of flavors in the literature.

The picture would look something like this. Assume that we have some kind of trusted source of the perceptual hashes of known illegal material. So on the left, somebody like the National Center for missing and exploited children or lease or somebody is gonna supply the service providers. With a list of perceptual hashes of forbidden items. The user device is going to have an implementation of the same perceptual hash function, So when they're about to send a picture or something. Gonna apply that perceptual hash function. That's gonna give them, a set of numbers. And then the service provider and the user are supposed engage in a private set intersection protocol in which the service provider learns how many or which something learns about the intersection between what was on the user's device?

And the 3rd possibility is that external attackers might use the clash properties of perceptual hash functions to include things to get things into the database were not actually things the Australian authorities intended to include. And so this is the attack that I explained badly when we were looking at the picture of the the puppy dog in the protest. But the attack would go something like this. Imagine that you imagine that a malicious party wants to figure out Which Australians are sharing photographs of Techman? So they a hash function to generate a let's say, an image of te glorifying terrorism or something that is illegal in Australia, that has the same perceptual hash as tank man. They make sure that this offensive image comes to the attention of the Australian authorities who with the best of intentions load it into their database of forbidden images. And now everybody who shares a photo of tank man gets flagged. So I am not in any way the first person to identify those kinds of issues, And the proponents of these systems have a number of attempts at defense. 1 is in fact, Apple when they first introduced their private center section, system said that they'd have a sort of secondary check by a human before there was any kind of automated detection the place. But that actually doesn't solve the problem. It actually doesn't solve any of these really. If, for example, the image is a sexual explicit consensual image that two people thought they were sending to each other. The fact that a committee of people at the service provider inspects it before they hand it on to police is not comforting. If if the Australian"

    "text": "Law enforcement authorities deliberately added it to the list because it is illegal in Australia. Then the committee may be obliged to report it, even if it wasn't one of the categories that they thought this was going to be useful. And if a genuinely malevolent external party has attacked it in the way I described in the 3rd slide, then there's a risk that they've infiltrated that secondary process. And they're they're already documented cases, for example, of agent the Saudi government infiltrating Twitter in order to expose information about Saudi dissidents who were anonymously posting on Twitter. So I don't really see a good solution, a good procedural solution, address any of these concerns. There are some transparency efforts by from the, like, research literature that derive from the sort of cryptographic transit traditions of transparent and verifiable kind of computation to give for example, to prove that everybody is being compared against the same list of to give people the opportunity to verify that certain things are not in the log. And various other clever encryptite things, There's a couple of good examples here, but both of these works despite being interesting and clever make it very clear that they're not a complete solution to any of these problems and that, for example, that don't really solve the whistleblower detection problem because you kinda have to know what you're looking for. It's very hard to prove the absence of anything within a certain hamming distance of a given hash, And all in all, although they're interesting, really don't solve the problem. So That's mild. 2nd plus side. So in summary, if you happen to be living in a country where ubiquitous, warrantless scanning of everybody's devices, just in case they turn out to be a terrorist or a pedophile is accepted. Which apparently I do. There remain"

We have a queue starting. So Wes kick us off. Thanks very much, West Hardaker, I say. Fascinating, you know, problem and and certainly one that is being well thought about in many venues right now and and with many concerns. A couple of thoughts occurred to me I guess I'll stick with one Images are great. You know, with the advent of video and 3 d worlds and everything else, you know, it seems like they're obsolete at this point, practically, let alone frames within a video, let alone, you know, pictures pixelated onto the side of a 3 d triangular set of objects and things like that. I assume that the, lawmakers and the technologists have not even come close to being able to catch up to that type of of of you know, hashing order, you know, whatever terminology you wanna use. Is there been, do you have any thoughts or have you seen much in that regard? So there are there are actual hash functions on videos. I've never looked at them carefully, and I've I I don't know whether there are Research papers on the same kinds of attacks, but I assume there would I assume it wouldn't be any harder than that would be for images. Well, I guess I would bring it to the next question. The computational feasibility of of doing, you know, movies or, larger data objects. I mean, the the problem is is that there's a there's a difference between recorded videos of a particular length where you can analyze the entire content the file in an entire past versus"

As we don't have anybody in the queue, but we had a lot discussion in the chat, I would actually like to call. Ori because and he's not listening. He is because he, like, moved your attack and to the to another level with AI. So you wanna maybe explain that and start the discussion here. Yeah. Hello. Ori Steele. So I work on, supply chain security and transparency here at the IATF and Our our focus in the Skit Working Group is on software supply chain transparency, but we interact with, All aspects of the software ecosystem, including you know, provenance for artificial intelligence models and content derived from artificial intelligence models. So I left a comment in the chat sort of basically saying, you know, these days, you can ask an AI to generate you interesting content, that's very finely tuned both with text or with know, control net and other techniques. And if you've got, you know, an implementation of 1 of these perceptual hash function sitting around, and you can kind of sit those 2 things next to each other and just ask an image that hits the hash over and over again until you get one. Probably take Do you like very short period of time to set that up? If you wanted to. So it doesn't seem like a particularly good system. Yeah. agree. I Alright. Brian, Yep. So, yeah, I'll actually Hello. Thank you for the talk. That was awesome. Standing Ovation in my room at 5 in the morning.

Would you think are evidence that there are already pre image attacks occurring these databases. none, As far as I know, which doesn't mean they're not occurring, So the specific example that I mentioned the Irish example, the police will quant Khoi about exactly what it was, but the those two examples that I mentioned were the 2 examples I said that I said, adult adult content and kids playing at the beach. They didn't say that that was comprehensive, so good. The assumption is that there's no indication that any of the stuff that was wrongly categorized was deliberately. So there is quite a lot of work about It's quite a few papers that look at accidental collisions of the sexual hash functions in very large databases. And Again, all of the examples that I know of, things that are kind of plausible and accidental, for example, things that really look the same, like a big photo, a a big photo of one kind of big, long black stick on a white background and some different person who took another have a different big black stick on a white background kind of thing. So I don't know of any evidence by anybody that any of these attacks are being deliberately performed other than researchers raising awareness, doesn't mean they're not being performed. Would would there be any way to easily detect that? No. I need obvious ways, but the yeah, I I mean, if you somehow came across both images, right, Right. So unless the people performing the attacks were making their cautious evident, which the researchers are, how would you even know that they were doing it Cool."

    "text": "Thank you very much. Good question, though. But Yep. Martin Thompson. I just wanna draw people's attention to analogs with what Vanessa's talking about. Here and some of the things that are going on in in adjacent areas. So a lot of focus right now on provenance for AI generated content, And one of the one of the methods that's often touted as being Excellent. Is is kind of a reverse perceptual hash in a way whereby you have an image and you apply tweaks to that image such that it produces a watermark. And you have another system, that detects the presence of that watermark and through Any any types of manipulations the watermark is supposedly preserved. And, again, there was a long list of of material that basically describes, well, if you've got a model that applies to the watermark, and a model that detects it. You can put a model in in between that removes it and another one that a different one in Yeah. End, it turns out these are really very difficult problems and, it's quite possible that there are no good solutions. And in fact, I think I've seen people claim that in some of these pay Yep. Yeah. But and so at this point, I I would like to, like, just rephrase your point, which is, like, we talk so much about the cryptography, but the problem is also the transparency and, like, how this data is sourced. Right? And that's something that is even harder, and we don't talk much too much about it or not enough about it. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that very much, actually. But it's, in some ways, it's more the transparency that's actually. And in the context of law enforcement, my transparency is a huge deal. Transparency is the thing that stops law enforcement being abused for kinds of reasons. And so the, the fact that it's actually the transparency aspect here that is broken is actually a huge deal."

What I've kind of where should I go to look for some details about these perpetual hash functions? Typically, people talk about them, but they say some are secrets, some are just code, Is there a good kind of reference to discussing their properties and how they work? So it's quite a frustrating sort of corner because it it really came out of mostly out of behind the scenes kind of industry. It it didn't come At least I certainly haven't seen a lot of scientific literature about it, which is why that weird definition was the best that I could do.
