Brian loans from kinetic quantum cryptography offers the only protection against quantum computing and all future networks will undoubtedly combine both through the air and fiber optic technologies okay here\u0027s another example all cryptographic schemes used currently on the internet would be broken that\u0027s not actually true this was said by you bizarre who is an IEC our fellow and ex editor-in-chief of the Journal of cryptology so he\u0027s a pretty solid cryptographer and he said that too at a lunch meeting of some Institute this is an early example of alternative facts here\u0027s MIT technology review as early as 2003 this is 2td is one of 10 emerging technologies that will change the world even Burt cholesky who many of us know and highly respect said back at this time if there are things that you want to keep protected for another 10 to 30 years you need quantum cryptography these are examples that I gave at a talk 10 years ago this year at the fuse Institute at the University of Toronto so these are all 10 years old so what\u0027s the big holdup why we\u0027re not already using quantum key distribution but I\u0027ll give you four reasons and I have backup slides so if anybody wants to debate this with me let\u0027s list it in the coffee break after and qkd doesn\u0027t actually do what it says on the tin it doesn\u0027t distribute keys it expands existing keys and if you already have a key in place you can expand it in all kinds of ways and build as many keys as you need to using things like key derivation functions ok qkd has significant limits on both range and rate range is the most fundamental one you may have heard about the Chinese quantum key distribution network running from Beijing to Shanghai it sounds very very impressive but it does not provide end-to-end security it\u0027s a sequence of links join together and each intermediate point you can read the traffic in the clear ok if you want "
