    "text": "artificial intelligence instead of artificial intelligence for network you know and um well I think it\u0027s more important for example as an operator actually in the current network we have a lot of data from the network no not talking about using new technologies for example a mentor seems losing the existing technology we have a lot of data but we don\u0027t know how to use it so it and those data are not collected in a very efficient way um you know it\u0027s it\u0027s it\u0027s just useless it\u0027s there so it\u0027s very important to tackle the problem how we can collect the data from from the network more efficiently and to filter out the data to be the input of your AI algorithm and to get the output you want for example if we have a long massive collection of bandwidth I mean live bandwidth data from the real network would that give you a prediction of how you configure different domain of network to to have to give you a out spirit of for example for low latency network I mean we have some research project with vendors to tackle this like like converting the dimension of how you using some type of algorithm to converting the dimension of from bandwidth to latency using some existing data yeah so that\u0027s what I mean it\u0027s I think it\u0027s more interesting to to to tackle the problem how the data can be collected how the network technology to support an AI algorithm instead of investigating a algorithm for networking thank you Alex we\u0027re out of time okay so I don\u0027t I think just one an hour one hour for this was obviously not enough and I don\u0027t think we came up with a I think we still have these two things AI for network and network for AI and I think it follows pretty well with the hi and I had discuss that maybe there could be two different types of approaches to this so AI as an application in the network and the network being a feeder for the AI and we can continue the discussion I don\u0027t know there\u0027s a number of mailing lists I\u0027ve been involved and I don\u0027t know exactly how we\u0027re going to do that but we\u0027ll find a way yeah and to build on that I would say if if you\u0027re interested if you think we need to keep having meetings discussion or try to organize and structure this those questions I don\u0027t I ate here for IOT F scopes okay we are still here I\u0027m here also tomorrow so come to us I mean if not only to us I mean anybody can discuss but we have to understand you can use the meaning list or if we need to prepare something for the next meeting in between the meeting but if if "
