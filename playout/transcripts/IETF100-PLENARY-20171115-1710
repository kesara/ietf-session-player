John\u0027s another person told me that some of his best friends are people that he has met in the ITF so I want people to really think about that for a second if this is your first IETF meeting anyway this is their first IETF meeting oh yeah bunch of people so you can look to your left and look to your right and think these are gonna be my best friends in 35 years and if you\u0027ve been participating since the 80s and you already have those 35 year friends you can think to yourself those friendships have lasted twice as long as the average marriage already this is this is what the IETF inspires some people right it\u0027s amazing but we must be doing something right if we\u0027re bringing people together who you know remain friends for that long we use this term community a lot in our in our daily life probably you probably heard it you know a couple dozen times today while you were sitting in working group meetings talking about consensus decisions and so forth but we rarely actually stop to consider the sort of fellowship that it that it implies and that really came through in in the chats that I had with with folks "

    "text": "who have been participating a long time the last thing that I learned was about the sort of spirit that permeates the halls of these meetings I asked people what was the best thing that hasn\u0027t changed and there was a just remarkable consistency to the answers here so one person told me that talked about people working together towards a common goal another person said there\u0027s a general feeling of collaboration for the greater good essential people doing the right thing I mean listen to this stuff right like think about which other sdo do you go to and this is what they they tell you it\u0027s about the commitment of its people to help the Internet grow there\u0027s really a sense here that people come together not necessarily because they are you know motivated by their employer or even personally motivated but motivated to give something back to contribute to something larger than just their own project but to but to come and collaborate to create something larger than themselves and I think that\u0027s as true today as a problem that as it seems that it was at IETF one so I would invite people to raise that glass that you have in your hand and toast to 100 or maybe 99 meetings worth of friendship and collaboration and service of the greater good Cheers so now we get to go to the boring part here\u0027s our agenda for today we\u0027re going to hear a few words from the host of this meeting then we\u0027ll do brief updates on hot topics from me from the administrative side Leslie and Portia and from the NomCom Peter ghee a quick preview of ITF 101 then we\u0027ll have a recognition of some individuals who are stepping away from the ITF we\u0027ll have the presentation of the Postell award from my sock and then we\u0027ll have the technical plenary portion which is doing a forward look at social political and technical perspectives of what the internet is going to look like in the future and then we\u0027ll end with open mics as usual so first big thanks to our hosts for this meeting Cisco the meetings really wouldn\u0027t be the same if we didn\u0027t have the support of our sponsors so we\u0027re really thankful for that and I will invite Dave Ward to come on up and give us a few words "
