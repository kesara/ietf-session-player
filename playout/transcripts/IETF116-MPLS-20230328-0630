So basically, it this is the purpose of Ip Udp encapsulation to prevent leaking b or any messages out of box. Because it... It's not really a loop back. For Ip six, there is only single back interface defined. So more proposing to say that for Ip six. Type of Ip udp encapsulation of over. Lsd that address once slash one twenty eight should be used. But send might use they're Ip address from My six range that is Ip mapped loop back interfaces.

Stamp or simple to wait active measurement protocol users the echo request reply mechanism and involves two actors session sender and such reflect. So by name the sender generates stem test packet. What's the timestamp sequence number, somehow additional information on this packet received by the reflect, reflect ads time stamp of the receiving of the test packet. Copy some information from the receipt packet in the reflected packet adds its own sequence number so that there packet loss one way can be calculated or if it doesn't support then, packet loss can be only calculated on a round trip and then starts puts the timestamp on while transmitting the packet.

So This proposes encapsulation Ip udp encapsulation of stamp test packet and reflected packet over and bill. So for Ip before encapsulation, it's to use any address from one twenty seven slash eight or loop back range And for Ip six, it's single one slash one twenty eight. Back address. To bootstrap this session, it can be stem session id to simplifying the demo multiplex in those sessions. And that to be included in.

Welcome comments questions cooperation and do draft this pretty simple straightforward So would like we appreciate the working group consideration of adopting this work. Jared March, Aka. I'm curious the response you know, from the Udp port, is that gonna be coming out of a hardware path or is that gonna get punched up to the control plane path? I think that is implementation specific So Okay. I I'm familiar with the limitations that do a lot of hardware assist. Definitely... And actually, if we go more into details of stem protocol. We have an extension defined that is that already published R that allows you to specify the way because what's important here is how you obtain the world value. Okay. And how you do the time thing? Because basically, since the reflect and and actually, it's equally applicable to sender and reflect. How you obtain whether you obtain this in a software or you have a hardware assist So because if you can do time consistently before you parents queuing delays, so that increases your accuracy of the time stamp. So then how you process the packet is not that critical because you can measure really time delay of the propagation and processing on transit nodes So that excludes your host delay. Yeah. The reason why I ask is we've seen"

That we're in upper in our our normal operational environment, we're actually running out of the filter space and a lot of the hardware platforms. And so whenever we're talking about adding additional port that needs to be permitted. That could potentially end up on the, you know, the pump path or the slow path as as well. That gives me an an area of concern. And so I'm wondering if there's an is a place where we could, you know, either share within some existing, you know, you know, Ls ping or other port range mechanism to go and prevent allocating a port in the very limited firewall scale that many of the hardware platforms have. Mh. I see. Again, so udp port eight sixty two has been assign as test port for T rom protocol T test protocol, and it can be inherited by Stem because one of the objective of stamp was that to allow its deployment in a T right environment. Of authenticated mode. So here, we just take advantage of this eight sixty port. But as I mentioned, I don't know if it helps. See purpose of using Udp ports from dynamic range was that to make it less detectable. But at the same time, we in I working group we realized there is a benefit of simplifying provisioning and using well known ports. So basically, two options exist. I don't think it really answers your question."

It's something that We shouldn't factor in all of the current hardware limit stations that we have today into future protocol design, but I think it's something to be that we need to think about as her standardized standardizing in a new protocol. Mh. And proposing using new port numbers because there are bounds at least on the equipment today and if we continue to scale them up, some of the vendors automatically do the right thing and other ones we have to spend when you actually go to implement the operations of the protocol. You require a lot of additional complex work in order to configure the device correctly. Correctly and be securely. And so I think it's something we need to. It's think about as we define it important numbers. It is very good input because again, what we have in we have different protocols and product protocols means by I identified by the Udp unique Udp ports. For our fault management and performance monitoring. As an in comparison to that for internet Oem, they are on the same ethernet type. So then they op differentiate Ccm from Dm and for example, or synthetic loss measurements. So Yes. That's more conservative there. But here we have what we have. We had some ideas of floating of having integrated Oem which will be unifying for fault management and performance monitoring so we can have this discussion I'm very much interested if you reach out and we can talk about it."

In the data plane with Mp data plan, the forty states for a replication set is actually identical to the forwarding states that we use for O q or r, p G three notes.

You either using Bg or Psa or even other approaches like neck example whatever. In this case, again, the each replication segment is identified by the tu of our replication Id know Id.

That indication ping can be carried in the signal itself. Or it could be by provisioning for example, ish notes It's all the notes in the in the Sr six network.

Similarly, for rc, we will have the capability signaling in the hollow message in the and then we're we normally would have the it had one label objects, now we were using new type of the labor objects to yeah signal S sr six eight.
