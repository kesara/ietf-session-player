So call for contribution to what we consider to be in important works. If you're in the group and you're participating, we encourage and hereby solicit you know, contributions to the milestones. It helps us track our progress and it helps us understand like where we think the industry is going and where folks want to, you know want to get what they want to get to There's the free IPV6 textbook that now has an is bn number so it's you know it's a real book now. It's open source. That's the GitHub repo and I would also encourage folks to read that in contribute to it if they see that there are things that need to be added or adjusted. It's even been copy edited at this point So if you find anything else in there, it would be really good to know. We can make those adjustments Other tasks that we have, then we'd like to work on.

However, please keep in mind that this draft is not strictly speaking about option 108. It's about when or disable or enable CILAT This draft would be applicable even if the client does not support Option 108 and just sits on V6 V6-only network, for example, network which does not provide any IPE before at all, right? We adding option 108 to the picture because it's most common deployment scenario and I will be presented another draft about that, right? And we just want to make sure that if network actually has before and client is going to use before, Silat is getting disabled I'm not sure if I managed to unconfuse you, but we can continue the discussion anyway or on the list, please Okay.

Go ahead for the next slide slide um a couple things so the third version of the draft, we updated it to a BCP. It was informational. We talked about this last time everyone seemed to be on board. So we changed that to a BCP We added text. We had a nice conversation, the last ITI about NTP, and just clarifying that in this case, it's really just relaying the NTP information to the land. We do not want an NTP server in the box, but we do want to tell people, hey you should just take the info you learn on the WAN and pass it along, basically. So we added that text on the box, but we do want to tell people, hey, you should just take the info you learn on the WAN and pass it along, basically. So we added that text. We added some texts for, you know, should support 91.31, which is first hopper getting them in the neighbor cache. We think that's probably a good idea And then the last thing originally we up level S2, which is ingress filtering. This is to stop spoof attacks.

Feel free, guys, Ben and Jordi, to get up and yell things at me. These are the drafts we're kind of looking at right now for potentially evaluating. Jen got some thoughts for me. No I'm just, yes, so we took it evaluating. Jen, got some thoughts for me. No, I'm just, yes, so we're talking about what to do in terms of Slack Renam Truth, and Uniquing Locals So stay tuned, like in the next few weeks, I will be updates.

So I obviously very, very happy to see that you considering it. I'm just saying that drafts might change. But I just while i'm here i really love this work thank you I'm surprised it's not adopted yet. Yeah, I mean, we're going to ask for that at the end of this. But yeah, I mean, it's obviously it's a working group milestone too so I'm feeling pretty good about getting adopted. So yeah we'll ask for that too. The other one on here is obviously the draft that is a working group document is the CPE land PD I think you've seen some text about that or some emails about that this week that's another one we're gonna hope hopefully get to working group last call and then we can wrap that up. I don't think we're going to want to include that in 7084 right off the bat because it's too new but i think we could talk about that it might maybe it'll be depend on how long it takes us to get this wrapped up So those are the draft candidates and then go to the last slide"

I was thinking about the sort of should be able to disable the firewall Sort of uh i'm not a fan of like ingress filtering enabled by default Can we have like must allow user to enable? if device has UI or something? Because I mean, otherwise you've got these CPs where you know, like I have a CP that's under that provided by the ISP, and it has a fiber port and it's got a, it's got an O&U key that I can't get at. And if that has a firewall I just would not be able to do incoming connecting at all. Fortunately, it does have a way for me to enable the firewall. But I think I can get like, you know, you have these CPU root as user can't control and then yeah, maybe that's fine Yeah. All right, I'll, I'll take that. Maybe I can come over with some texts that will get us out of that. I understand the general feeling. Yeah, I mean, we want, by default, we want to stop spook but I get the, there are use cases where people know what they're doing Hi, I'm Masanobu from Enishipratons. Could you consider to add a IPv6 UPNP? Because in Japan, because in Japan, know what they're doing. Hi, I'm Masanob from Enishipratoms. Could you consider to add IPV6 UPNP? Because in Japan, the IPV6 UPNP is increasing now for the gaming and we also observed the IPV6 UPNAP implementation Germany, French, France, etc that's why we should discuss about us.

Just going back to Lorenzo's point, right? Like I think the ingress filtering the text is very clear on what ingress filtering it is it's pretty much BCP 38 right like so it's just Ingress, like a source that is spoofing filtering So it's not a default closed firewall, Lorenzo, just to make sure that that's clear, right? Right, I should have said that, yes It's not the regular firewall like a 1692 simple security one. Good ted lemon. So just on the topic of I guess, ingress filtering and PCP and UPNP, whatever that is because there isn't a spec that meaningfully there isn't a spec, as to what requiring UNP would, UPNP would mean We should not mention UPNP that is not an IETF spec and in order to mention UPNP, we would have to specify precisely what we mean by UPNP because it's actually a giant attack surface with only one thing that we care about in it Yeah.

And it also addresses the problem of the Lorenzo's talking about with opening up ports on the outside in a programmatic way so that we don't have the situation where end users are in a default open situation and have no way to control it so I just think that that you know we should require PCP, not make it optional Oh, boy. Yeah, no, seriously. We should require PCP And that's solves this problem. So a couple of things I'm going to say about that I have, I don't know, somewhere hundreds of CPEs sitting in my lab. I don't have one of them that does PCP. Right, and the reason we don't is because R.C.7084 doesn't require it. I mean, okay we can... Seriously, like, that's why I mean, yeah, okay. Like, you, it is not hard to implement. It's way easier than UPNP, but nobody implemented it because nobody ever, nobody ever, like, got dinged for not having it in their implementation all right let me i'll take that feedback and consider it uh i having it in their implementation. All right, let me, I'll take that feedback and consider it. You know, my instinct here is definitely to start with the should here. I think going straight to must is wild and crazy but maybe we should be a little bit, I don't even think we say should right now, so we clearly should up level this. So speaking as some who's like constantly being burned by routers that don't support this, as a vendor who doesn't unfortunately sell routers anymore Yeah. It's really a problem that UPN is, or sorry, the PCP The PCP. Do we support? What do you mean? support, what do you mean? Your vendor, you said, do you support? Would, if, that UPNP is, or sorry, the PCP. Do we support it? Do we support, what do you mean? Would, if PCP is present. Is that a no? If PCP is present in the router, then yeah, it'll work Yeah, no, we support it. I mean, it works. If it's in the router, though right? I mean, we need a router to implement it in order to use it, right? It doesn't work without the router, so, yeah, so um so no i mean we i think that that the only way this is ever going to proceed is if it's required, and I don't see any reason not"

All right, all right you, Ted. I'll, I'll, well, we'll think about that. I think Tim is saying that it will be our problem once it, once bad implementations arrive if that might happen. Yes, that is my primary concern So a couple of points I would like to note that unfortunately, if hosts implement PCP, they must support they must prefer PCP net 64 detection over Pref64 note that, unfortunately, if hosts implement PCP, they must prefer PCP net 64 64 detection over Pref 64, unfortunately. Okay. So yeah we might have to update a six-man document if we don't like that That was a compromise that was made when Pref 64 option was defined Okay. Another thing, I wanted to respond to Suresh about when you say the text is very clear, I'm going to read the text The CE Ritter is expected to offer mechanisms to filter traffic entering the custom network. However, the message by which vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope of this document. Security requirements one, two, and the third one is, if the IPBC router firewall is configured to filter incoming tunnel data, the firewall should provide the capability to filter decapsilate the final So, yeah it's a I mean this document takes new position with the sucks functionality is enabled by default to mechanisms by which users would configure it I mean, yeah, I don't think it's right.

I don't know how much of you were in the room last time So I spent most of my time recently deploying V6 most and dealing with all those interesting details and I was advised that it might be a good idea to document how to do this because I assumed everyone knows how to do that but apparently not so this document basically talking about how you deploy V6 mostly what's the benefit of it what you should consider when you deploy it, and what kind of systematic issues"

Obviously the draft is not talking about like that kind of vendor bugs you go into encounter because it's a number limited field It was a presentation last time with many details about the draft but now I'm just presenting an update. Next slide, please Yes, next slide. So what changed since we met last time? Yeah, so security consideration sections were added So the key points are that when you do not have a safety net of IPV4, all IPV6 issues or attacks will be definitely much more visible, right? In dual stack network, all non- cares if UV6 doesn't work But if you do not have V4, it's obviously a problem The main new attack vector, in V6 mostly would be if an attacker managed to spoof NAD6 for presence, right? So as a result, it could either cause denial of service if that spoof not six for prefix is not routed anywhere and that six four is not on the network or in the worst case scenario if attacker managed somehow to redirect the traffic to themselves it could be a man in the middle. Well, mitigation is used make sure your array guard is in place. And again, very recommend using Prev6 option in array to detect, not 64 presence not DNS RFC 74 method because obviously it's much more secure And also, as Tomi already presented, the recommendation is that Celad shall be disabled must be disabled, sorry, as soon as APV4 is detected. And obviously the main motivation is that if the network is not actually V6 mostly but dual stack, it's likely that your V6"

It's not like it's something you should test before you enable this, right? Let me put it that way, right? It's not a fundamental unsolvable issue, but it's something you might encounter So yeah, Tommy already mentioned that operations team and users might be confused when they do not see any hope and trace route. They would users would come be confused when they do not see any hops and trace route. Users would complain that you have a packet loss when you actually do not I mean I mean data packet loss because trace route packets are definitely lost. So yes, again, slides are slightly outdated about any way there is a work going on to fix this. Actually, it's problem in their draft about ICMP translation is not limited to trace route It would also affect PASM2 discovery Because if you receive an ICMP error, like, a packet too big from intermediate V6-only hope you could not translate it you could not send it to silat discovery, because if you receive an ICMP error, like a packet too big from intermediate V6 only hope, you could not translate it, you could not send it to CILAT, which means pass them to discover gets even more broken I had some discussion about, oh, you probably should not have any MTA issue in V6 only part of your network and if you do, it's your fault should not have any MTO issue in V6 only part of your network, and if you do it's your, it's your fault. Well, I can imagine some cases when, for example, I don't know, your backup connectivity to your not six, four the edge of your network might go through some tunnels and you don't use most of the time, but for 1% of it when, for example, I don't know, your backup connectivity to your not 6-4 at the edge of your network might go through some tunnels, and you do not use most of the time, but for 1% of the time it's happening.

Next slide, please Yeah, a few open issues which have not been resolved in the draft yet. Next slide Yes, so currently the document is like mostly operational. I am I simple network operator. I do not deal with applications too much, so the draft is mostly talking what the network engineer should configure We basically do not talk much about what applications should do right? However, I don't know, maybe it makes sense to add some recommendations which might help network operators operators to create a list of requirements when they talk to software vendors Next slide, please Yeah, again, favorite topic, DNS versus DNS 64 So DNS 64 currently when you deploy with mostly would do two things. First of all, it would allow your application like CLAT and API which does local synthesis to discover which prefix to use for local synthesis. Again, currently there is no reason to use DNS64 except historical because you're not network shall be able to provide you that prefix in array. As far as I know, the vast majority of the widely deployed routing platforms are capable of sending Pref64 for a router advertisement and also if you do in RFC 7 70-50, you also need to do RFC 88080 which tells you that if your application is using third party resolve, we're not one provided by the network, please"

Obviously and everything is broken So basically, yeah, RFC 7050 is much hard than people might think, and it's not secure. So probably we shouldn't be using DNS-6-7 for detecting pre-6-4. Well, if you have a proper application which only using names, now never does before literals and so on those applications might just use DNS64 to get a synthesized records and so on. So it's a second function of DNS 64 Next slide, please So the draft current recommends that It actually goes back to that discussion, shall we provide any recommendations to applications So local synthesis and CELA should be performed using pref64 from array and which means we only currently need DNS 64 for two cases, right? You have a whole like I don't know Linux laptop which does not have CLAT so it would rely on the DNS 64. However, again, only some applications would use it. So a lot of things will be still broke for example stun if you don't use relays for your VABRTC because STAN fundamentally uses IPV for literals and nothing can be done about that, right? Or if you host a does not support RFC 8781 for detected pref6 for an array. So to sum it up practically, I think in some cases it should be possible right now to have V6 mostly network without DNS 64 if you only use it"

So I arrive and 64 if you're only using operating systems which have CILAT and sent option 108 so in the last ripe meeting it was an experiment for disabling DNS64 on the V6 Mosley Network for like one day I think So as far as I know, if you speak about modern operating systems, the only few cases discovered were like some Linux laptop which had IP optional 108 enabled and it's not the default configuration right so if you rely on default configuration on endpoints most likely you wouldn't even need DNS6 for currently, but if you expect your users to be like geeks who might actually, for example, go to configuration on Linux or enable option or one way, you might still need it. But yeah, it would it would be great to get rid of DNS requirements for DNS 6-4 because it's a hacky way, right? It doesn't solve all your problems. It creates issues with DNS second, so on. So it used to be useful, but I would really like to see it slowly dying Next slide, please Yeah, so I think last time I presented this idea of using globally unique link locals when your link local address of default gateway actually specific to a well, you can say it, Villano mobility domain so basically subset of network segments between we which your host might roll. Like, for example, if you have dot 1X with dynamic VLAN assignment, and your host might move between those villan and wire network, it would be nice if each router has its own globally unique alien-clocal address so it's I'd like to hear the opinion we can still have those operational recommendations in the separate draft or those recommendations could be merged into VC a mostly document"

Right, anyone can do that if you configure your own router manually however the draft has second part about some CPU routers, for example not even cp any router can do something like that automatic and this is kind of goes to six men. And we just discussing about merging it into Slackenum because it's about how the router generates its local address So it's a kind of gray between six men and V6 Ops. So I would like to hear opinions. Would you like to see? very extended section in this draft or we can keep it as V6 Ops separate one. Next slide please. Oh, yeah, that's so all. I would really like to hear comments feedback, especially if you have deployed something like that, and I would love to consider adoption if chairs and the group could consider adopting this Run, Warren, run. warren kumari The Gula stuff is cool, but I think it should be in a separate document Like we should get this one done and shipped, and the other we can get done in ship two two Every thing, I would be basically repeating, echoing what Warren said but the two documents specifically if this one is called uh pv6 mostly and some people will not read an APV6 mostly document to fix the gula okay very fair point yeah thank you also yeah it would be another draft again in V6 Ops.

I think one thing that one thing that we were talking about with David david is about how david was about how to how to implement rule 5.5 and then linux kernel and it was like really complicated if we and he came up with this scenario where a router basically sends you like alternate data you know in some arrays it just sends you the PIO and some in some arrays it sends you the RIO and it's like change its mind every five minutes and that was really hard to implement. So one though, the same router you mean yes well let's assume we talk talking about the same router and router is identified by the given link local address as long as you're as you're saying everything together yes as long as you're clear that it's per link local address like perceived router from the host side as opposed to actual hardware box, I think that's fine. Well, like two virtual routers, you can tell, right? If it's the same router or not as long as link local addresses are different you should treat it as a different router so any other questions no good thank you very much All right Again. Hello.

Next slide So this is a this discussion is kind of, has been a topic that has come up, you know, that I've discussed with other other folks, you know working on deploying IPv6 and kind of the question mark that always comes up is this last, does the inter know, that I've discussed with other folks, you know, you know, working on deploying IPv6 and kind of the question mark that always comes up is the interphase ID and just a massive 64-bit sign of the interface ID and why does it need to be and then explaining that, you know, does it need to be in the reason behind that but um you know, I'm sure anybody in this, anybody, you know, here to today, you know, on this, in this meeting today, I mean, has gotten this question asked many, many, many times over the years and so you here, you know, in a discussion, I think was at the end of last year, this topic came up again. And I think brian carpenter as well, and some other, and a whole bunch of folks on the ops were on the discussion and Brian had mentioned a possible solution. So in this in this slide deck we're going to be talking about the problem statement and at the very end, the solution that I discussed on six men will discuss that briefly at the very end. But in that discussion that was November of last year, it was basically a really about this topic about having that large interface ID And understandably, you need that for privacy when you're connected to the internet, but do you really need that for private or private uses or enterprise? use cases where it's in a control code control the environment? So that's kind of a big thing here And why and it and maybe"

Next slide So, so the problem statement, so really the big one is like the inflexible you know, standard with having that's a corporate boundary like it's a one-size-fits-all we've had the 60 class 64 bed boundary for three years. It's been like that for a prolonged time of course changing it if you do we do change it we have to be you know careful that we don't break anything. So having a really robust and solid solution that allows for a backward compatibility that we don't break anything so that's that's of like the double-ed sword. We do want it to happen. We would like it to change we'd like to change it but we do not want to break anything The big problem, I mean, the issue is that exist today with not having that change up so happen. We would like it to change, we'd like to change it, but we do not want to break anything. The big problem, I mean, the issues that exist today with not having that change, and this is something that's existed for many years as well So VLSM, even though, you know, there's just discussions about, you know, different types of implementation, some use cases, some use cases where people decide to do SOS 64 everywhere, and there's issues with doing so, but I would say a lot of enterprise and service providers do VLS and go crazy with VLSM I have implementations where I've I've deployed quite a bit of V6, you know, many, many, ums solutions where I've deployed V6 and I've done VLSM, but it's not, I haven't gone crazy with VLSM, but it's been in a control fashion with a very with a limited number of masks that I've used. But when you doing BLSM, especially when you have both sitting on that subnet, it's really impossible to have GATpb zips only devices on a subnet or static only or slack. You're always going to have a mix of all three but what ends up happening is if you have a Slack device and that Slack device has that 64-bit fixed boundary, now those DHSAP"

So that's really a difficult situation, and we've lived with that for a long time This next bullet is, is interesting one, and this is really a reality and there are a lot of operators that have the situation where they have their provisioning systems are fixed and they're fixed that's last 64 and they cannot change them it's very very difficult and it's been set like that for decades and it cannot be changed and that's been fixed broadband and for for mobile broadband quite a lot and in some cases both fixed broadband and mobile broadband, both are fixed at the time last 64 so if you want to sub 10 there's no way to do it because you're stuck stuck and you can't subdivide that class 64 so that that is a serious problem and then these other topics, we've discussed this quite a bit on mailing list but home home and so off food trying to be able to sub tend as well you got a slash 64 you need to break it down And then 3GPP with UTI V2B, V2X networking, 6 low iot devices and then and the last one is i ISP backbone pops where the NCE attacks you know, having that exhaustion and distributed denial service attacked against the neighbor discovery cache next slide.

We have another presentation update. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So I'm going to try to speed through this. So there's a bunch of others some possible solutions that have come up. You know, to extend this last 64 bit down here and other possibility, but the big problem is kind of really that lowest common denominator issue.

Next slide. So as well, 3GPP and Ripe standard for IPV6, you know, allow for, you know, longer prefix, I mean, shorter prefix However, because of provisioning systems being stuck at that slash 64, you really can't take advantage of you can't actually shorten that prefix and that's that that's just an issue that's kind of, um, issue that exists and the only way to get around that is actually a very variable length IAD. Next slide this case as well, so DATPB6 Prefect Delegation with the mode of management this issue has existed as well that they get their firewall on the on the motor devices, they're not able to allow the dh2pd package it's blocked within their firewall. So you can, you're not able to use it, you're not able to get a shorter prefix from using DATPB v6pd however that issue cannot be really even if you went shorter that doesn't resolve the issue because now you're still stuck with this lowest common denominator that issue would be mbb and fb provisioning systems that cannot be changed. Next slide So this is Decide just talks about that you cases, being able to subten and tethering for v2i v2x use cases kind of some details about that, but that's something that you know requirement to be able to sub ten having a short, a longer issue of some details about that, but that's something that, you know, a requirement to be able to subten having a shorter IID, but being able to subdivide that's us 644.

Next slide So this is the 64 share and then I think a future version of 64-Cair V2 had been talked about in the past, but that is well, you know that's still going shorter and we can't really go shorter because we got these fixed provision systems. Next slide So this next few slides just talked about BLSM so the LSM is a reality and I just talked about everyone familiar with this slash 127 You know, I think before it was something to be harmful of not to use but slash 16 slash 127 are proliferated, you know every service provider does that on point to point links is pretty widely widely used next slide and not and using a slastic 64, of course, you end up with an NC exhaustion issue and possible denial service attacks. Next slide And this is just kind of going into still more detail about the NC exhaustion So this is just how about the reality of just with this draft of RFC 7381 just talk about the reality of the LSM.

You may have an I-speed map just a typical provider network so like you have service provider network we have point to point links 127 you may have an ixb nap nap and you and you may have shorter you know, you may want you would like to have a short prefix less than a size 64 in you know, you may want, you would like to have a shorter prefix less than a 564, and then there may be cases where, let's say, in a data set center, you have data center, and data center submits and server cluster and you may want to do a slash 1212 it's kind of that discussion that really being able to have very variable length masking capability with BLSM. Next slide And then this is the last last one in the main part of the slide deck is really that the problem would be having slack, you know, shackling dhcpb6 and static, you know, now you're stuck. You're going to have, no matter what you're always going to have a mix of these three types. You have DHPBBC you're going to have static and you're going to have slack. But with Slack being stuck, you're going to have static, and you're going to have Slack DATBB6 pools, you're stuck at 64 as well as, as well as any anything, static. So it really kind of hairpins any other addressing scheme, you know, do to Slack So, and that's something that we've lived with. Operators have lived with you know since the inception of IPv6 and it's really something that really needs to change. Next slide So this is going to going, so I finished the discussion over the problems statement, and I'll see whatever I can kind of go through. I talked about this on the 6th BN, but what I'll do is I'm going to try to get to the meat of it. So in this in this solution, the variable I need really the crux is that we want to ensure backwards compatibility. We don't want to break anything so what we're doing is we're using the PIO field, so it's a reserve to field 32 bit field, and just six bits of that reserve two where only the goal is that we would we would just do a slight tweet"

And so with that reserve two field, we adding 16 bits to the prefix and reducing the variable ID down from 64 to 48. And so with that reserve two field, we're using that to signal the length. Next slide So how we do that is, so on any link where the variable ID exists, what we would do, what we want variable ID the network side, it would actually signal that by sending in that reserve two field that six bits it would reserve it would send that in the RAPIO to be a bit set, and then this way it would override the value defined in rFC 2464 and 4291 for prefixes concerned that are being advertised So any prefix that you want to advertise at that very good length, it would be signaled with the length field and encoded into the reserve two field six bits so so when that variable ID specified in that six bids is sent the signal to modified host that support variable ID, and so those are the only ones only devices that would act on those 64 that six-bit field, and now would actually see a long prefix and now it would be able to adjust its interface ID to that shorter length and so the recommendation here is to basically to put that six bits into the reserve two field of the PIO. Next slide So here, wen lin the in the reserve Q field, so what would happen if you have all zeros, that would mean 64 bit length. So no change, fully backward compatible. And now if you have, if you have anything that's less so what we would do is any values less than 48 bits would not be allowed, so we'd have 0-0-110 so that's encoded as a slash 48, so then that would prevent the rate to go to the bottom So we would not allow anything. So the prefix would be 64 to 8 and the iad would be a maximum of uh"

We're encoding that in here. So this allows that we're going to signal for the network and we're eliminating any possibility of any any any backward connection issues next slide So some operational consideration so unmodified so on unmodified hosts are roasted or legacy hosts modified are ones that are upgraded. So unmodified host with modified routers, there's no change. Everything, everything 64-bit. Modified hosts with unmodified, routers, no change as well. And modified hosts with unmodified as well no change so only if both sides is supported, so the router side is upgraded, the hood is upgraded, then you can configure longer prefixes and only down to the slash 80. Next slide I do this in the final slide. Next slide So this is our operational consideration so we don't recommend using a mix of routers that are modified and unmodified And this is something actually, I don't have brought on it, maybe you can help chime in on this piece of it. I think this one, I'm a, myself didn't completely understand, but maybe you can on it, maybe you could help chime in on this piece of it.

You said this multiple times The boundary is defined elsewhere. Slack is variable length It doesn't use 64 in the document anywhere. So the lot of the premises here are wrong There's also, it seems to me, a lot of circular thinking here There's a lot of examples about why something new is different, because some employees implementations, I think you mentioned 3GPP a lot, are fixed have just somehow implemented slash 64 as a hard boundary but that's an implementation It's not a protocol problem. It could work otherwise. And the circular thinking is that you're proposing to change the protocols but that's not going to automatically fix all of those problems So I think it's sort of assume, you know, you're saying it's a hard problem, we need to do something different, but then assuming it's going, to be fixed and change anything, I don't think that works The other big problem, are one of many, I think there's a long list of things, but I'll let other people go, is that the notion you could have old and new devices on the same link besides being very fragile and complicated and hard to debug and all of that, that means you get no advantage"

I saw a lot of requirements like, well, ISPs require like slash 120s or longer and also the problem statement said neighbor discovery cache exhaust is a real problem.

If we think that these ISPs are not going to switch from 64 to 80, once everything supports 80, we are sorely mistaken The decision to provide the minimum amount of address space is a business decision. We have talked to those folks we know how they feel some of them are in this room right And so we cannot, we should not delude ourselves that's changing the minimum size will result in the ability for users to subnet. It won't it will just result in the minimum size of changing So I think we need to really think about that Tobias Sivich, Max Bank, Institute for Informatics, I'd like to echo some of these statements so especially the example in the draft that talks about neighbor discovery cache exhaustion in IxB in the draft, feels a little bit artificial given that on an IxB, you do have a relatively fixed number of people connected and you have a very strong sum on, like, whose Mac address is on there, so the growth of that network is basically determined by the number of members. So the case that is made doesn't really fit and that ties in with the general confusion so it seems in the drug a lot that it's confusing between what is relevant in access and what is relevant in the core which just just goes through it also the tie-in with various recommendations from the ripe region on how assignments are to be done are somewhat difficult in there especially given that in the ripe region we are facing problems or we have facing fears that if you, for example, have a more relaxed IPV6PI assignment policy people will start running ISPs on a slash 48 which then ties in with Lawrence's observation that if you give people the ability to have a slash 80 or longer, they will go for that So we have one more to go.

Appreciate it I RA lifetime metrics that we've collected in the wild And I would also like to apologize right away that this talk is not particularly refined I made the mistake of presenting these metrics to Jen and Lorenzo this morning, and here I am So, next slide So why do we care? All blame is entirely mine. If any mistakes are made in this presentation, it's my fault for telling Patrick, hey, you should present in 15 minutes minutes Right. So why do we care? So for mobile devices processing arrays is actually pretty expensive the CPU needs to wake up, and especially so little array lifetime which cause having to send a lot of arrays within a short period of time have an outsized impact on that and or a filtering offloads have to be based on the lifetime of the array. So that determines, yeah, so sort of how much battery you can save. So for right now, what Android does actually is we filter for the one-sixth of the renewable lifetime of an array. So if you get an array with lifetime 180 seconds, then we can filter that array for the time seconds. And this becomes even more of a problem now that we have multiple array sources in the network with the advanced of thread routers sending arrays as well So how do we do this?"

    "text": "We collected array data on Android 11 plus devices that think includes devices for multiple OEMs most Android devices actually It only includes networks to receive one distinct array, which sort of hand wavy maps to a single router. We do, we do receive one distinct array, which sort of hand wavy maps to a single router. We do like a partial byte match, we ignore some lifetime RB array, which sort of hand wavy maps to a single router. We do like a partial byte match, we ignore some lifetime, or we ignore lifetime sections and some other things so it's a bit hand wavy And for a given array option type, only the lowest lifetime value is recorded so if you have multiple RIS like 180 and 1800 then we report 180 for the lifetime of the RIO Obviously, zero lifetime values are not reported reported So this is probably the most interesting slide as far as our array filtering offload is concerned. This is the lowest value between the rather than lifetime, the PIO valid lifetime, and the RIO lifetime Here's, yeah, it's a bit rough so the second value is sort of an amazing implementation detail slash bug we were report, if router lifetime is zero, we see it to int max. So presumably this means that the second value here means router lifetime is zero and one, and both PIO valid lifetime or RIO lifetime are larger than that value. So they are probably set to you in 32 max, presumably I assume there are not many values between 2 billion and 4 billion that make a lot of sense So we we see that one seconds is actually quite common That's the 14.7 percentile here Surprisingly common 30 seconds which is incredibly expensive and probably does not work Yeah, next slide This is just a router live time"

I'm not sure if there's anything that we should call out here. Actually, a lot of networks seem to be using the RFC 4861 default of 1,800 seconds Here we have the PO valid lifetime those values are larger as we would expect expect Yeah, yeah, actually a lot of the UN32 max values there a lot of infinite values And here we have the RIO lifetime values and there actually a surprising amount of RIO lifetimes 23 or 22%, which set at 2180, which I don't know if the threat George Snack draft makes any recommendations, but maybe we can raise this Next slide. And here's somewhat related. We have some metrics on Detim period. It's somewhat related because the Detim, I don't know how familiar you are with client-side Detim skipping on mobile devices but essentially what happens is mobile devices do not wake up for every D-TEM broadcast Usually they skip, they only wake up for every NTH TTIP broadcast. And a lot of times this is dependent on the DTEM period configured on the AP So here, I guess one thing to note is, host app D actually sets defaults of D-tim period to, but it does not seem to be the most common value, so I guess presumably AP vendors configured as to one because they think it works better. I don't know DETEM is the period in which a Wi-Fi AP sends broadcast traffic"

    "text": "So, yeah, all Wi-Fi devices are expected to wake up on that period and listen to the broadcast So it is actually the period is multiple pi to begin interval, which is usually 100 milliseconds We do not have metrics on that. I'm presumably it's one milliseconds And next slide. One thing I guess before I take questions I would like to mention is that we also have upstreamed a Ciscuital, except array Lifetime, which we are, hoping to set to 180 seconds which will then cause to essentially the kernel to ignore any array lifetime or any array section lifetime that is below that value except zero But we're looking on feedback on that So if you have a better idea of what value we should set it to you to ignore any array lifetime or any array section lifetime that is below that value, except zero. But we're looking on feedback on that. So if you have a better idea of what value we should set it to, let us know questions yeah basically not not a question so better idea of what value we should set it to you, let us know. Yeah. Not a question. Not to you, but sort of a statement to the room. I think one thing to point out here is that I don't know what other OSS do, but Android kind of falls over itself It's like some super complicated filtering logic to make sure that we like listen to enough of these that we don't fall off the network, but we still allow the network to push configuration changes because if you can't push configuration changes you can't change anything and if you can't change anything, you have to do not remember like this is how it works in IP4 we don't have to change anything, so we have all of these static configuration protocols like DHEP, which can't be changed And we do, we survive because we have not, right? So I think it's very important that we actually are able to now the problem is there that, you know, all of these low light do, we survive because we have not, right? So I think it's very important that we actually are able to, now the problem is there that, you know, all of these low lifetimes are very expensive battery-wise. So I think we and we have this tension where, Android device manufacturers are incentivized to increase the DTIM skip from three to five or something because listening to the beacons is expensive and that in turn causes them to fall off IPV6 networks making IP less reliable"

One thing that we are doing is Android is we put this line in the sand. If you're less than 180, we don't care It's V4 only. And so that's something that maybe other vendors could consider whether they want to do that as well Because less than 180 is really just impractical from the battery perspective. So, yeah. Just wanted to say that. And, you know, as a working group, we should consider you know we're open for like 7084 update Maybe we can say something about Detim. Or maybe we should find out why people said D-TEM. I know that Apple was strongly arguing or Apple folks were strongly arguing for setting D-TM to three on action points. No one seems to do that Maybe we should find out why why right? Jen McGova, I quickly look at the data. I might be confused Like we did discuss 300 is very low lifetime right i can understand that operator might for some might set router lifetime and PIO lifetime to the same value so if your router disappear you address this disappear but if I'm not mistaken you see more data points with 300 PIO life your address disappear. But if I'm not mistaken, you see more data points with 300 PIO lifetimes that you see 300 router lifetime So it probably means like in some cases what? like PIO might be even like shorter than router life lifetimes. That's like interesting. I don't have any explanation for this just just curious. Yeah, what could it even? mean? Hi, Ten Chan Yeah, this is very interesting. Thank you"

Two things that come to mind. One is we're just restarting a revision of the IPV6 notion requirements RFT 8504. So that's might be a place in which we can put some of this sort of stuff and thinking in The other one is that there was a green boff earlier in the week and I wonder whether there's a draft in v6 o in which we can put some of this sort of stuff and thinking in. The other one is that there was a green boff earlier in the week and I wonder whether there's a draft in V6 Ox where there's a collection of b6 specific impacts on battery life. So it's not just this, there are other things the eyeball springs to mind, but there'll be other things as well that are causing a drain, maybe having some guidance for vendors implemented Yeah Thank you. Thanks, John Actually, I was going to come to talk about that, right? so back in I think like 2013 or so right like we found an issue with, like, some of these things, like on the, especially on wireless things for V6. One of the issues was the max router addressment lifetime. It was, like, fairly low. So we update 4861, I think it's like 8319 or something there's an RFC like nobody uses it right so like in a roundabout way of thinking, on Lorenzo's line, right? So imagine if like we have a configurable max router addressment lifetime and let's say like Tim puts it in the CRO router thing, and it stays pretty high we could kind of turn out the filtering for RAs I'm just throwing this out right like turn out the filtering for RAs we can also be responsive for config changes so because one of the things of filtering the arrays is that the conflict changes become difficult, right? So if the maximum road riders and lifetimes are high, and they are being, on packet loss probability so if Bob can tell you the whole history of this, right, the max router address and life was set based on packet loss probability So what we have in this RFC, the 8390, is that like look at the packet loss probability and then figure out, what the right after redressment lifetime should be so that it doesn't expect"

So I think if we can kind of go to that model where you expect the Routers to be less frequently sending multicast stuff, you can probably turn it off that filtering, get some cycles back for whatever other cool things you do, and then also be responsive to changes because there are can actually do a non-period array to kind of refresh the thing quickly Thanks So I think one problem though is that you do not know how often or how frequently the network sends you all right so you don't know if you can turn off the filtering right? But the filtering is pretty smart as in we if there's any change in any of them actually data, obviously we pass it, if there's like if the lifetimes increase we pass it if it's if it's to zero, we pass it. If it decreases to one-third of the original we pass it so like it's there's a lot of logic around that Thanks for doing this, Tim Winner's QA Cafe So a couple things, obviously, the CE-Rotter draft You know, CPEs are all over the map with this I'm sure you guys have experienced this, and there are operators who have this like in their head. One of them I recently talked to said, they were doing it every 10 seconds So I think if, you know well, they wanted it to it's kind of ironic, right? And I didn't realize you guys were doing this, right? Their logic was, is they had devices that were taking too long to come up, so they just spam the network. So, you know, I cautioned them not to do this, but not to do that. But I think, you know, definitely in the C.E. Rotter draft, I think Tim is a good point you know, as node requirements, too, maybe we should say some words about it this, obviously for battery networks, wireless ones, things where things are not plugged in, their general nodes I think we could put some words around that. C.E. router, I think we should definitely put some words around these lifetimes"

That kind of vaguely works, but it's awful to debug and the network behaves weirdly let's not recreate that and be only sending it to certain people, that kind of vaguely works, but it's awful to debug and the network behaves weirdly.

As I said, like, stupid ideas like starting with following too low recommendation of a network and when you see over time that is does actually not change that much so that you have a lot of redunding packets coming in, you increase your like filtering rates but stupid thought but the problem is that there's also detail so you're only receiving a certain amount of packets I don't know.

The other thing, that I think was also got stuck is that we're talking in Six-Man, you know, what was at the time Fernando's doc around, you know, Slack renom was like, it was like recommending Lauren in the lifetimes and I sort of realized a bit late that, you know, Detim basically just makes that a big problem. So yes, we do need to publish more guidance, but I think in general, I don't think, you know, that document had much of an effect. I mean, I suppose it gives Android grounds to say that 180 is just the minimum period. We can point to that doc and say, look, it's clear that you're doing it wrong, but I mean, I don't think people are really reading that doc, so I mean, yes, I agree we should sort of update with new well with you I did I did recommendations. I did, and a lot of people in my community that run massive Wi-Fi networks did Okay, thank you. Yes, I agree that we should update it when we should have more general recommendations I think One thing I wanted to say is for those people who are one thing I wanted to say is that for an OS like Android, which is sort of relatively sort of well, you know, well funded, right? Well, well funded, let's say, it is possible although difficult to build filtering that will actually accept the right packets and drop the package that we don't need this is what APF does.

So I'm looking at people you know, people that have maybe associated with, with consumer facing things like matter or thread, Ted and, you know, or whatever whoever else, right? Is like, if we can't fix the Detim skip problem, we really have we really have no good options here. There's no amount of smart code on device that will do this because the Detim skip is just like, I'm going to drop 50% of packets or I'm going to drop in the case of many well-known Android devices manufacturers, I'm going to drop 80% of multicast when you're dropping 80% of multicasts there's no amount of smart code that you can write that will make your device work well because statistics are just against you, right? Because 80% loss, you might sit there for an hour and drop off of them because the dice comes up like, you know, between one and four every time, right? So I think, you know, we really need to try to tackle this detain problem And I think getting, maybe getting the sort of the recommendation to do DTM to three on APs would help. But I think we need some sort of like marketing initiative that CP vendors actually care about for that.
