The over the sometime, the ITFLO has been accumulating 1 or 2 issues with RSC 8718. And we, made a pitch with a, a document at, IITF 116 Yokohama, along the lines of we would like the community to review RS a 718 and consider these things in its review. That was taken to Gen dispatch, and it was dispatched with this, take it to a mailing list, work on the various different art things and decide whether it's gonna from there, and I you know, Lars may decide to pick it up. Or whether it may need to go to a working group the took there was a lots of other feedback given at gender dispatch then the most important which one is that we cannot assume that people own umbrellas And we removed all of the parts that the LLC can just action because that was one of the bits of feedback, and we also, remove the parts that are not well formed. The the other big bit of feedback was that we didn't need to pitch this as we would like community to review. It was just go ahead and recommend changes to those things."

I've used entirely different numbers for actually the same things there. So, and I'll explain that bit in a second. So there are there are 4 sets of things within this draft. The first one, recommends a new policy to replace RSC 8719 the meeting rotation policy. This is new since gender dispatch. This has come from back directly from the community and has come from, the IETF chair as well about some consents about hit. So the Pacific concerns have been that the current meeting rotation policy doesn't distribute the pain well enough and, that it makes exploratory meetings too hard. To include The the the the feedback that we've had is that the in in the most recent draft, the proposed rotation policy is too strict and not workable. So that that will be withdrawn that the main issue was not to a new policy about it in place is to deal with the the requirement for IETF consensus for a an expiring meeting and to make that an LLC decision. But that was hidden inside some other tech and so I need to provide new text that then specifically addresses that point. So point of here is something that we we can discuss.

In other words, some people do not agree that close proximity can mean a 10 minute walk as I mentioned, you know, if you don't own an umbrella, then that can be a problem. And so, this is why we're proposing a tighter definition of it. That is that that simply just makes it clear to people that it is some that this is the boundaries of what it can be. Other thing is, replacing the requirement for the total room from one third of their projected attendees. To a much more flexible sufficient runs to meet the expected demand because you know, the the the the cost of the rooms, the location of the hope the venue, all of these things can affect the size of the room block and the the one third is simply too rigid. So we will prefer more flexibility there. And then finally, well, not quite finally, we have, a lot of things in there about overflow hotels. And it, I just wanna make clear in that that these are entirely optional feature. To have overflow hotels because the the currently it it's a it's pretty much a requirement that we have to have overflow hotels. But this all of these bits here come down to the changing nature of the way people are booking their accommodation know, that we have more and more people who are using Airbnb or equivalent services or going to cheaper hotels or these type of things. And we're simply trying to have 8718 more flexible to manage those things."

What I don't wanna have is somebody show up and say, the room block was full. By the time I went to book, therefore, you didn't meet this requirement. Which I'm sure is not what you intend. No. That that's what the word expected. Means. Okay, but the, you know, in in recent things we haven't met anywhere near the full size room block. Perfect. Thanks.

And so And I suspect there are a lot of people like this. Yeah.

So I don't want to we don't want to reduce it down to whatever size that means we're back to overbooking It's just there's a there's a gap between a comfortable level and the current even higher level. That we have now. It's just taking out that gap there. So that's why it's sufficient to meet expected demand. You know, we are explicitly stating that we want to have to make sure that there is a big enough room block so that what you happen to do does not know, what you're worried about doesn't Okay.

I do strongly agree that, making this, more actionable is is very valuable. I do wanna note that using 10 minutes to walk. Is in fact a little bit variable depending on how fast you walk and for some of us We may have no mobility issues, and this represents 1 distance and those with mobility issues, it may be significantly different So I I suspect it would be valuable to put in no more than 10 minutes walk or half a kilometer or something like that.

And and adding a distance in is actually great. Thank you. To consider that thank you. And I I will say it. I I think post proximity when we were talking about this some time ago, was meant to include you you could step on a tram and one tram stop later be at the right place.

I'm gonna make a comment, which will be in the rough, but I do not think that we should narrowly scope this to just the facility network and IT hotels network. So that should just be the network in the country. And the reason why is often those policies you put in place, you're violating the law. In the country. If you don't, if you do, if you access outside whatever filtering has already been mandated in the country. So I think it is a very strong mistake for us to have a separate filtering policy that we use inside our facilities versus what is used in the rest of the country.

I read some of this language, and I don't know how to craft it, but I'm wondering whether it captures when you talk about VPN websites and email the ability for folks to actually connect back to corporate kind of sponsors that make the participation of many of us kind of possible here. So, for example, I could read VPNs in a lot of different ways could mean a personal VPNI kind of provision versus kind of a corporate VPN. And I'm thinking the difference in in kind of policies that different com companies have. So love to capture the ability that I I can have the actual ability to connect back to my corporate resources from every place we visit.

The LLC took extensive legal advice by which, I mean, that we already have in house lawyers who are, standards to urban organization specialists, and we also used our litigation firm and had their antitrust litigators get involved as well so that we could get a really very broad set of legal advice. The internet society also took legal advice and took external legal advice as well. And we had a"

Is that the current policy set of the IETF provides strong mitigation of antitrust risk and there is no requirement for a new policy on this. However, We don't have anything that is labeled anti trust that people can point to and say, right. This is our actual official explanation of how our policy set. Does this, nor do we have any guidance saw, participants that, would be useful for them to to understand, you know, on on a personal basis. And so and it will be helpful to have that document. So, you know, the the the view of the litigators was, not necessary Should we ever be, you know, in a litigation position, but health And the other thing was that ultimately, of course, no IET dotchem provide legal advice to participants. It's simply providing, you know, helpful information table, Now there was a a buff about this in 2013, as Joel would like me to remind people the 20 13, a boss is not decision making, but the outcome of that boss was, to, have a, an informational document, and this is consistent with that 2013 BAF.

One is how these points might be weaponized by IETF participants. That's one of the biggest concerns that people have is that they will be used to stifle what is entirely legal, what is entirely normal discussions about things. And the second one is that the points need to be really clear so that they mean the same thing to all readers. I don't know about you, but I've throughout my life of writing things, I'm always eyes that people would not understand what I've written really clearly. You know, and, yeah.

So under 4.2 topics requiring caution, We have, the current text which is using detailed date, blah blah blah. You know, the bits in bold are the bits that people are unhappy about. But detailed is not the point here. About using market data. It's about whether or not that is public market data or not. If it's public market data, it's in highly appropriate to have a a discussion about it if it's private market data, that's where there's significant antitrust risk is.

You you will you must do this or you must do that. Okay. So, like, if somebody gets up at the mic and says that not what to say somebody basically evaluate relative implementation costs Okay? Yeah. So if somebody says, you know, the implementation of cost of thing of this is, you know, wildly different from that one, and I've used data. I cannot share to do that with you.

And that causes this to be a problem. So I would prefer I realize this is just one of caution. That if we're going to use market data that we give a citation to some well known definition of what market data means or we provide more guidance that implementation complexity is still permitted as a discriminator between 2 different technical proposals. So even if it's even if it is data where the particulars of the implementation cannot be disclosed. Okay. So so two two things there, as I understand from the lawyers, that is the appropriate phrase to use without citation and stuff. Okay? But it may be that I will take that back to to to get that advice, you know, explore that more. But it may be actually better to tackle this by being a explicitly clear that what you are talking about is not market data.

That, you know, engineers come to these discussions very clear rules that they can look at in isolation and derive, you know, what I should how I should behave.

I mean, not really this is almost a performative It's to show, look, the IETF has thought about antitrust and competition law, and we have a document that's not quite a policy, but it has some policy flavors to it. And I think maybe getting more of that context into the document or, or, or, setting expectations from the the technical readers about how they should use the document might be helpful. And, and in addition to the point of weaponization, the only other thing I'd bring is that anything that looks even vaguely like it would wire or or create an expectation that a working group chair or an IETF chair or anyone else or or an LLC.

And I think that private in this contact and you can probably wordsmith with the lawyers to make this clear. Refers to conversations that are within the INTF context but are private.

I think what's not quite as clear to me, and I going back to what Mark Nottingham was saying lawyers who are talking to you about risks they're not talking to you in bright terms of absolutes. There's a question that comes up when the IETF provides a facility that's then used for something that's not actually kosher according to to to these rules. And I I think the question then is what counts as the IETF providing the facility. So If if there's a risk to us because we make side meeting rooms available that can be foreclosed discussion of this type, then that may be risk level, alpha according to, the, the lawyers.

And meetings in in rooms that made it make available must public. Okay. So the the risk is here. So I've seen people's quad on, for example, the IV office, which is slightly booked. Right? So it's a room that we rent from the hotel and people can just like walk in and have a meeting. I think that is risk a little wise, probably something. Like, she said, could just walk into a room without the So to to we we went through this in some detail with our lawyers. Okay.

I have an incentive involvement in Etsy and in Etsy and then from 3gpp. And, from that, you'll summarize that it it's obviously in a very heavy IPR environment. And there's a lot of money and a lot of litigation potentially floating around. So the general premise that we adopt absolutely no IPR discussions connected with the meeting, and the rules say they're there is no IPR discussion whatsoever in the meeting. Obviously, of course,"

So, I mean, perhaps perhaps here because We don't really have much IPR floating around. We judge the potential is lower but maybe we we we should consider that sort of course of action in saying that no IPR descriptions whatsoever take place in our native meetings all facilities. And then if if they do, it's it's coincidental. And but at least the the IETF as an organization has tried to protect itself against against being involved in any future IPR litigation. Thank you, Simon. Two things. First of all, the, they they they I discussions like are are a necessary part of the IATF process. And there is a very clear document or set of documents about how those are necessary and apply to it. We, I had you know, the roomful of lawyers look at these specific cases. And in in each case, there was very good reason as to why that is not related to us, but that was a particular specific thing that was done within those other SDOs that we don't do that created that vulnerability there for those things.

But all the current actions that you're hearing about in in competition law are around non IPR forms of of abuse of dominance. And and I think we we may do well to start thinking. And then, and maybe it won't be very much in this document, but we would do well to start thinking about what is our role in non IPR forms of abusive dominance? When somebody stands up and says, well, I'm done with this market, and I'm gonna you know, not let you do that, for example.

And highlighting those and, and, and connecting to the things like the Open Stand principles. Right. You, Mark. I I think as you know, the abusive, a dominant position exists in European law, but doesn't really exist in US competition law. And whereas US competition law is very much focused on cartels and trust elements there.

I'm not gonna go through this, but it it's it's a very reasonable set of these things are, appropriate to use. I had a a revision that I highlighted some things, but that's obviously not been uploaded. Many of these, if not, almost all of these are connected to those criteria we've talked about in 2026. Next slide. And and and the document also contains non criteria, things that are out of that scope. And, again, if you take the trouble to read through this, it's it's quite sensible. Next slide. That's all the art charts. There's also a position called abstain. Which interestingly has 2 different meetings. It's, I cannot support sending this document forward, but there there's 2 you know, reasons given for that. One is I'm so strongly opposed that I'm unwilling to discuss. So you're effectively, putting your foot in the ground. And the other is I opposed this document, but I understand that others differ, and I'm not gonna stand the way. So there's a little bit of conflict because it can mean either I feel incredibly strongly about this, and I'm I'm setting a bar that needs to be exceeded. Or what I think I've seen in in many cases has been called a non blocking abstain. Which is kind of an informal instrument that says, I'm kinda cool with this, but kinda not. So I'm just gonna say abstain. And, and, and I actually spent some time, looking through all of the different discusses and abstains in the last 5 years. And this is used very inconsistently. Next slide. And then there's a piece of text. Martin, do you wanna talk now or later? I I just have brief comments. So actually have a third reason for you. You. Okay. I have a third reason for it. D doing a stain, which is like, I really don't like this document, but but I've no discussed criteria that that expresses my my disdain for it."

So there's guidance in in the document as well saying no to a document, and and and this walks through, you know, generally, if you wanna say no, you use the abstain and apparently that's the first kind of abstain, I think. But sometimes you really, really wanna say no, and so you use a discuss And that is from what I can tell in the text and the document, I discussed that you never wanna remove. And that was done to me once, by the way. And and this is called a backstop function of the IESG. Which is is really interesting because that's not referred to in 2026. And so the nature of that b back stuff is a little bit unexplored here. Next slide. So all I know you've got comments, Lars. So I I wanna I wanna refer you back to the term technical omission. Okay. And so, uh-uh, in general, if if you look at a really high level, you know, you've you've got the the criteria in 2026 and then the ballot in criteria. And and I would characterize the the 202626 as as generally object criteria. It's talking about things like technical quality and clarity and lack of technical emissions. And, yes, each of those is somewhat a judgment call, but they are more objective than things phrases that are used in the balancing criteria, like good conscience or beliefs And and I think there's there's a little bit of a division there. So so next slide. And so when I was thinking about this, I, I think the problem statement that I'd currently characterize here is is that the Discussed criteria are treated as an authoritative document. But they're not grounded in community consensus. They were created by the ISG. And I'm sure that there was a a degree of consultation in that process. But there's not an opportunity for the community to reopen that discussion."

You know, it's hard to say that this is a, we have due process if there are parts of it that are opaque or or or out of the community's control. Next slide. Do you wanna talk now, Colin? Yeah. I just wanna comment on that one a a a little bit. Sure. Their answer. I I think that everybody would agree that if if there if something was done claiming it was a discussed criteria. Anyone felt that it did not meet the requirements of 2020 You could instantly appeal it on those grounds because 2026 is the thing. And to discuss criteria, were designed to greatly, greatly limit the power of the g from what had been available in 2026 by itself. And there are they, I think, are largely today are a voluntary statement made by individual ADs that they're willing to be bound the discuss criteria. To, to sort of further get that. So I just like get that con I don't wanna make it sound like the discuss criteria. Allow the ISG to block things that 2026 wouldn't allow them to block I don't think that's the case. And if we disagree there, we should we should make sure we're on the same page before we go forward. I I think it's really interesting how you put that because while it's it's true that if if I, you know, and and very aware of the process and confident in my position in the IETF. I can point that out and make that appeal, it doesn't happen. Most people don't have the awareness, and I especially new authors and people who aren't frankly the people in this room. Don't have that awareness that the discussed criteria have a different characteristic than 2026."

And and you look at that, if if you compare the actual discusses and and abstains that are made in the record, which is interestingly, very hard to extract. Yay Python. Then then you you start seeing a mismatch. And and and if you look at the appeals that we've had over the last 5, 10 years. That process is not well exercised. So I I don't know that that's healthy. Agree. It's not understood and agree not exercised. And on and so you're you're saying, and you're looking at the last 5 years' worth of discusses, you think there's ones there that were not would not be allowed under 2026 and were claimed under this criteria. That's fascinating. I would love to see that list and discuss with Namcom. Thanks. Sure. Well, that's and and I think that would be very interesting to have that exercise. Yeah. I'm still I have very rough data. I need to chunk it a lot. Yep. Yep. So next slide. And so I kinda split this up into kind of 3 options of how we might move forward. One is the status quo. And that is, I think, what we kind of just discussed. We rely on the appeals process and the recall process and then on come to, act as a counterbalance. To to these these forces. And and and ISG would remain in control of its its internal processes. Think the downsides here are that as I is talking about there is a conflict 2026 and the dust discuss criteria potentially. And and as we just talked about the appeals and recall processes are seldom exercised, I and and and then really the heart of this in in some ways for me is is that, you know, we we select people, the non complex people based upon technical judgment. And if if you see nontechnical judgment, personal judgment being size to acknowledging that there is a continuum there in Sometimes it's very cloudy, which is being exercised. That creates the need for different selection criteria."

We'll have the discussion If after that discussion, we haven't resolved it, we can go say, hey, wait, this really doesn't meet the discuss criteria. You need to drop that. And that's generally been effective. We have 2 mechanisms to kill and discuss that an AD won't remove, and neither of them have been necessary to to to be used. Yes.

I I I think probably I'll respond to a couple because that'll flick, flesh out things, and then we'll go from there. I think that, there are some issues in this process that need to be teased out. There's a lot of culture built around it and and subtle practices that are common knowledge in the ISG. And completely opaque to the rest of the community unless their X IESG. And as a result, it's it's a secret knowledge. And, and that's causing friction.

And, like, I feel like we need to have another rabs thing. We don't have time. Time for now, and I'd be happy to do that with you offline. I I I would love to talk about abstains. They are Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we can we can we can go there some other time. We don't have time today and Fascinating. North luckily for you. This is Murray. I'm not wearing a hat, but I am wearing a badge. To Pete's point about appeals, I have been holding a discuss close to a year now. Both sides of that appeal have said if you don't do something about if One side said if you do let this go, I will appeal it. The other side saying, if you don't let this go, I'm going to appeal it. Would one of you please appeal it? So that it's no longer on me. Second, you had a bullet up there that said, on technical criteria. I just had my non primary interview and they ask me almost no technical questions. It's much more of a uh-uh, sorry, a personality test? Like, do you fit and will you take the IHTF in the direction we want it to go? So if this chips away at my discretion to use discusses, by pulling away all that. There's one of the things you list you list all the criteria, but there's a sentence above it that says, this is not an exhaustive list of when you can use them. If that gets constrained further, then I am more restricted from from being able to do my job in my view effectively."

Well, and I think maybe that's if if we have a dream in the community about what your job is, I think everything would improve here. And I some people think that it should be more mechanical and that you need to respect community consensus more. Others think that, no, we need these heroes to stand up and make sure that the right thing happens. Truth is maybe somewhere in between. But I think we should have agreement on that. I That's fair. I think that I should be have the ability to nudge things in a certain direction. That's why non comps me over my Right. Of the others. And maybe this is just about how much notch. Sure. What you just said made me feel more comfortable than everything that was set up to that point. So Well, I'm I'm I'm glad to serve, Murray. Con. So colon jokes. Two things I wanna comment on. 1st we keep discussing appeals, I'd like to point out that Pete pointed out earlier. There's actually 2 mechanisms for clearing a discuss, the second one, far less known than the other one. So, you know, the recall should be made, you know, people should be aware of that process is there as well. Oh, there's a dis there's a discuss clearing Oh, 3 discuss. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Right. No. No. Tell me more. Let me tell you more. And David, 2026 does not limit the recall process in any way. So feel free to use it. Next, on more important things. The Murray's begging you. That's Okay. Back, I wanna talk about abstain for the upstamped position for a second, because I think that that has caused a lot of grief as well at at times and and clearly Marcus said that earlier. So I I take a very functionalist approach to this. I think that the most important thing is we need to make it easy for ADEs that have found themselves in a rough or uncomfortable position in the way that people get themselves there."

And that if that allows them that means having a place where people can say, you know, I hate your baby and it's ugly, but I'm gonna let you have it anyway. That's fine. I don't care. If that's the thing that's important to me is we make the internet better by getting the RFC out I could care less what's in the data tracker. Okay? Okay? And I think that's a really important reason. Like, we talked about why they're this 2 types of abstains that are very, like, very different reasons and very blurred together. That's great. That's a feature and not a buck. We don't wanna differentiate those 2. We want to publish the document. So anything that allows us to publish the document in the outstanding category and get past that is a good thing. And the fact the engineering part of us wants to differentiate the flowcharts of these processes No. This is not about an engineering flowchart. This is about human but humans how they work and what the easiest way is to allow somebody step backwards from some perhaps bad position and get to place where we can publish the document. And I I'd like us to retain that aspect of it. I'm staying. Sure it could be improved. We could get better ways to do it or or something like that. But I I do think that that's that that the Weirdness of all of that is a feature not a bug when it comes to abstain. As long as you define your objective metric, as as my document gets published, not anything else, and I think that that's the right metric. So it's a I want to second that. So the the escape valve, function of the obtain is highly underrated and and incredibly useful. There there is a wrinkle here where sometimes we have documents that get so many abstains that they failed to have the the required number of ballots actually get So that is a a deadlock state that we don't wanna talk about you now because we don't have time, but this this the the exactly. When is the last time that happened, I can't recall. Well, anyway, look, I I I think 2026, let me comment"

And that is a special form of No. No. And it was carefully designed carefully designed to make, you know, individual person can say no and certain types of You can't say no. And we, you know, we narrowed and sliced off in all kinds of ways many of the ways that we've had before, like, I mean, You know, all those things in that discuss criteria, like the IO IOU discuss? Like, they're in there for a reason. Okay? There was like Hey. I have a problem with your document, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is. And 2 years later, it I'm making up the 2 year's number, but substantial amounts of time later. The IOU had not been delivered. Right? Right? Like, it really did make things better. Like, everything's in there because it was a behavior we had seen in the past. So Sure. Understand. But but we're not fighting that war anymore. No. Of course. Yeah. Hi, Colin Perkins, speaking as an individual and speaking as an individual who has declined the AD nomination many times. So we we've been having a conversation that talks about two people. Talks out the off. Talks about the offers and the ASG. This is actually a free party conversation. We have the offers the working group chairs and the ASG. I'm concerned that we are having these that there seems to be this debate going on between the offers and the ISG where the offers are getting stuck and the working group chairs are not stepping in and saying, Hey, something is going wrong here. We should be having a broader conversation. And if we have working group chairs who are not willing to have that conversation with the ASG, then this is telling me something about the way we are appointing our training working group chairs that maybe we should be looking into rather than necessarily revising the discuss criteria. I didn't agree with that. I think it's about both the education, the work group chairs and the power dynamic between them and the eighties."

Maybe a little point that you, when you you did that during your presentation, you said the ISG create and discuss criteria. Well, ISG changes every year. When I saw the Discussed criteria time around 2009, I just looked at it and decided, okay, it's good enough. And even though it the decision to qualify it was done by different set of people. You know, and this group of people kind of grows over time because there are more area of directors and the XADs over time. So the other thing is, Just cause criteria hasn't changed, really. So I I tend to think that I disagree with people that we shouldn't codify because I don't see any the process, and I think we should just write it down. In RFC as far as the, whether when you do this in a working group or not, maybe we should start by analyzing differences between 2026 criteria and discussed criteria. As a first step. So that might be worth spending some time on whether it's like design team or working group or both. I don't know. Alyssa Cooper I was also intrigued by your comment about abstains. Some of the scrounge has already been trodden. But, but also, you know, Martin's sort of like, we can talk about that separately. I actually think these things are like, very interconnected.

    "text": "My pet peeve about the abstain is that if you look in the dictionary about what it means to have seen, it means to to not vote. To not take an action. And often people abstain, and then there continues to be further engagement with the Diner, which is literally what I what you said What what you said? Is that gut stained? And yet, like, you get drawn in and people are trying to convince you to change it and whatever. Right? And so I think it's actually like quite a delicate matter because I know that, there's some you know, discomfort with the content of what goes in abstains. And maybe there's something to be done about that. But it's as Colin said, a very valuable tool to not have to continue to engage. With with someone who objects to your document. And yet people don't treat it that way. It's like, it could be really valuable. Doesn't get treated that And There have been these cases where there were not enough valid positions to get the document unblocked. And sometimes that's because of the number of stains is sometimes just because the number of abstains plus no ballot. And And maybe that's a a blocking condition that we wanna take take another look at. But I I think the upstate is seriously misunderstood and underutilized And it could help relieve some of the the, the pressure around discuss, if that were fixed. The other thing that the whole, you know, not having enough ballots. Problem shows you is the lack of incentive for the ISG to work as a team. Which is like a pervasive problem in the entire operation of the ISG. It is really not incentivized in any way to work as a team and So when you you get these dynamics with, like, one person holding out with their discuss, or too many abstains, There's there's nothing that drives the ISG towards owning decisions collectively.

Or it should because just solving this for, like, individuals who are staking out their own claim, is probably not the best way to solve it. On the last point, we have data tracker functionality now shows you as an AD on your dashboard where the are documents that are missing ballots that you have embedded on, and it's trying to nudge you to do so. Does it work? It's too soon to tell. It's been a couple of weeks only, but, we have it now. It's been a couple of weeks only during which time we had no, ASG telechats. It's working for some of us is what I'm hearing. Just to respond very briefly, I thank you all this. That's, incredibly insightful I think that's you know, what are we designing this system for and, and what outcomes do we want is the important question to be asking. So thank you. And, and to the point of a dashboard, there maybe be a dashboard for the community too. Yeah. Does a freshman AD, I guess. So so I'm fairly new to this process. So so I haven't seen many long term problems on discusses. You look at the process of getting a discuss cleared, if you if it gets constrained to such a point where I don't really can't discuss anymore. Then you're just going to move the problem in an even less visible area, which is called AD follow-up. For instance, we now have a documented test, like, I don't know, 300 hyperlinks in it. We, some people think it's way too much to make the document unreadable. I had to discuss on that. Which would probably technically fail your discuss criteria and I indeed changed it to a comment, and now it's with the responsible AD under AD follow-up, and now you've got like, like the AD has sort of said, they will not do anything with this document until this issue has been solved, but it's not even marked anywhere that we're discussing this."

So, not looking forward to trying that. But, hopefully, we can do better this particular area if we're a bit more careful about what we put I think the the community should should actually, you know, if if I think there's a fundamental question in separate ways. Like, what is the role of the ISG? Should the ISG be able to block something indefinitely or is is the role of the ISG basically to check whether the community has done a reasonable job, but otherwise get out of the way. Right? And and I I think 2026 is pretty clear what the ISU should do. And if there's a change in liquidity on on that role of the ISG, I think we we should be very clear about it, and we should actually talk about what That's the community you think the IC should do. I, can I just ask that, the ISGB very conscious that it's gatekeeper? It it's a gatekeeper function. Right. And so if if we do have a discussion and we do come up with another boss proposal, if it's denied, the reasons will be better than the denial that we had before.
