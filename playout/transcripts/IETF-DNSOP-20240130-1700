    "text": "part uh next slide um and the other uh unknown for me is like if we put all this name server capabilities in the D Record at the parent the problem is that if the name server does something that changes its capabilities the name server itself in its own zones cannot fix that so if it accidentally rolls um an Acme certificate and the uh and the Upstream D Record says you know you should expect this certificate but now it's that certificate or it's a different CA um then there's this whole process of how do you get this updated so that is for me a reason to say the DNS capabilities sorry the name serfer capabilities should actually be advertised in the zone that belongs to the name server so it can update it itself and without external dependencies um so that means something like um an svcb or D record on the name server name instead of on the parent at the Zone which I understand some people are not a big fan of um but again is this really a many additional queres so one argument is that it takes many more queries to find out all these this information about the capabilities of the name server down at the name server Zone but remember most name servers serve millions of zones so that amortization of the name server capability you get back over a large amount of zones so I don't think it's actually that many queries even if it's like four additional queries per name server name then those are all usable for like you know a million domains so I think there needs to be a maybe a bit more discussion about um the disadvantage and the advantages of moving the name server capabilities from the from the as a Zone data to a name server property next"
