Using list persistence. And then what it's new in this version and the latest version that we have uploaded is is the multi homing support. For the rest of presentation, I'll I'll focus on multi homing support the rest. We've presented sometimes Okay. We use multi home in support. The the idea is that the lease pharmacy specification, talks about how to zoom with the humming and especially RSC's 93100 and 90, 301. But for l 2, multi homing, we we need some additional mechanisms that are introduced in this in this document. Okay. The first thing that we need when we do well to Montecomming is and we discussed these multiple times, in the past is we need an fire, so that XDRs can understand that they are multi homing, they are part of the multi home group that that is providing multi home to to a side. And after discussions, what we did is we settled with site ID. We discussed this previous meetings and also in the in the list. What I'm covering here is the text that we added to to specify that what we agreed on. Okay? Also relevant, once we are doing and since we are settling on this identifier,"

There are multiple aspects, but there is one that it's particularly relevant relevant Okay. Then the first mechanism that is special of L2 MultiHoING is Fear XTR discovery. When we are doing L2 multi homing into into an l2 site, something that we want is that all the XDRs discover each other. This is relevant to do something like roadcast for water or or the split horizon filter. Okay. Okay. To this end, what we have done is we have the find a special ID that will be used for this purpose. Especially IDs, distinguished name, that has a string, like, where it's 65 here, where we say L2 SDRs and and we use the or we paste the site IV of of the site that is being multi home. In order to avoid collisions, what you are going to do is is user reserved instance ID where this is going to be registered into and to particular things about this registration, they must be always done with the merge request it set. Okay. This is so that the mapping system merge merges all the Rlocks from all the XDRs that are registering, and it should all also always set the 1 month notify. Right? This is so that every XDR is notified about others being part of this multi hunger with respect to a mapping system, what we need is that the mapping system stores the aggregated list of hard locks that are registering this this specialty ID."

Another special thing that we need for l 2 multi homing is to select the designated forwarder, this will be the guy that is responsible to send broadcast traffic to and from remote sites. To this end, what we are doing is leveraging the multicast priority fields in the hard log records. What we are going to do is that each XTR can set a particular priority. Putting itself in dranking itself, let's say, in in a list to be designated for order. And then the the signature for water will be the one with them. Vest at because priority. A across all of them. If we have a collision, let's say, will people have the same and priority, the outlook address will be dibreak, Yeah. Just as an example, right, we have these 2 XDRs, a 182 both register 1 with Ewan is registering with better, Music priority is going to be the one selected. Next one is the split horizon. The what, draft says is that all XDRs must implement proper split horizon mechanisms to to avoid especially, to protect against wolves and also avoid sound duplication in broadcast suffolk, Suffolk, in order to do this, what the XTS can do is since they receiving the list of all our logs of all XDRs that are multi homing to these l two sites, they they can use this list to to install proper filters in in in the router.

We may not be so dependent on it. And this is the example I was talking about before. One of the reasons, for example, we want to make sure that all the IDs are registered with the same site ID. Is for example, right, when we want to distinguish between registrations that belong to multi homing. Case and mobility case. Let's say that you have a host that it's moving from a side that it's multihomed, right, and to a side that it's not multi home or some other multi home site. Can how can we make sure that having system and all the XDRs understand when the registration, needs to be aggregated and it's part of home of the home side, or or it's actually around the they situation. And this is where we use the side ID. For example, the mapping system, what what we would establish is that when registrations come with merge request bids and same site ID, the the registration will be merged and all our logs, are understood as belonging to a multi home site. When the registration comes with a different site ID, then the locator set must be replaced. And and we understand that it's a movie to the case. XDRs would do the same, based on the analogue list that they have received, the you're able to distinguish between from the way the events and and and more the home registration units.

As I said before, we finish with the comments. Yeah. We can always reorder them. Dino was interviewed. So a couple questions. When you said multi homing and the split horizon check, you said for broadcast. You also mean unknown as well. Yeah. That's Is unitCast that in the spec? Wherever you say broadcast in the spec, do you also say? Should. Yeah. I think I should extend. Yeah. I just assuming, but, yeah, it's it's a Okay. And you refer to split horizon, but you don't actually say how it works. No. Because now I'm wondering how it works, Oh. Because there's one forwarder that then sends it to all other sites, that are part of the same VLAN. Mhmm. But it also come back to the XTRs for that site where the source is. Right? So first question is, we are going to load up the underlay with packets that are gonna come back to the site that are gonna Give me drop by. Yeah. The ETR is not that site. That's unfortunate. Yeah. Yeah. And and that's But can the ITR know that it shouldn't replicate to the other our looks because it knows it's part of its site from the discovery. Mechanism, mechanism, So they don't even leave the site. They they'll never come back as the question. It's probably more efficient to do it that way. Yeah. Right.

I don't know. There may be but but but but Oh, actually, if if the underlay does multicast, you're gonna have it's gonna be more inefficient Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It is, because is the underlay multicast group mapping to all broadcast or all unknown because Yeah. That that's the problem. Right? So, Normally, you switch to multicast when I would say when you have a lot of XDRs, So I think we need to spec that carefully because there's a lot of details there that aren't clear But if the underlay is if we're replicating unicast on the underlay, the ITR could have when it gets back from the mapping them could be all the our looks to all the other sites for the VLAN except for the other uploads in the same site. That would have the local list. You can filter that out be really good. Since we have the local list. Yeah. We before cache. Yeah. That's you put it in the map But then when you map a tow, multicast. It's okay because you're gonna hit everybody else. And these guys. So there's a source based solution a receiver based solution when the underlays won't be there. Yeah. I'll document that in the next version. Yeah. It's really Okay. So I have a question. Actually, when I was reading the doc, is something that was interesting when you talk about the cash miss Okay. So it really looks like this this this Brooke. Scale change. Is not without packet loss. Right.

So I'd like 2 you know, kind of basically go and relook at that piece. Whether whether you can use that information and forward it directly so that the never get. You never get cash miss.

We have a short tutorial and, also a survey on, p 4 technology that has been, published earlier this year. Here's the reference on the bottom line. So how does people work?

To, to program an SDN controller that, communicates with the switch over the p 4 run time, which uses the grpc calls to, to control the switch the the the the forwarding paradigm here is table based. That means packets are processed, using tables. You have, some key that matches a certain packet and, with this key and action is associated and also action parameters, which are then applied the packet That is the basic principle of, P4. So, how does the before list browser architecture look like. Here. You have the gray box. The gray box is basically a white box switch. On the bottom, we have the p 4 data plane. Hear them. These packets are forwarded the p 4 controller runs on the same white box. So there's very little delay between p 4 data plane and the controller. And this control controls the p 4 to auto plane through this p 4 run time. The p 4 controller controls, communicates with the LISP control plane lispace.net, via local sockets, And, So how does this work in action? On the left side on on the slide, you see host one that communicates over ITR 1 and ETR 2 with host 2. So the first packet"

So the the mapping will be retrieved from the mapping system and only then ticket can be forwarded to ETR 2 does that mean in the lisp router architecture? In this p 4 list browser architecture. That is explained on the right side. So we see the host one issuing a packet that arrives at the p 4 list router, it is received by the p 4 a plane, and no mapping is in the people forwarding table. So this entire packet is then forward to the p 4 controller. Which is on the same white box switch. That extracts the destination EID And forward it over the local summit to the to to the list control plane, list.net. That one retrieves the required mapping from the global mappings mapping system, and, returns it to the p 4 controller, which then installs the mapping in the in the in the forwarding table. And from then on, the list packets can be forwarded So that's the basic principle. Here is some sketch that it's not only a single forwarding match action tables that is employed in this, software. This these are, 6, forwarding tables just for the XTR. And as we also implement RTR and PXTR, the entire software implementation, looks rather like this one. So What about evaluations?

No. The way, we can also use the P4tg. That's a P4 based traffic generator. Which is able to do 10 times 100 gigabit per second, which also runs on the P4 hardware. So Next, we also conducted functional unit tests. We have, tested different deployments, namely XTR PXTRs and RTRs. And we also implemented some security features. For instance, when a mapping for a certain EID is requested, that should not be requested within the next, second. Because otherwise, we get too much load on on the p 4 controller Then we restricted the list packets to a certain range of source EIDs to avoid misuse and, to limit the potential for for a dose attacks And in the same way, we also limited the the range for, destination EIDs. Many other extensions are also supported by the implementation like not traversal mobile load and list not. And, when we need, double encapsulation like, for mobile node, this is done in a single packet cycle. So this runs at line rate. And also, decapsulation and re encapsulation what we need for the RTR This also runs at line rate. So"

To to evaluate that, we send 1000 packets with different destination IP addresses when no mapping is available. So to test the controller performance, we sent those 1000 packets, a different, a different rates. So when we send them with 100 packets or 125 packets, per second. We saw no increased latency, to get the to to get the answer. But when we send 150 packets per second, then we saw that the latency rises, but we did not see any packet loss yet. So we can say that performance is somewhere between 10100 between 1251150 packets per second. So it's different EIDs that can be retrieved. Because only a specific EIT is retrieved only, once per second, and All other requests would be dropped directly on the data plane. So here's the conclusion, p 4 list. Is a high performance list browser implementation for data rates. Around 100 gigabit per second. This is on the Tofino 1 and on the Tofino 2, this is, 400 gigabits per second It's an open source implementation, and it leverages the open source control plane lispersed.net.

Would you consider doing this for multicast. Well, we do multitask on tofino, but we haven't done this for for lisp. We did that for beer. So various flavors of beers. Hi. Mark Sysco. I think I saw, I think on one's live view, we were saying that your limit, fund rate to one bucket per second. And and then you had that performance slide where you say you reached 105th the packets for a second. Obviously limits different places or So, we when you have a specific EID, you can request the metric for that specific ERT only once per second. Okay. But, of course you can request multiple different EITs within a second, because you want to resolve, many EITs,"

    "text": "and that needs to be done instantly Oh, okay. So, for a specific EID, only a single packet is forwarded to the control plane. Okay. So so you filter for destination, you you're able to readily meet on a per destination basis. We we filter it directly on the data plane to protect the control plane. Because as you saw, the control plane supports, 125 packets per second. Just just different requests. And when you, start a stream, constant bit rate to a certain EID and you would forward all of them to the control plane. The control plane would be immediately, overloaded Okay. And that's and just bringing it home with any plans to implement the idea ability support. I mean, the this would detailed detection, right, not not just resolving remote dialysis, but detecting what it's locally connected to you. Not sure what they're asking. No. Yeah, the draft that I just presented, yeah, the rest of the draft talks about, detecting local hose and and when they move around, just conversing the network for that. Into that. Just just just just Mhmm. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. I have one quick Claudio you you showed only examples with the ipv4 is also ipv6 implemented. Did you try to and I IV 4 AIDs, ipv6 something like that, or it's just IPV for I think we have implemented only IP before. Okay. Just do this. Okay. Thank you. Next. Dino. This."

    "text": "Share. You can the King Price Okay. gonna present the list group mapping draft. I'm And, my colleagues from Cisco of Prasad wind and sticks in the room I think Prasad's unlike So just a a brief refresh of list multicast. What is it? It really comes in two forms in the early days in 60 831 figured a way of mapping an overlay multicast to an underlay multicast. And what we did is we just distinguished between on EID, that was a source in our look, that was the source, which is the encapsulator. What that draft defined was based on receiving PIM joint messages or IGMP reports, how you would tell the ITR that this state exists. So we could then forward, pin joint messages to the source in the source domain. So what we introduced was this new overlay state. We we used it in the regular multicast, we call these Eskomajes for source trees or starcomaje. But since we have 2 layers of forwarding here, we had to introduce the term EIDcomagie in 6831 back in the day. And, of course, the encapsulator was the rlocamajeek, but note that g was exactly the same. In both. That's what this draft is going to address. And then in 8378, we said, well, if you don't have underlay multicast, can we still have overlay multicast. And we could do that by replicating to unicast our looks. And the way we did that in a 378 was using the mapping system. 6831 did not use the mapping system. It used PIM. So the ETR could talk directly to the ITR out of band. So it wasn't it would it would 83 or 6831 was very dependent on PIM."

    "text": "To help the signaling, and that's why we called 8378 signal free. Because it didn't do any protocol signaling. You used the mapping system as a database. And in that draft, we also introduced an arloq set that can contain both unicastarlokes multicastarlopes. So you can then you could replicate to places in the network in the underlying network that had multicast enabled in other places that didn't. Okay? So what this draft actually does is it's formalizing the terminology, this 22 Tupelo multicast state, which we called eskammagee. And so the overlay state has seid and GEID now. Okay? And the reason is is because now the overlay group could map to different underlay groups, in the underlay because it's being supported by a provider that wants to have that are being used K. So what we call the SE ID is the source that's sending the packets. And the GE ID is the group address that the source is sending to. And that receivers that are on the overlay would join. Okay? So the underlies know nothing about these EID addresses just like it doesn't know it. For them for unicast. And SEID and GID are registered They can also be registered as prefix is not as, like, slash 30 twos for ipv4. So you can actually aggregate the mapping system by having a collection of sources in a power of 2 prefix, and then they use a group range, which is in a power 2, group prefix as well. Okay. Now the r look notation we use is interesting because we called it SR Loc. An s r loke is basically the encapsulating ITR source address. Okay, And, I guess we just could have called that in our look, but we wanted to be able to distinguish that. So the destination, though,"

    "startTime": "00:52:01",
    "text": "is what's the outlook set that's in the mapping system. So if a particular EID, SE ID, GE ID, entry existed. It could map to a bunch of URlokes and GRlokes. URlokes are just unicast addresses that you would unicast the multicast packet to in G. R. Loaks is a group address that this GEID would map to. Okay. So the second part of the draft app actually says, how do we map from GEID to GRLook. Okay? So, basically, the SR look is encapsulating List Broader, the U R Loke is the outer header destination address in the outer header let's use that in the case when there's non multicast underlay. And GRLoke is the outer destination header address that you use when you have a multicast underlay. And all those addresses appear in data packet. So those are only the fully specified addresses slash 32zer/128. Okay. So how do we map from GEIDs to GR looks? We documented 2 approaches in the draft. 1 hash based on mapping system based. The the hash based 1 basically just takes the GAE ID as input into a shot, 256 function and produces the GR look. And that's assumed that you want control in the XTRs and the underlay provider doesn't care what the group address is because it's decided by the edges. So what the ETR does is it hashes when it gets an IGMP report for GE ID, it hashes that. And into the GR look, and then it joins it on the underlay. Either with PIM or IGP, your favorite multicast underlay protocol or mechanism. And all ETRs will use use the same GR look because they're all using the same hash function. So you want, all the GEIDs to be mapped to the right"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:54:03",
    "text": "underlay address. So it's very simple to do. On the e ITR side, the ITR just does a routing table lookup. And the the GR look is is in there, and it just uses that. So the ITR and the RTRs don't have to do the hash, but they could if they want to, or they could if they want to to validate that the GE ID is actually mapping to a g r look that's in the r look set. Okay. The second mechanism is just use the mapping system. That gives more control to the multicast underlay provider. So what we decided to do very much like the L2 XTRs in the mobility is to use a, a registered distinguished name called something like groupdash 224111. And what that means is for the GE ID 224111, it maps to something that the provider wants to map to, like, 225111. So, basically, what you would do is this the service provider with an SDN controller or out of band management system could register these mappings. The XTRs and ETRs would just use them So the ETR would register SEID 224111, with a g loc of 2251101. And he joins the underlay. 225-111-111 Okay? And the, ITRs and ETRs can use either approach to do mapping system lookups, the outlook set. And that's pretty much it. So I would say that, this draft really complements those 2 drafts. And the 3 of them together, the kind of the trilogy, it really completes all the combinations of multicast that we can do for for overlays. The status of the document, we started it on GitHub back in December 2020, and we didn't publish it till March of 2023. And we called that underlay multicast trees, but we realized there was more functionality, and that's why we changed the Nate to list group mappings"

The first one, let's say the document is adopted by the working on. Are you suggesting that we change these the naming everywhere we use as g groups to to the new notation, to clarify and I mean, it's more uh-uh. Yeah. You mean, in the entire document center or just in 6831? Or, or, yeah, for example, newdrafts.com, like, Oh, should we adopt a new naming convention for future documents? I would say yes because we need to distinguish between them. Because it was very much assumed in 6831 that g and the outer and g and the under were the same value. Oh, okay. And then. And so if we really want to use different and and then I I remember doing back in the day with multicast running, IPv4 multicast over ATM and frame relay and SMDS, those We always had this many to one mapping where do you have all these groups that you wanna map to something on on the underlay. So do you wanna have 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to 1? Now with this terminology and the mapping system, we can do all those things. And the provider. You know, the provider will say, you have 10 groups and they're all going to the same sites. Why do I have to have 10 pieces of state in the underlay? Look at that one. So, And maybe another one be between the two mappings that you've report that's the document, prefer or recommend 1 of the 2. I mean, yeah. Normally when"

It says this master dish, right, and that just just wondering if the document is suggest. Do you wanna do No. The document didn't suggest it. It just said if you wanted edge base versus provider base to use 1 versus the other. Okay. So but but you have a good point because what if, what if one GID hashed and there's an act because it wouldn't it takes a 2 56 bit hash and then takes the lower 32 bits in IP before case. So what if multiple hashed to the same value, and you didn't intend that. Then that's that could be a bug, arguably. Alright. Bye. So maybe we will list in the document pros and cons and and create a slight preference towards the mapping system. And and now not just because it's a preference, but there could be a potential collision situation that happens with the hash base where the collision would never happen the collision won't happen with the mapping system case, but a misconfiguration could cause it to glide choose your poison, I guess. Right? But those are good updates. We can fix the spec for those comments. Thank you. Thanks. I had a similar comment, like, the first market, because we we we are supposed to to revise the multicast documents and move some some of them as a standard truck. I mean, makes sense to have a unified terminology. And in this case, yeah, put it in in the documents we will figure out the details, but I mean, this this kind of of unified terminology will be helpful long. So what I would suggest is if we adopt this terminology from this document, go back to 6331 and use the same"

I don't see the, you know, waving out of setting the question, you know, Yeah. So Well, one thing, I've noticed is that especially when we start having the grouping kind and There's multiple cases actually listed. One of them that's not listed is that the bad actor actually uses a true time stub. And how do we distinguish for that? And what the at least would be because if it uses an indirect time stamp. It's easy to fight it. But if it is not using an invalid stop stance, he's going to be actually constant here. Are you saying time stamp or hash? Yeah. Of reading here the time step to give it the priority, And, timestamp to get the price. Yeah. So, basically, that's what you're is that about after could send an invalid time stamp gonna get a tie breaking Priority when the group address position not because Are you talking about GAAP? Yeah. Oh, Yeah. that I really think that Completely different topic. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Reset major reset. One thing is we're talking about this. We also need to talk about what failures are happening and how those failures are getting So let me rephrase your questions. So comprehensible in my brain. If Gap GAP is going to allocate a address to the applications. That's GEID. Yeah. And Does that have effect on this? Yeah. Yeah. Well, It does because"

So we need to discuss and think about what the implications of those are. Great question. Really good question. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't give you the context. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Stick. Do you have any opinions on this? That's the multicast expert in the room. Yeah, Steve here. Well, I had one thought, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but you could potentially, I don't know, instead of putting the GE ID in in the mapping system, put, like, the application ID That's something So so mapping system would control We switched on the leg group units for that application. But the we get a data packet with 2 IP addresses in it sourced and destination. Yeah. So then we'd have to map that thing to something else that maps to that. Yep. Yep. A person's work. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, anyway. Okay. Well, it's an interesting thing. Problem. Yeah. May maybe we should maybe we should bring this up in the PIM working group when talk about gaps. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Okay.
