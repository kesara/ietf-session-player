So the reason I called this cast getting out deployment is because I'm gonna talk a little bit about cascading a and a little bit and since I didn't know how to write it. It came out as cascading alpha deployment. My name is Ig. I work for Ben, and I have been working for ben for almost ten years now. The point here is that at Alto, we were founded as a deutsche... Telecom spin off. In two thousand thirteen. And we actually at the start where part of the... I think was called P p working group at the F, which then got merged into alto and we actually went along that as you can see two thousand seventeen. Actually already had an outlet implementation that was I wouldn't say complete because Other wasn't complete at that point, still isn't, but but we do have a fully working alpha deployments and we have but there also a customer base that would actually benefit from something that also being in place. And you can already see that I'm using the possibility form here. But let me go into auto deployment. It's"

    "text": "self. So what what we and also do at Ben We run around twenty, I think, twenty to twenty five customer deployments all around the world and medium to large sized networks. We have all the necessary information that the would need to do maps and nine of those, not all of them give us all the information, but nine of those would actually be capable of running alto And why did that just get backwards? The total traffic that we could infect with this So total traffic is around sixty terabytes that we see The traffic that we could effect with Alto is by our best guess between forty and forty five targets. Where we could actually profit from steering traffic how much we would reduce that by. We don't know we have done analysis But usually, at least three quarters of the traffic are. Then the actual traffic that we do steer, So by exchanging information between hyper slash against, you'll see that term here, which This is basically the big traffic shift that we have out there. The traffic that we do steer is around thirty five terabytes and we actually we managed to reduce that down to somewhere around twenty twenty five hours. So we're shaving up a fair bit here of traffic that we can do. And that's the outcome. We don't use Alto. So we actually do do the collaboration and we do what alta is supposed to do we don't use Outlook. We have... We we have two trials running with this. For very, very smart traffic shifters. We have... We've had in the past. We've had numerous files nobody ever used alto. And it. Doing that. That's weird. Okay. Something is seriously running here. I'm gonna use this. And the reason why we're not using why is not being used is because it's a connect problem."

    "text": "So we talked to a lot of networks and they said, yeah. Alta is great. And we would be using it if the C are hyper would use it. And then you talk to the hyper giants and they say, yeah. Like, you know, we have a global customer base. And if not enough people are using out we rather to stick our own our own interfaces is that before developed. It doesn't warrant the effort to actually implement also into our mapping system. So both of them are on the side of the other one shouldn't be first of neither of the moves. If anybody feels reminded the v six, then Yeah. Okay. So what we see instead is we have pretty much every hyper has their own way of communicating or What I would call mapping information and networks are then in the in the position that they have to to collect their information and pushed this out through a lot of different Apis. To actually get that mapping run. Works. As you can see. We are seeing traffic through that. But it's kind of a nuisance. So what... What what what I think alta would really benefit from is something where one of the two parties. So either than that or the hyper would actually draw benefit from it. Without having to rely on the other one of using a to, which is counterintuitive intuitive since is about cooperation and do you make the use case for something that is based on cooperation but then you wanted to cooperate because needs put the clock first. Anyway. That was the deployment part. Now let me go a little into the like, the cascading or I think here here it's called multi domain, but in the end, it's pretty much the same thing. What we do here is we have a core engine which this is a software sector that we started developing ten years ago it's pretty mature by now. This the the picture you have down the bottom is from the ko nineteen"

    "text": "paper that we actually did on this bottom line is we collect Ig we collect each From that we can calculate path as you can see up there. We have the direct point, which is the start for the path, you have then the orange pass through the network and you have the green point which is the exit point of the network. That all is set into code. And as you see down down in the picture, Don't know if you can see the mouse, but on the on the right side of the of the diagram, you see that we have multiple interfaces that go to the Cdn services and user control systems, alto is one of these Unfortunately alto is the one of these that isn't used. At the moment. Other than for testing. But In practice, all of the implementation is there. So we can turn it on. And We can produce maps, we have produced maps. I think we still do So all of the implementation work if that has been done and it has been done for almost half a decade. It's just that we can't really use it. The point here is that for in in order to actually build an or to build any of this mapping information, you need the part. Which means you need to know that red bubble where the path network starts. And that's a very, very heavy operation. So in the end, building building correct or any any mapping information needs to know where the path of the network starts. Problem is that most of the parts, especially when you look at traffic that in the larger networks starts coming from a from a ingress point where you have an intermediate network attached. I mean, of course, you have a lot of p and ice in there as well. They're easy. But the difficult bit is when they're not p penalized. And getting that English part is actually really, really hard. There's this... This is a this is an incredibly hard operation"

    "startTime": "00:14:02",
    "text": "we have a solution for this, which means we actually do the statistics on the incoming traffic, which means we're using data playing to best guess which traffic enters were in the network. And I'll go into this a lot. The only thing that actually want to point out here and this is from A eighteenth paper. That we did on this. What you see here in the bottom right is an ios update. And we tracked actually all of the traffic coming from the ios update. Based on the different handover and the head. I mean, the traffic The neighbor that the traffic came in on for the ios update over time. And as you can see, there is this blue check in there. Which appears only and it really only appears during the update time. This thing was not nice for the peer links for that header it completely ran them over, it just wasted all the space and push pretty much all of the other traffic away. I went for three days, and then it was gone again. Having prior mapping information, capacity information, kind of a communication that this would actually this will happen and I think out would be a good case for this. Would have not gone into that situation. And this is an example we actually see this. When we use to see this more often, hyper john's and have gotten better at this. And the communication has improved, but still I think there's still room to to do more of this. And finally, the second part, this is why I'm going to the cascading pass optimization or the multi domain We've been working on... And this is on submission at the moment. We've been working on multi domain also or at a multi domain a Ceo week we call it internally And The point is here, you have... You have a a continent that has two servers that it can deliver from."

    "startTime": "00:16:00",
    "text": "And by choosing the correct server at the starting As, you can actually truly affect the path throughout the entire network path across As borders. We've been trial running this. With the friendly the Isp that actually runs multiple As in cas form, so we had... We we have had all the information And if you look at the top right, you see this that this eighteen point three eight percent of traffic that actually goes from location one to location two. Which should been mapped by the hyper joined to the other server cluster and would have had a much better path in both of the networks. So this again, and I think this is also a case for for multi domain outdoor where we can actually use this very well. This was... So this this was not deployed. This is a purely theoretical approach that we've done here. So this is only math. But it is based on actual production numbers from one of our clouds. Okay. And With that, I'm coming to the end. So I think on one hand, alto if deployed, especially in a multi domain auto can actually have a benefit just for Isp isps without having to rely on the hyper giants the to to deploy this as well. Just by using a multi domain output, we can spread out deployments throughout the network. And once we have that critical mass or a masks we would be able to then say, hey, we have a Format and we're already using it inside of our eyes we have this in lots of this places. Maybe you wanna maybe someone else wants to hook into a too that Pc led to Bp P p networks that this be some case that I'm not picking of right now. So I think that that path could really help.

So for this kind of interface, saw that you can use Csv. You can use Bg we say there's least private interface between the isps and hyper jets. So what kind of interfaces typically they are using the why out interface will be appear to be difficult to use. Me some comments. Some kind of features work missing or maybe you have a weight or maybe there some features which missing in this in interface. If So Yeah. So first of all, the interfaces are usually derived how the mapping system of the hyper or the Cdn are built. Which means in the end, they're all building a little bit differently and they're all built in different dimensions. One of the things that's and this is a personal opinion right now, This is not the official opinion I've been one of the things that actually a noise is not the right word, but that concerns me is that Bg seems to be used to max things or seems to be used for mapping whereas Bg inherently own has one dimension of having reach ability doesn't actually have that that two dimensional space. I can map this to this, and then you have packs of marking working with communities on Bg routes and you have out of banned Bg sessions to clusters or you do inbound Bg where you announced selective lead to individual classes and then you augment them again with with communities. And all of this, I think is the workaround where I'll since it has the two dimensional space it can can to a lot more."

And what happens is you have a comfort level that's a six and you've have fifty concurrent transmission already, you got your transferring into queue you can get pageant. And if you above it, and you are not. Then that space wasn't really happening. Overall is mostly hard... Right now is mostly hard manual configuration about price levels and so on. And oftentimes really tried will about condition on sort units. Fees. So here, what doing is this called application defined networking. A basic structure is this can layer architecture. So what happens is can have diverse network settings, and then you really have it's the the architecture from. Ip. Is you have a universal minimal deployed deployed a Tc conversion control.

But what do you want is have diverse high level resource models. So what we're doing is taking And and extending into alpha have scheduler and will be able to provide the diverse handle resource models. You. Next slide, please. Okay. So here is a bigger picture and where where it will look like. So we have multi dummy networks. We all the pipes. For example, type I from source destination and go through three networks, And then what happens is you have this controller up. It's also called keys. It's very light contra control plan. And what happens is all system for example, s one is three links, which do want control the resources. So what they do is they essential put resource models into only lower left corner. An example of resource model is our. Can you only have two minutes? Okay. Yeah. I let me try finish this part. And Okay. You have of the model over there and then the rest of the model is specified you the account controller. Know what happens is also is you're gonna have the controller User auto collect visibility, for example, if you transfer from type sort I, then what kind of things will be your utilize you have scheduler to control the level and also time out like Next slide, please. So here's a very quick example and even if this one across you probably get a sense what it does. So here upper the the first level is we resource model, for example, you have single project.

But it is okay. I'm really focused it's that pipeline one I'm using the of one three, four, and for five two using two three five.

So working in ways of securing interaction with Also not only itself, that is also important so how to how the customer access how how to protect for instance the attacks from the client to the alto. So so once we supposed to outside to to all to application let's say, we need to secure the way in which they can interact with Alto and also even the the information for. So that will be as or more, let's say short term. That could be a little bit more midterm that should be rest. Probably something that we can do. Is maybe summarize all of these. Document the wiki. I probably Thank you. taking to in one of the interim meetings of. Thank you. Thank you So you have question? Okay. I think Jody, you can stand up and who on this? Okay."

By some of the leading leaders of some production networks in Europe and the U. S as well as some my. And yeah myself andrew the garage. Next one. Yes. So Rc c seventy nine seventy one which is deployments states that alta is heavily designed for use in multi main environments that's basically because the that we're dealing with are built network networks of networks So currently, whenever you try to exact information from the network you're dealing with multi domain. Now the the standard is the other standard focus on single domain. So this effort looks into the capabilities we need to bring into the standard in order to support think care in nature of multi main networks that we're dealing with. And that... That... Actually, that case, you because got more obvious when you started looking at the edge, which is basically a hit environment made of networks of networks. So next one, Yeah. And just to position the problem, so in multi of the domains, so you start with multiple A. And you have multiple auto service deployed in each. Each one will have a local view or just look view of that A, but will have no knowledge about the other As so for instance, part reconstruction becomes challenging because you don't have knowledge about. The other As is measuring the the cost of a path. Because then also challenging. So this effort looks at that's in this and in this... What you see here on the right side, it's an example of multimedia main network that Richard mentioned, which is, you know, many networks globally interconnected basically science networks in enough and in America, Europe, Asian, Australia,"

Yeah. This is this is coming from the Es net. And it's just another example. In this case, have three domains, and they all have don't trains. So x I here are the bandwidth allocated to certain going to certain destination And as as it goes through the different links, you have different constraints, but these constraints all known three member networks each a. So you don't have a global view and so if you one of the determine was the actual capacity for that path, you to bring the global view of the network. Now this deals with one level one level of bottlenecks x. You go to the next one. This other draft talks about bone structures actually And this is the the name problem. When... And building the the the technical structure of the bottlenecks next So and the point here is that there's partial information and we need to come up with the way that the outer server can this information to to gain global knowledge and deal to provide a global understanding of the network. So Yeah. So this in this view, what if you look at principle instance power patrick instruction in routing information propagate epstein team. What that means is that when when I And a yes, is an server longer term is being que, and it's been given a path source finishing path. It can figure out from the destination, the next hop, and so we can actually tell the downstream path. But it cannot figure out if you provide a source the where it comes from."

So moving on to the next one. Yeah. And so here there are a couple of couple of approaches. One is to provide this information horizontally. So from Aes to, So then each can get can gain global knowledge this information. The other right is information, so you would have And now and I out of server, would be using an outer line querying each and out server of the A to aggregate the information so you move to the next one. We see a highlight level of view these two approaches. One is information from the yesterday yes. One out server to another server. Horizontally, this will allow you to compose that the full path. The other approach is to use now the client we'll with an aggregate or server composing the various the the full path by querying in sequence to the various on out service. Next one? Another challenge been discussing the draft is incremental deployment what happens when one one of the Associates hasn't been integrated with this capability. And so in this case, the idea would be to provide the guidance. For one how to do that how do detect the call had the English point. I when one of the As is does not participate. So when these examples scores that A does not participate. So how this Asp how As reconstruct the the path. The the have upstream path. And, you know, what option you would"

And this is a list of draft that have been written about this topic within alto for quite some time, I guess. And Yeah. Just to bring them together. And then the next one, so next steps we're gonna be having a series of meetings so this will be discussed. Of the interim meetings and then also involving operators into the discussion. I think that's it. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Pricing. From audience? Okay. Let's move. Next one is with Yeah. In in this set of slides we recommend comment about the computing exposure. We have only one minute, or ago No. One. Okay. Good so So... And next, please?

So the bonus entertainment it's essentially the fact that the now operators are deployed multiple centers or is compute nodes. And so I mean, we have different compute capabilities better across network. So the the purpose here will be to for assisting on the identification of the proper data center the public facilities. For what service purpose one could be the installation of functions or, yep. Essentially, that that could be the... You can of cases that we can cover here. So will be at that point to integrate information that could come from the complete infrastructure on I these computer attach to the Network and then expose this information combining information from the network information from the compute as side. As the solution, what we do foresee that there could be they need of as by including these kind of metrics also the metrics has said can we combined with the network matrix with at the current outcomes from Outdoor like, the performance method is related too late bandwidth. They got updates in this current version. We have had it to use cases. One about the instruction for this computing and another one for nice placement of micro service components. Also, jody has joined as scroll of the the draft. And just for the figures that that you can see on your right essentially, that it will be the the kind of integration of we are proposing something basically combining the information political information that we could call it with through P as we commented before. Plus information that could come from compute managers like Google kubernetes this opens start these kind of things. So next, please."

So So in the traditional architecture, We had compute confined to the data centers far away from from humans if you will. The new architecture computer actually spread throughout the path, communication path, basically. Right? Getting closer to humans so we have compute from the data center all the way to the U ui or the final device. And so now the problem becomes one of placing services and selecting services. And the Braun becomes one of finding the right trade. So on the data center, you have a lot of compute power, but high latency closer to the terminal you have lower lower power higher computational power, a lower latency. And so of in that trade off. Arises arises complete ecosystem of problems of finding the right place to deploy your services and once deployed, which ones to select for the specific workload and so you can you can start seeing that importance of how bringing visibility order to be able to optimize this problem. So at the bottom of this diagram then we have the initiation of the application space on the space. May again application service placement. Typically, this will be even by the content provider. Service provider then once it's deployed, you have problems like application service like selection and pass selection typically they driven by the application. Itself. Let me just maybe mention an example that Alright. Very important than that of course, we have a a lot of interesting in being able to to solve and means Ai training. So current currently data centers of running at capacity. As we migrate to it Ai. Whether it's training on inference, there's a need to actually leverage the edge"

And also actually some studies is actually show how you can actually use like fifty x to hundred x actually in terms of energy efficiency in doing so. So very important also, to be able to reduce the energy consumption of these massive workloads. And so And so then moving this to the edge requires figuring out again, how to do the placement in an environment or actually, typically the the the network becomes the also the the bottleneck figuring out that the Cpu the storage, the memory. And event within in the latency altogether. So Of course, other use cases that have been discussed by lee working Group, Ex rd r, all the applications in there enabled by the By the edge cloud as well. So back to you, please. Mh. Okay. This intelligence introduces is the second draft, the one call service dysfunction. Here the point is before we were addressing the partner of the infrastructure, so waiting for infrastructure located and while they they combined metrics the infrastructure itself, here will be related to the service functions. So the different services are typically implemented in in a of services that are be deployed in different points in the network. Usually communicating the service change, let's say. So the year here will be to identify the suitable path before whatever service is changed in such a way that we can the proper service instances that with with the proper metrics. Right? So here again, the the proposal for the solution will be to delivered at auto plus extensions so to us identification of the best chains, so combining any information of Network and service function."

Be we do foresee extensions for a sector unified properties and and also for collecting the information. Is here where there are some other drugs that that. So regarding the figure, you can see similarities with the figure before. So in this case, instead of collecting information from the cloud managers we will be collecting any information from the service function orchestra. So the network functional status. They regarding the dates and and a apologies for the mesh before. So we have added here the some reference to catch framework has additional use case that could motivate even this work because cuts could be benefited for this information that we could provided by Via Alto. And also we added references to different Mechanism for for conveying the information related to the service functions like Galaxy, ninety fifteen and a couple of jobs that and deals with that propagation of functional information in And. Next, please. So some some examples of... But but that's cases of interest. So there will be to things that we could consider will be for twenty satisfaction type or between function instances in a chain or yahoo essentially to identify what could be the between the different components in the chain, not only from the customer perspective but also on the different micro services in order to identify what could be there.

So that that will be my answer not not sure I got probably the question. Not please let me know. Richard? I I think this is very interesting. Can you go back to one slide when you talk about the potential information? Exposure. Yeah. Over here. This is very interesting. Because one feature in Arp is introduce concept called Pid basically is attraction of a set of note. From here, are you talk about potentially even making a P have checked into some kind like abstract service Id. For kubernetes And therefore, we will define an abstract boost for example, then membership of the Pid can become dynamic. And then the property to this begun... So essential Pid becomes a service. Instant service name. The the benefit of using this abstract thing of course, compared with the be dns answer would be only query well there's no interface in the s and here are does have a pushing where it can push the all modifications to that. Would that be something you you are thinking in terms of difference? Me. I don't get it. Yep. Here we need to explore more we could define these kind of P So you look at the the tabs information all service functions for, the mentioned before. Identifier.

The identifier of the satisfaction. But this is yep. It's something to that requires for the for the development for the for work... Further work. So Okay. Because the reason I'm thinking about this one is typically for example is what you do is you using some kind of a pop up system. Right, for example, I see the over here. Which is a key store and main main function is less and working. Sort of for you list all instances and started watching then our modification be pushed included client, for example, on the ko leads on the device. So of then you will have a interface, which because a reason asking is because seeing how how important really is for the transport the this. I I I can talk you more offline. Great. Okay. Thank you.
