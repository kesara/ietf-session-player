It's 5 PM local time. I hope everybody around the world is more or less happy with that and can present in full state of mind. Having said that, I'm Hank And Exactly. And, we'll be your co chairs today. So there's a note well that, some of you note well, the is about content. So whenever you say something, you will be recorded in room, there are cameras, if you would like to do not like to be on the camera, please, stay out of their point of you and also do not speak up, that is basically the only way not to be recorded here. There will also be, IP, implication when you say something that a lot of BC piece here. You can click add. There's also the note very well that is not on the slide deck. Which is about, conduct, another content So, whenever you fear that something is not going well in the in the, human to human perspective, behavior, like treat others like you want to be treated yourself and such, you can approach the chairs, the ADs or the other papers like the ombudsman. So please do not hesitate to point something out that is not visible to us because we want to to improve, always on the atmosphere and the and the community here. There's a meet echo. It is very important that everybody in the room either scans this QR code August to the, agenda site and clicks on the camera icon. Which is the full meet echo client.

On my side, sometimes it's a little bit flaky, so I will find an issue. If you find something that is wrong with this systems that the the IT services we provide here. Please follow that link and find an issue yourself that really also helps us there's also a, procedure point here, and this is called notetaker.

If this is too far away, there's a meeting material available on the data tracker. So you have it on your own swing. There's agenda for today. So, basically, the five minutes I've already taken up And, yeah, basically, before I'm reading out an agenda aloud, I'd say we have a small agenda bash, Which is the second item. Right? Yeah. So the comparison of co op security protocols are both Francesca and John are not available for the this time slot, unfortunately. So this will be gone, we will mic have, open mic at the end or Yeah.

So, we've got a few changes, but the the bulk of it really is just that I've added in the Etsy cyber security for consumer internet of things baseline requirements. This is added, a fair number of new requirements to the mapping. There was a surprising result. Haven't covered all of them yet. Maybe we've got them now. I'm not sure.

We have 3 separate sets of baseline requirements, they all call themselves baseline requirements. Amazingly, I'm I'm I am very curious to know what they left out there's a lot in there. The question to the working group, honestly, from this point, is what's left to we have 3 different mappings, which together are pretty thorough. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some wording changes and some editorial cleanup needed. But in terms of overall content, Are we done yet? And if not, what's left? Next slide, please. On Right.

So since, you may have not followed that work, to begin with, I thought that I should give a very brief summary on what it is. There was a document developed in the Utah working group focused on profiles for TLS and d t DPLS 1.2 which sort of like, had the intention to describe what type of credential types and what type of, extension, what type of optimizations you should be using when using TLS and DTS. In a constrained IOD environment based on like, what we have seen in other specifications, was done in in stacks, in protocol stacks, and also what, other organizations have been doing. And that work was published 5, so a little while ago already. And they are, luckily, lots of deployments, available of TLS and DTS in those environments, following that guidance. And then, of course, as time progressed and, the TLS working group worked on the version 1 or 3 of the of the protocol. We started to update that guidance and, it's shorter than the previous version because there are obviously fewer extensions available. Many things happen addressed already in the core specification. So that's a great thing. And now with, detail is 1.3 also being published it's it was in"

So it's not completely out of context, but you follow-up on on on that prior work. Okay. Next site. Recently, we've got an extensive review from Michael, and we've started to address some of it, probably halfway there. Had a lot of changes in the documents, specific related to the X Five Four Nine certificate profile which was also part of the original recommendation, but was a much shorter section because obviously when you are using X Five Four Nine certificates, as one of the credential types typically in a with mutual authentication, you have to deal with the questions about what how do you populate the fields in the CA certificate in the subordinate, certificate, CA certificates and also in the end entity certificates for the device the server side is is addressed already in other documents that were published earlier with And by doing that update, obviously, we had, ran out of time a little bit and the others are tracked in this issue tracker over here, which is, in the repository GitHub repository. Okay. Next slide. I won't go through all the issues, but, instead I would I want to focus on the certificate profile topic, I'm I'm going talking talk about the the TLS specific extensions So what the certificate profile did in the past and it's still doing is it focuses on certificates based on elliptic Curve cryptography. Which is sort of the recommended approach for IOT devices due to their size."

This IDFIDs and LDFID, terminology. The guidance in their focus is currently on LDAP IDs on these locally significant, device identifiers rather than the manufacturer provisioned ones because those are actually as we will hear later in the in the session when chuff is going to talk about FTO. They are already guidelines available on how to populate, certificates and and different specifications like anima Priscay and and Yeah. A couple of other organizations have worked on these onboarding protocols or they provide guidance for those IDF IDs. Okay. Thank you. So one So I pick it a few items of those. So if you look through the the latest version of the document, a longer, description. I picked a few where there is, So where we would appreciate a little bit of feedback where we where we rely a little bit on more than what we saw but also maybe you have been deploying some of those IoT devices or or your company did So if you, just as a, out of curiosity, so just to check, Who in the room has actually been using X5 for 9 certificates on their IoT deployments, So you see, bunch of hands. That's excellent. Yep. Elliot, of course. Just a quick comment. It's required in matter. It's it's it's it's actually required in matter"

Who who in panic jumped up to the But, yeah, I just wanted to check, like, what is the audience I'm talking to here? And so so a good number of people actually do that already. So you made me you're going to be target of, questions that I have later ended it. So one of the things, one important aspect is the validity of the certificates. And so neatless to say, is that IoT devices often have no reliable time source. So which makes the a validation of the certificate difficult, And so what, manufacturers have been doing the past and and still do is they use these special value in certificates to indicate that they have no expiry done. And they do that for end entity certificate to avoid the case that the device sits in the shell floor for an extended period of time and then get shipped and then Nothing works. And so That's that's kinda cool, in some sense. However, it also has the implication that you have to do the same for the rest of the chain as well, which then creates the question about how the heck are you doing a revocation? And since we are not mandating, OCSP, Nausea, Ellis, nobody's because nobody's using them. The text talks about kind of in in soft language there that the certificate management protocols that are being used on those devices, typically in context of a device management protocol, are kind of the way to update those certificates and to deal with, quote, revocation so you can update trust anchors and then you also can provision new certificates to the device, for example, these, LDFIDs."

That it's it's not ideal, But Yep. It is what it is. So Christina. You do one question straight away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. Coming. Just fitting the pattern, Kirstenhams is on the time source topping, there's also a document that I have in to TRG, on rate time, basically, about what devices can do to help here. Let's talk a lot more about that. Yeah. The rough time. Nope. Not real time. It's a complete it's different thing. Oh, okay. Completely offline situations. Oh, that's sounds sounds interesting. Yeah. Maybe there's something we can, suggest for the future. Maybe there's some some good idea at the rough time, work is also, new, kind of Elliott. Yeah. So on OC on OCSP, Does it make sense to have a little bit of a discussion about the direction of authentication and who be doing OCSP stapling or or can that ameliorate some of the situation. Yeah. That's this, yeah, that's actually a very good point. So in with OCSP stapling, the idea was that the device actually does the stapling and then sends these, Oh, I no. It's actually not Is that true? No. Actually, it's the other way around the server. And The server sends a stapled, the issue there is that many of these constraint devices don't have a lot communication partners to begin with. And when you do the stapling, if it's unsuccessful, typically, you talk to your device management server. And if you'd if you do that and it's, it turns out that the certificates that you get are revoked or have other issues, then what are you what you're supposed to do."

And that's a question that, was discussed in the context of eat, TLS 1.3 as well, which was, in my opinion, a little bit of controversial discussion, and and I don't in many of this, that that embedded its tax don't even support OCSB stapling to begin with, which sort of makes me believe that it's not so widely used Eda. Let me follow-up here. Woman. What what I'm thinking actually is this is something that It may require a little bit more development thought. But but the the the recommendations are a little bit on the sweeping side in this case. And try and maybe that case that we need some bits in terms of when to use and when not to use what this, you know, to try and and give some guidance on the circumstances around that. Yep. Yeah. I just don't have the I don't have the story worked out on when you would be using it. So a good example, right, is for e in the in the EPLS discussion. Right? Yep. If if you're doing OCS a CSP stapling, and you don't even have IP connectivity. Right? What do you do? Right? That's that's a big issue. It's it's like Yeah. It's it's beyond that, right, as you're getting into more application level, aspects and pay the then it becomes very circumstance specific. May yeah. Maybe Mhmm. Right. Certainly.

It's even possible to for the subordinate CAs to just re sign the end entity certificates. But not so a little bit weirder where you get this expired certificate, and then you go get something that has the same public key, and it's the same. But it's conceivable that we could do that. Is Right. Sorry? The Yeah. And the LDV ID side of things, which is the operational private PKI of the enter of the Organization. In EST at least, We have the ability to actually do that, and we even referenced like there's age old thing where you have old root CA signs new one and new one signs old one. If anyone actually has code that does that. I have no idea, but We have that mechanism out there, and we have an EST that ability to go and get a new certificate at the halfway point And we even put that into EST over coapp, and we said how to do it efficiently, so you didn't have to have too many things. So I think that a lot of that stuff is possible. And we could so we could have rather than infinite lifetimes on LDV IDs. We could have short ish lifetimes, Right? However, if you, you know, there's a lot of clickbaity webinars out there.

Or Elliott said, what do you do if you don't get a staple because it turns out that you know, you're an elevator and you've been revoked. What what do you do? Right? Stop operation. Do you Flash a light. Does someone come and maintain you? I think it totally depends on the context. And I don't think we're gonna ever have good advice here, except that I think that we we could document the tussle. Right? Let's say this is an unresolved issue a the bee. I just wanted to say that the other part was that, I had some conversations with some of the authors of 802.1 AR. Because it's very weak on a lot of things, about what goes into the certificate. It's very so we wind up. So the question is we could do up, IOT, an IOT profile in the the IETF of 8021ar. Where we actually nailed down some of these things. In particular, serial numbers the the the not the certificate serial numbers, the the u product serial numbers. Okay. And where they go and what goes on, and there's a wide variety across the industry right now of how this works, and it would we could easily get some standard.

And so you may run into into problems that you sort of self inflicted by issuing, certificates, which have too short of a life life time. But, probably we should distinguish between devices that are really strength in in as we talk about them in in a number of the groups versus devices which are IOT devices, but more like the classical embedded Linux where you have, NTP in some form and and and everything is is cool where you still have some maybe some networks where the bandwidth is, an issue, etcetera. Think maybe that, probably reflects what covers the comment that you had earlier to distinguish the different cases. Yeah. On on the other, on the 1 AR specification type of thing, I'm not sure I I have the appetite to to do that, to be honest. But but but as I will have later in my slide deck, if if it works out time wise. We can help you with that.

No. I was asked to elaborate on a comment that put in into the, into the chat window. Like with the elevator example, a lot of, a lot of IOT devices aren't internet connected.

So as part of a trusted firmware download, management of the management of try what I've seen in IoT devices is actually management to trusted roots. Those trust agreements are related to firmware validation, but, there there's no reason they can't be used that same mechanism cannot be used for, for, general cert management and whether they be, root certs or intermediate certs. So it's not as good as an OCSP stapling because it's OCSP when you get timely information, but with an IoT device, you can't actually compel an IOT device, for instance, to not operate or or unless a 4 unless, firmware upgrade takes place on a on a periodic basis. Like the elevator example may force a firmware upgrade for, you know, on a Saturday, every week 1 weekend every month. So, I think that there are alternatives and there need to be alternatives for devices that aren't our IP connected. That was that was basically what I was, what I was commenting on in the chat window. Thanks, Gary. That's a that's a that's a good comment. Yeah. We should will update it the the document to to cover that too. And if some sense, it reflects specifically when it comes to the trust and courtesy. It reflects, what the practice study is also done in the in the browser word where you have the the trust anchors part of the the whole software bundle. In this case, the software panel is is often sort of like the firmware plus then or the bootloader and then some application firmware on top of it So it definitely I think it sounds a little bit weird.

The other hand, if you update, a device to, for example, to use a switch from like, you change the some cryptographic protocol at the application layer instead of you just to sign in. You use a cam suddenly. Then that needs to be reflected in in the key usage as well. So this is something where you can trick yourself a little bit if you're not careful. If you don't put the right key usage in there, you may end up, sort of later, and down the road, prevent certain usages of the key, which you initially didn't the mission. We still, put a recommendation forward, which is kind of, aligned with what we had previously in the document, but also covering some of the one use cases and and which I summarized here and in in essence, for the for the root cert, we have, the the key usage is is, may not be set. There's a shoot on the the key usage and and the must not on the extended key usage for the subordinate, certificate we indicate our key usage for for, signature and and cert signing has to be used But then for the end entity, I think that's where it makes, most sense to put some restrictions in place particularly if if you have multiple different certificates for different purposes.

And so far, we don't have anybody that I know of, who has said You must put a DNS ID of ABC and someone else has said you must have a DNS name of not ABC. And so, of course, you can't build an IDev ID with both of them. Right? At this point, it looks like you could build an ID that could satisfy all of the available enrollment protocols, and you could be maximally inclusive. But we could easily trip that way if someone started doing things. So I it would be nice actually if we wound up as the collection of"

Are products in Backnet, the building automation protocol. Whatever. Uh-huh. So every certificate has the back net colon slash slash 1, 2, 3, 4. And that's it. That's the device ID. That's found dynamically using a variety of mechanisms to bind. And then once you find him, then you confirm. Am I really talking to you? So we we we started with Goids. We started with all kinds of fancy stuff. And we said, everything has this numeric ID that somebody went to great pains to make unique. It's a 22 bit thing. Yeah. Just use that. So it seems very simple, but our certificate simply says your eye in the sand And do you, sir? 334. Okay. Would you use the sand? That is the ID because we don't have DNS names. If they're That's okay. Right. You know, it's okay. 1000 of them on the wall. Nobody wants to give them DNS names. And they find each other using this polling protocol.

So So in this, we're kind of We're gonna talk a little bit about the problem we're gonna solve or we're we would like to solve. But but It's important to note that the 3 of us, we kind of represent the network and the application side. So, Rohit and myself, the network can trade in the up citation science. Can I use it? I can also trust. Okay. That it's an honor. So what's the problem statement? So we're seeing an acute problem in IoT deployments in, enterprise environments. That problem is, a problem of silifications. So so what we see is that got the 19 network deployed. It typically supports these days, Wi Fi, but also 80254andbletype protocols. So we've got a multi radio environment installed. And but what we're seeing is that application, providers that have a device ecosystem that kind of want to deploy into these environments, they end up kind of bringing their own infrastructure. So we have these applications coming with their own infrastructure, coming with their device ecosystem, and another application provider comes in you know, same thing. So we're we're seeing all these parallel infrastructures deployed.

Either Now most of the kind of devices on kind of the bottom side of this picture here. They support a specific radio technology and be it wife be it Billy, be it Zigbee, So that's kind of clearly defined But what's not clearly defined is how an application can actually talk to these devices over a kind of generic IoT infrastructure. So so what we took on was basically trying to standardize kind of the northbound piece of this. So, basically, between application and network and basically look at 3 areas. First of all, how do we kind of onboard these devices. So how can how can a network basically tell oh, sorry. How can an application basically tell a network that, hey. A device is coming and, it's gonna come up on your network and here's how you bring it on. The second thing is then and that's very that's important for IP based devices, non IP based devices. The second problem here is very much in the kind of non IP gateway realm. And the kind of that's the problem. Disdrafts, Nipsey, discusses is how do you talk to or how do you create a generic interface to devices that don't speak IP. And and two areas there is control is is all around kind of how do you establish that by directional communication. How do you connect and exchange data?"

So so we're looking to kind of create a standard around the application to network interface. For for this. And you can go to the next slide. Thank you. So the approach we took is, we we we wanted something that would work for multiple radio technologies, So the radio technologies we typically see in these enterprise environments are you know, obviously, wifi, but also Zigbee Bluetooth and and thread, but we we didn't want, you know, the standard to stop there. We wanted it to be more tensible, potentially add things like Lorawan And Ocean and so forth, but we focused mostly on these technologies because those are the ones that we've typically, deploying, deploying so the approach was to to come up with an interface that is I would say, independent of those radio technologies, but extensible to these and other new radio technologies. So we end up with kind of a, a logical gateway that is serving potentially multiple, controllers that, are specific to radio technologies. So the first problem around provisioning, We solved through SCIM. So an IETF standard which you probably already know. So system for cost domain identity management and we proposed a a new base chema a a new device based schema there that is extensible with, with radio extensions. So you'll kind of define a scheme device. And then you will have if depending on the, the the protocols that it supports"

So so with Kim, you can, provide a device identity plus any extensions that include the methodology that that or the app, the the protocol that device support to to bring the device onto a a network. So you will send the scheme object to the gateway. The gateway will return a scheme ID and then you can use that identifier going forward to perform Nipsey operations, on that device. So and that's kind of the the stand that will or the the draft that we're, presenting here. What does Nipsey do? It's basically a restful interface it's also extensible and hierarchical. So it it'll base it basically describes a number of basic APIs. That are, again, extensible with attributes that are, a protocol specific. So so the API is kind of uplevel the communication to, a device. So there's a connectivity API that allows you to make connections with devices. There's a data API that allows you to exchange data, so basically read and write. And then there's the registration API that allows you to register things such as pump some topics, for example, and those pops up topics you can then consume over a telemetry API, which is MQTT based. Those topics could be broadcast from devices. They could be connected modes just streaming data or you know, any events pertaining to devices such as connection state. Next slide, please.

I don't know if we've done thread yet, but I'm we haven't done thread yet. So we we've done VLiziki and and Wi Fi. There's applications extensions as well, which is important. Obviously, obviously, the gateway will have some role we'll have role based access control here. So to determine which applications can work with which with which, devices but you know, an application that onboard the device can obviously add their own access control on top of that you know, to determine which applications can control devices or which applications can receive data. There's potential security extensions as well. And then on on those devices, we can have We can run connection APIs. Connection API is being Okay. Potentially binding if binding is required. Or connection if a connection is required. So, for example, you know, at as as Zigbee will do a join, so a binding, but you don't have to do a connection to a device a a BLE device you may or may not bind, but you will definitely connect And then, the data API basically allows you to exchange data with attributes.

But we have made the queue. For QM to the end. Okay. Alright. Then we can go to the exhibits. Okay. So a few small examples. You know, what if you want to, listen to a daily advertisement. So obviously, you'll, onboard the device first. If you wanna listen to an advertisement of a of a device, You'll do that through onboarding, requests. You'll send the skill object to the, to the network to a gateway function, you'll get a response with a device ID And then you can do operation or Nipsey operations on that, device ID. So you'll do a post and you register a topic so the topic will be, you know, advertisement for this device. You know, you give it a name. You'll get a response for that. And then you will, basically be able to subscribe subscribe to that topic. Then as soon as the device starts, advertisement or or start broadcasting, basically, that broadcast will be published on that topic. And, obviously, you will receive the the content of that advertisement. Now what you will receive. So so this is definitely kind of plumbing. Right?

The access point will basically connect that device. Now really has something specific is that when you wanna talk to, that when you wanna kind of talk to an attribute on a beauty device, you have to kind of get a connection handle. So what you have to read the database of the device so that that happens between the access point and the BLE device. And this is called service discovery. Once you've done service discovery, the connection, the response get said send back with a list of services that the device, supports. Then then then then you'll pick you you'll pick 1. Right? You'll pick an attribute. And then you'll, if you wanna read it, you'll do a get, right, that translates into a b read PLU read, do a response.

So do read in the right as, like we do in the Biri device, Here, we don't have to connect because the Zigbee device is on the mesh. So there's no connection for for Zigbee. So so it is there's 2 things as an from an application perspective. You you You we we kind of make the gen the applications, available genetically. But, you do have to know know, which radio technology you talk to if you do a connect on a Zigbee device, then you're gonna get a failure because you know, you don't have to connect a ZB device.

What is the encoding of that value Is it a Zigbee encoding? It's, it's hex. It's, But it's it's it's whatever the Zigbee spec says for that attribute. Okay. So the application has to know it's speaking to ZigBee thing, there. So in effect, I mean, ZigBee men's over, and and you haven't you haven't clarified it with Zigbee or Zigbee IP.

So, alright. I mean, somebody should carefully look at the charter and see if maybe we can fit it in here. I don't know. I think it would be good if somebody does the work. I don't know where, but, like, it seems and then see if we can, like, squiggle it and Hopefully, nobody else's listening. Yeah, Harnes. It's being recorded for. Yeah. Be enough. This idea is obviously not new. As as you can imagine, like, came up with that idea of tunneling, sort of end to end. Having said that, one of the challenge this work we'll be facing is that the companies who sell, deploy these controllers, these middle boxes gateways. They didn't do that as an accident. I'm they did this as a control point to make their products sticky. If you figure out how to get that away, that would be fantastic for the consumers, But, it's going to be rough. Not, the the second thing is and it's a it's a business question. It's like not something you can solve anyway as engineer the other thing is may want to look at some other work and a different design of exactly this stuff that, OM8 published as a they call it the gateway specification which, This gentleman over there was one of the contributors to that to that work. And it may give you some ideas on how other paper solved that also using a rest API and also dealing with, devices. It's just a different, data point, and there are numerous other examples on on similar items."

I mean, I mean, Clearly, I mean, most of the, the the people that are deploying the infrastructure piece, the the controller pieces, are are I mean, they're not in the business of doing that. Their business is the application. So and our customers are really looking at interest real infrastructure vendors to go after this. I think there's definitely a need there. Okay. Okay. Right. Thank you. And, Jeff, we can see you. Can we hear you? Okay. Hello? Can you hear me? Also with okay. I know. Okay. So I'll talk twice as fast since we've got a little bit less time. So first of all, I'd like to, I'm Jeff Cooper, and I'm from Intel Corporation. I'm also the co chair of the Fido Alliance IoT Technical Working Group. My other co chair is is here online, Gary Mangam. And I'd like to also, call out to Hans who's a who's a a signatory to the fido of, the FTO spec. So you'll see his name in there. And and and one of the things we wanted to do was to have a FEO spec reflect a a wide spectrum of the industry and and Hannah certainly helped us do that. Let's go to the next slide. So just to explain where we are, FTO is spido device onboard. It's an onboarding protocol. I'll go and describe it in a minute. We've had some larger adoption of it. The Dell Edge Group has adopted it for a number of platforms. And that's part of their, native edge."

There are some other stuff like servers and customers, stuff but we know that it's all really about the onboarding. IBM has a project, with their open horizon project their open horizon site, working with a German government I think it's called agroregio. Exxon has been talking about the work that they've been doing in their labs. There's, you know, presumably follow on to that that's coming, but At the moment, they've been doing a lot of really interesting work in figuring out how FEO can make your, onboarding of your, your procedures for intake of IoT devices and getting them up on the network to go faster. Meanwhile, we have some independent implementations that have come out Intel's implementation is distributed through elabedge. That's written. The server components are in Java. The device component is in c. Obviously, there's an X Eighty Six focus, but it has actually run on other processors for example, arm VIN CSS is a company from Vietnam that has, started with the intel code, but actually has moved it over to Go and, and has their own work on it. And, and they're running on microprocessor So we have it now. The spectrum from microprocessors up to server type products. And Red Hat has an implementation in Rust. We've been running with the same specification for a while now, FTO 1.1. That's as specification. We held it steady so that the implementers would have a good implementation target. So what we've been doing instead is we've been answering questions by writing app notes there are 7 of them out there. One of them has quite been posted yet, but thing that we've done is we've done the, a spec for how to put FTO credentials on the TPM. Don't have to be on a TPM, but if you do have a TPM, it would help if everybody did it the same way."

    "text": "And then, we've started certification within the Fido Alliance. And there's actually a a conformance testing going on as we speak. There are a number of companies that are the using the internet to go and interconnect their implementations and and seeing what happens and who read what into the spec and that kind of thing. I'm sure you've all seen that. For. And certification will follow. At the moment, it's lower security levels, it's really basically you, you explain what you've been doing and then you get security advice on it. Next slide. This is gonna be a nutshell of of how it works. I'll go quick. In the factory there, the device is, mated cryptographically to a set of credentials. Some credentials go in the device. Some of the credentials go in an object called an ownership voucher. Now there is, there is such a thing as a voucher in, in IETF, rfc8 with 8366. Our ownership voucher is different. So you'll have to look in the FTO spec if you wanna get all the details, but it is it actually evolved independently, and it's a separate, separate object with a similar similar kind of purpose. The ownership voucher goes to the target cloud, and it'll go through the supply chain. And that would follow, say, the the order act path, the paperwork path for a device. And the device goes directly to where it's gonna be installed. So when the ownership voucher arrives the target cloud. There's gonna be this issue of how does the device find the target cloud that has the ownership voucher. The way that works is there's a static address in the device, which identifies 1 or more rendezvous services that these are simple servers. They do something very simple, similar to DNS, but at an application level,"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "01:24:00",
    "text": "the target cloud registers, the ownership voucher with the rendezvous service, when the device wakes up, It goes to the rendezvous service, and it finds the the owner that claims to own it. And then All of the, the work is done in step 5. Where the owner authenticates the device authenticates using a device certificate. The owner authenticates using ownership voucher. And then there's, you know, the usual key exchange and crypto tunnel And, then there's a a sub protocols that are used to actually onboard the device. And step 6, the idea is that the device should now be in operation. So what's showing temperature data flowing up to the cloud. That, that's really just a, to show you that that after you're done, you shouldn't have to touch the device again. Okay. So let's go on to the next slide. And I think there's a copy of this slide, in the deck. So you might have to do 2 advances, Here we go. So there are some IETF protocols that people might be familiar with their good protocols. They're out there. It's this one is a little bit different in some ways and a little bit the same. So, of course, we use IETF objects we send our data over TLS, oh, sorry, over t We can also use TLS. We don't actually rely on TLS less. We'll get to that. We use seaborne, coze, and eat. So, so we're using these signing structures and, and these, IoT encoding mechanisms. The discovery of a server, the, we use this rendezvous mechanism. So one of the things we were concerned about is that we wanted to avoid requiring that people change the network So you guys all work on the networking parts of the, of the organization. Right? And and and that's IETF, but in the, in a more of an application world, if somebody's out there and saying, hey. Can you stand up IoT devices?"

    "startTime": "01:26:02",
    "text": "Getting changes to the network seems to be the long pole for him So we said, no. We didn't wanna do that. You but you can put up as many application servers as you want. Quickly as you want. So so we ended up doing it that way. So that's where the rendezvous protocol comes from, and that's 2 of the protocols of the 3 the call. So we have an FTL. We do pass data through the supply chain, and we have this ownership voucher. It's one voucher per device just like in the IETF vouchers but the ownership voucher actually routes through the supply chain. And so if you wanna if you want to be manufacturing to stock, you can have ownership vouchers that are sitting at a distributor and nobody has bought those devices yet. And they can be routed incrementally either to other distributors or to end users. By signing the ownership vouchers and endorsing them over. Incrementally. So that's actually a, a major flexibility piece in the ownership voucher that we have. Then we do mutual authentication, with device certificate, but then we use the ownership voucher to authenticate the the owner side of it, the, like, the the cloud that's onboarding the device. The encryption very similar to TLS, but we implemented the crypto inside of FTO, not in TLS, perhaps if we had the, the lighter weight TLS spec that Honda was talking about earlier today, we would have gone more for TLS, but we didn't have it at time. For onboarding, we actually have a set of sub protocol I think that's really an important piece. So we actually have a whole repo where you can actually do contributes and and and submit new protocols. For, for running the actual onboarding piece of FTL. And then, Yes. It can run over non IETF protocols, and there's been a little bit about it. But in it runs over TCP most of the time. And, Gary, for example, has done some work, with his company in, in, in non IP protocols. And there are some other people who have taken a look Let's go to the next slide."

    "text": "We have this specification for FDO in TPM this is saying, how do you put the credentials for FTO into a TPM? Obviously, this implies that you have a TPM, and you don't have to have a TPM to run FTO. So the idea is, well, if people are using TPM and a lot of the the kinds of platforms that are currently doing FTO have TPMs it would be really nice if they did it the same way. Why would that be important? Well, one of the ideas is that a TPM manufacturer could actually put the t the FTO credentials in the TPM when it ships the part, And so if you wanted to convert a device to support FTO, you could actually change the TPM part that you put onto the device, and it would now automatically or an FTO. The idea of being able to discover whether you have credentials. So if you were saying, you know, Linux startup script and you're saying Do I have FDO credentials and do they tell me to run FDO? It'd be really nice if you could have a standard way of doing that. So we we provide that. And, obviously, we have credentials so you can run FTO based on this thing. And then have to be able to update the credentials so you can run FTO again. One of the consequences of running the transfer ownership to protocol within FDL is you get a new set of credentials that nobody ever has. There's a new ownership voucher. And continue to run. You can run FTO again. So we have to support that capability And, and then we wanna be able to, to restrict access to the credentials unless your ready to run FTO So the basic idea is that when the system comes up, the TPM is open and allows you to to see those registers and to, to look at the credentials. And then the idea is that there's some software early in the boot process. That examines the credentials, performs FTO if it's needed to be run and otherwise, locks the credentials and the TPM until the next boot. And, Let's see. Let's go on."

    "text": "To the next slide. And let's see, they there there are several registers within the TPM that are allocated the the they're, that, that, that they're allocated differently pending on bay basically the way the TPM protections have to work. So there's one set of registers that's used for keys and secrets. There's another set of registers only for the active flight because you have to be able to tell whether FTO is supposed to run. And then all the other FTO parameters are put another one. And then there's actually a register allocated so that if you have TPM if you have FTO credentials in a TPM chip, the Bender can put the ownership voucher in the device. And this is something you would only do at the very beginning of life of a device. Then once you, then you would take the ownership voucher out, delete it from the TPM, and it would run independently just like, other kinds of vouchers. And so we're actually, interested in having reviewers of this. If anybody's and in taking a look at it, it's actually posted on the Bido Alliance website, and, please please go ahead and read it and review it us, and we're very interested to see what you think of it And let's see your next slide. That's it. Okay. Any questions? Very quickly. We are because we are over official time. Oh, Michael here. So, two things. Does it have to be a TPM, or can it be a secure element? Well, the spec is based on this TPM spec. My guess is that depending on the secure elements, you could be doing other things. FTO does not require a TPM. You can use secure element with FTO.

Standardize how specifically initial credentials are stored into secure elements anti PMs, and some of the higher level processes around the factories that do that. So really love to have FTO common kind of be involved in that, because it would be nice to have some more variety in the in the opinions. Okay. There. Okay. So Thanks. And I'll order your documents. Thank you. Great to see you, Chip. Can you send a mail to the list of the the pointer to the to the document you want to review on? Happy to do the review. Yes. Actually, it's gonna be posted on the Fido Alliance website, but there's a little bit of a delay. It was approved a couple of weeks ago. So it will actually appear in the standard place, the same place where the FTO spec is. Oh, cool. Okay. Perfect. Yep. Thanks thanks for the work. Mhmm. Alright. Yeah. And thanks for the presentation. We are 3 minutes over. Thank you for the patience. Thank you for all the contributions and the lively discussions. Thank you, Jeff. For remote attendance and, see you all at, 119 and Brisbane, I think. Thanks, guys. Actually, and I left my battery charging for work. Alright. Well, actually, this is still a year."
