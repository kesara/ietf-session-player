I got COVID, and so I switched my registration to remote. You're welcome Well, hopefully you're feeling okay I am feeling fine today. I got other family members that are still down with it, but feeling much better All right. Thank you I'm dave thaler. This is joint work with Hink and Tom Vasadi talking about draft O2 Next slide. All right, so just some history here at 118, we first adopt this as a working group document, and so that's when it was posted as draft zero zero as a working group document formerly individual submission uh in june of this year we posted draft o one which uh the main item needed a bunch of work was the section formally called endorsing identity That one had a bunch of discussion work by Lawrence, Thomas, and Hank, and with tech suggestions and I got a slide on this later on And also after that, after O1 was posted, then Ned did a review and filed five issues Thanks much to Ted. That was great And so in July, we posted 03 that addressed a lot but not all of Ned's feedback, and we'll talk about those today And our goal is to get ready for working group last call So next slide, please All right, so I'm going to walk through the five issues uh the first one um you can see the number at the top is the GitHub Issue Tracker number and the title after that is the subject of the issue that Ned filed All right, so basically the first one, Ned had a comment that it wasn't clear in a diagram that there was two"

    "text": "places that said hardware claim set, and it was clear that those were different sets of claims, right? That it wasn't just the same one in two places. And so the first thing we did was we noticed that a claim set was to words in 93384, which is the right architecture. By the way, the approved each spec that's in the RFC editor Q uses claims with an S space set whereas 9334 use claim without the S, set. And so this one was arbitrary different with no space, and so we at least made it match the RFC but we had to pick one of those two and we picked to match the RFC rather than the one that's not yet an RFC in the hopes that maybe all three will change by the time of RFCs And so in the, to address the comment, the touch that's in bold is one of two things it was changed just makes it clear it says one set of claims, claim set one, and an additional set of claims claims claims touch that's in bold is one of two things that was changed. Just makes it clear, it says one set of claims, claim set one, and an additional set of claims, claim set two, to go along with the figure that next, was talking about. Next slide, please In the figure, it had, this is the one that was confusing and so we added the one and the two there to go along that text It says these are two different sets of claims on the left and on the right And so that text explains that both of those are different plane sets about the same uh target environment so uh on the left and on the right. And so that text explains that both of those are different claims sets about the same target environment. So that was the resolution to that part, which was a confusing and hopefully this clarifies things. And so I'm going to keep going in the interest of time unless there's questions or I see somebody at the mics So next slide Next one is about the comparison rules. And so Net Observe that the reference value provider that's RP reference value provider has insight on how best a verifier should apply matching rules, right? So along with your reference value, can come things like these are intended for exact matching or by the way, here's a range or whatever, and that comes from the reference value provider. And so we observe that that was true for the reference value provider, but the same thing could be true from say an endorser or even in a tester, and so we made it be more general"

    "startTime": "00:08:03",
    "text": "here to say, so the text, it's the parent, there is brand new with the bold as the main points and some implementations hints or suggestions for how to do a comparison might be supplied by a reference value provider as part of reference values and endorser and or and a tester but the verifier owner is authoritative for appraisal policy for evidence and their relying party owner is authoritative for appraisal policy for attestation results as depicted in Section 3 of 9334. So 9334 already said that but of course this is going down into a level more detail and so our vp of 9334. So 9334 already says that, but of course this is going down into a level more detail. And so RVPs or any of these other ones can provide hints or suggestions where IVP being the most obvious one but just expect into a level more detail. And so RVPs or any of these other ones can provide hints or suggestions where IVP being the most obvious one by just explaining that those are hints or suggestions. So the verifier honor could override those if there was a need to But it certainly makes sense for those hints and suggestions. They are pretty typical So that was what we added for that one Next slide All right, so this one could be read either of two ways. And the author is intended for it to be read one way and Ned read at the other way, and we looked at it and says, you're right, that is ambiguous okay? And so the text below is the old and the new one combined there where if you read it the wrong way, then you read it as follows. We currently assume that reference value providers and endorsers typically provide the same information Well, that is not true and not what we have intended to say. And so what we meant to say, we currently assume that reference value providers typically provide the same information with potentially large number of clients And so it's the same across the receivers not same between the senders right was the intent right and so we were same information with potentially large number of clients, okay? And so it's same across the receivers, not same between the senders, right? Was the intent, right? And so we removed and endorsers there to make it clear what same means as same to a potentially large number of clients and then we have the green text at the end that says we also assume the same that true has been endorsers, right? Endorsers also provide the same information to a large number of receivers, typically but of course different from what reference value providers provide"

    "startTime": "00:10:00",
    "text": "So clarifying what the right way to mean, it would say same was. And so we believe this is far less ambiguous because we agree it was confusing before All right, next slide Now I get to ones that's an actual technical point okay so this is an actual technical change other ones are maybe editorial certifications or make it mean what we kind of meant instead of what it seemed to say. This one is actually a technical point, okay And so what it used to say is that endorsers should not use conditionally endorsed values based on immutable values Okay. So this is a section about conditional endorsements or, you know, conditionally endorsed claims And so this one said you could do it based on where it was the if part is not a mutable value but not based on an immutable value, like a serial number And Ned puts back on that and we scratched our heads and said, well, we can't even remember where that came from and we agree. And so we changed this And so it no longer bans use of conditions based on minimal values or anything else with that matter And indeed, the example that Ned provided, we added that into the example so the previous paragraph ended with an example about, you know, a condition based on mutable values And so we kept that one, but then we also added, the example based on the condition based on immutable values that we got from NEDs. And so now it reads an endorser for a given CPU u might provide additional state or an endorser might provide an additional information that if the serial number is in a given range, then a specific security guarantee is present So thank you, Ned, for the suggested example. We took that So that is the main technical change in the document. This is still only part of the issue there So if anybody else has a reason why this was there in the first place, we're interested but only if you disagree, because we remove the we just make it be more general. So, all right Next. Okay Second part of this comment was, um, observed that there was text that was kind of vague It said, well, talking about how state matches reference value"

    "startTime": "00:12:03",
    "text": "and it leaves a lot of imagination of the reader to figure out how this works. True And so we added two new paragraphs. One, at the beginning and one after an intermediate paragraph, that's the dot dot there. So both of these paragraphs are new but they're not adjacent So the first one says, and by the way, the what's published there can contains some grammar issues, and so I'm showing you the copy that is in get GitHub right now that would be in draft 03 once it gets back It says the example in figure one showed evidence containing actual state, for layers one through n, and an endorsement contained actual state for layer zero, right? This is in the earlier section before we even introduced the concept of conditionality However, some claims in endorsements might be conditional and so are only treated as actual state at the condition is met. And now we explain how the matching algorithm works at least conceptually, right? You can implement it whoever you want, but here's a conceptual algorithm says thus actual state is determined by starting with a collection of unconditional claims and adding any conditional claims whose conditions are met based on the actual state. This process is been repeated until no more conditional claims are added That's kind of the conceptual algorithm that iterates through to say what conditional claims applies. You keep adding them and so one might be conditional based on another one, based on another one, and so on. You keep doing this until you don't add any, and then you're done. Hey, Dave, I'm going to give you a two minute time check meaning you have two minutes left I should have a 15-minute slots so I should have seven minutes left Okay, you're down to six minutes All right, then next slide Okay I won't use six minutes. I've only got three, four slides here, so we're good Section 4 readability. This one has a number of different things that Ned called out as editorial issues, and so I'm going to highlight"

    "text": "three of them in different slides. The first one is about the title of the section, okay Graph 0 called Endorsing Identity Some people didn't like that, and so draft 01 had endorsing evidence provenance Ned found that even more confusing, right? The heading is not an entwage concept, so you didn't have to explain that And so what the GitHub version has, meaning the one that is going to go into 03, unless I get feedback otherwise, is endorsing verification keys okay and so you'll see in the other comments here all this stuff is about the same section. And so that's the heading of this is endorsing verification keys. And I think Ned has already seen all of these, right? And all these are Ned's feedback. But if anybody else in the working for see in the other comments here, all this stuff is about the same section. And so that's the heading of this, is endorsing verification keys. And I think Ned has already seen all of these, right? And all these were Ned's feedback. But if anybody else in the working group has feedback, you know, feel free. So next slide Okay. So, uh, one, I'm going to summarize or quote Ned here that what it should really say is that we think evidence should be authenticated that could be stated more plainly And Ned said maybe a different approach would be to explain that attesting environments, that's the AEs, a testing environment, have attestation keys that authenticate evidence and that provenance of attestation keys is needed to build trust in the attestation environments And so then Thomas prepared some text for to address that and incorporate basically that suggestions there. And so again, here's the text that is there in the GitHub version, ready for 03 now unless there's feedback otherwise Testing environments have cryptographic keys that allow authentic the evidence that they produce, right? You'll see that's basically taking Ned's suggestion directly And then a little bit further down, endorsing the linkage between such verification keys and they're associating a testing environment is crucial to the verification process There's a bunch of other text in there, but this is the new text if you will, that helps to just state much more plainly that evidence is authenticated and what that"

    "text": "actually means, and it really means about the verification keys, hence the title of the section now And then part three of this one next slide. This is the last one with actual con means and it really means about the verification keys hence the title of the section now and then part three of this one next slide this is the last one of actual content here Nick commented on the sentence that said, evidence typically contains an identifier for the attester and the work typically is in there and he said, well, you know, there's things like, the DAA, the anonymous attestation. And so maybe we shouldn't say what's typical. And so we said, fine Evidence can contain an identifier for the attester. And now we just don't see what's typical or what's most of the time or anything like that And sometimes it can and sometimes it won't. So And then there was another phrase that was maybe ambiguous or confusing admitted which used to say no particular algorithm or crypto it won't. So, and then there was another phrase that was maybe ambiguous or confusing, admittedly, which used to say no particular algorithm or cryptographic protocol is assumed for the verification And Ned said, well, you know, both the attester and the verifier both have to have the same protocol and algorithms So you kind of have to assume one that this is the one that the other one has, right? And that wasn't the intent, the original intent was this document doesn't assume anything of course implementations will and so what instead we did was we changed the sentence and now it says specific protocol document are also responsible for documenting what particular algorithm or cryptographic protocol is used for the verification. The word also is in there because there's also a sentence elsewhere not too far from here which says what specific protocol documents are responsible for documenting. And so this induced just adds another bullet to, if you're going to write a document that says, here's a protocol, then here's another bullet that you're going to come if you're doing, if you're supporting endorsements So there you go those are the summary of all the changes both in o2 and what's currently pending in o3 And so that will take me to the last slide which is the goal is a anything else that somebody brings up here will try to address and then we'll submit draft 03. If there's no feedback then we'll go ahead and submit 03 right now, or our hope is"

Why is it not possible to have it in the nine? as an enhancement of that? that? It's essentially a part of Fred's architecture, right?

You validate your crypto, the crypto around your evidence.

I think I will find it again I'm here to my badge. I lost it somewhere. I think I will find it again that I lost and found. I'm here to update the working group on reference interaction models. It has been simmering for ages next slide please please And there weren't as much comments on it as there was the last iteration So the I think major one was that it was once upon a time as a test a little bit focused on hardware security models, especially TPMs, and the world has a evolved a little bit. TPMs are flavors now The TPM specification is the relevant part here. There can be equivalent hardware in bigger silicon"

If you have any objections for them, but I think that's okay. So next slide, please We had review from Hannes. Thank you hannes uh hannes uh board up three items and it was like, why are you? using, why you're just making up new words, like like, new funny words, like a handle not use nons and epoch? ID and specific items over all the interaction models you describe. So the point is that nonses and epoch IDs serve certain similar purposes and we introduce an umbrella term that's called a handle We introduced that term now better highlighting why we are doing that so that the interaction model become comparable. So when you're switching for a example, from a standard challenge response model to a subscription model, that you know, okay, I can't use an exit nonce anymore because obviously not just with ones But it kind of serves the same purpose, either providing you some idea of research that you can derive freshness for them that can give you directly freshness and it sometimes is a replay attack protection So that's useful, I think, and I hope we accomplished that. So Hannes approved the changes and assumed that therefore from his point of view accepted We also highlighted that there is an incensation, specification of the epoch IDs, which is the epoch markers and the reference to that, that work also evolves and might be even done before this document here Then there was this assumption"

We thought that the optionality of claims that actually was good enough, but obviously for the comment reader of The default fallback is to just get some evidence with some claims in it. We thought that the optionality of claims detection was good enough, but obviously for the comment reader was not. So we elaborated on that optionality and the fallback behavior Then there was a good discussion about because we have this key attestation a term floating around an IETF right now and we were going with these very old terms like authentication secret ID and nobody could correlate these two terms, so we just switched to attestation key ID and now everybody's like oh yeah so when you do the key attestation, it's probably about the attestation key, right? So that makes a lot of sense. So that is just a relabeling. It happened all over the document even in the flow diagrams, the, the, um, the accruinal of it was changed and everything should be consistent now And yeah, so we have improved the wording about knowing that attestation key. So the spoiler here is sometimes we actually don't even know that. So when you request evidence, you might not know who gives it to you That's a thing. I'm not entirely sure how useful that is, not knowing the identity of the testing environment that reports highly critical evidence may be to you, but there might be scenarios where this is not possible, so the verifier might not know attestation keys at all And so, yeah, okay, we just spend that out. Yeah, that is, again are all obvious to us, but we are only seeing the trees"

Should we do a tentative working group last call and therefore so solicited some more eyes on this? Because this is a relatively old ID now and has grown in complexity and needs some re-review. The last review about we did is like two and a half years ago that's a little bit long So I think we should kick that off because this is now a very often cited but for most people already boring document because people know what's in there, but in order to push it over the, what could call us? triggering SEC idea or something. So we can do an early SEC review. Exactly That's relatively early. We can do a working group last call here yeah thank you Well, that's basically it so um yeah it has it has grown in complexity over time I wished it would just be three models and everything is a okay but then the hubs hub thing is with broker and without brokers and there are some flavors of it. And then inter grown in complexity over time. I wished it would just be three models and everything is okay. But then the Pupsub thing is with brokers and without brokers, and there are some flavors of it, and then interaction models suddenly are nine Well, there we are, but it's defined there and it's really useful for for implementers to choose something that is not a standard challenge response interaction because some there is a bias in the community that you do remote attestation with the challenge from the very verifier, the challenge from the verifier, which is, I think, only a very specific subset of how remote attestation works today.

Like, I'll give a simple example You define something called streaming, a streaming attestation. I can think of ways to relate that to attestation and a TLS session continuity context, as an example I don't know if that was really the intention behind your document to apply it to a test as a kind of protocol binding existing protocol. So, for speaking now, taking on the point of ATLS I think it's super useful to say this is base, this is based on the streaming road attestation because we're used this and this and this, but we are also adding this and we are not using that option.

And technically, this is just cozy armor around CWT claims set so the green thing is the CWT claims set and we can put a cozy envelope around that tag it with tag 61 and then we have a CWT So this is the construct that we have been using for a lot of things Now the interesting thing is that the green stuff sometimes has a life on its own.

We had this discussion before in the reference interaction model. You can use them for recentness They can use them for freshness proofs. And you could say it's mostly a multi-party nons because multiple rats rolls in one reds system receive the same epoch marker, understanding that this is the current age of freshness. So if you get evidence from a pre- one reds system receive the same epoch marker, understanding that this is the current age of freshness. So if you get evidence from a previous epoch marker, it's immediate stale That is a highly scalable system for housing center and thousands of closely local things, typically clouds and such but also other scenarios where you have highly critical infrastructure and you have data diodes where you can only see data in and that literally no data comes out, then you can push a e-pot marker in. So there is a lot of interesting user scenarios where E-Poc markers. It scales where it's cheap and also allow you to only have one very expensive clock I know if everybody is working with time here you know the whole expensive, precise or good action it's cheap and also allows you to only have one very expensive clock. You know, if everybody is working with time here, you know how expensive, precise or good, accurate or even useful time is So there are examples here, an ePort marker can have several contents. You can literally put something like a nonce into the content and it's probably working in simulator or nonce.

What we're trying to accomplish here is have a universal way to send a small summary report of whatever you're trying to assess So how many are familiar with this is digs and CIS benchmarks that give you like a set of policies that you measure? your software against? It could be operating systems, could be applications, and there's hundreds of them. So these are existing industry standard documents. So the purpose here is to have a standard way to communicate the result of an assessment that happens locally because that assessment might be quite verbose and you're not going to send the whole thing over if you're going to do this at runtime because it's just too expensive if you have 100,000 nodes on a network and they're running multiple applications and you want to do frequent assessments. You don't want to send the whole bulk thing over So what we'd like to do with the working group, which is why the draft isn't finished, it's the the idea is that we'd like consensus and we'd like to make sure the use cases for this broad set of things are covered in what we'd like to exchange online to have consistent reporting. Does that make sense? So we just want to send to like a CSPM if you think about or a GRC, a governance risk compliance system, or a cloud security posture management system is going to receive like a summary report says, this is good this is not good.

This draft doesn't worry about it. It's only setting up the interoperability for I checked for this specific bench at this level. So does it meet a high level of security for Ubuntu or for, you know, Apache or something else? And that result is sent in a way that it's expected with a time back to the logs on the system for transparent TPM is represented in the system or in the draft right now, and that's one of the reasons that Monty said that he would help So one of the upcoming versions will have other methods besides TPM included so that it's a broader scope because there are multiple ways. You might assess locally and then report So we want to be able to represent how that was done so people can say oh okay I trust this I don't trust this, or how they categorize it in their systems does that make sense Yes, I'm getting some nods Yeah, yeah, I'd rather make sure we have an understanding of this Just a scoping question. So is, I don't see in the list at the bottom where you have the platforms that trusted execution environment, and just a clarification question, whether it is out of scope for this work Can you repeat that? I'm sorry. So trusted execution environment so you mentioned the container so can they be confidential containers or is your scope? only limited to these kind of devices which include people?

And so this would be a less expensive in terms of operations option to show that it hasn't been tampered with Okay, then I will suggest adding that in the document because I don't see a trusted execution environments being mentioned. That was one of the things, Monty planned to add. Oh, okay. Thank you And even specific ones because there are some specific you know, not everybody uses the open standards so if there's a way to represent it we'll make sure we get consensus from the working group in terms of what we need to represent.

And then I have Kubernetes and then I have a complex container image on top Is that a use case that you care about? Well, so you would decide, do I want to run this assessment? or not? You could run the assessment and then use or not use the reporting, right? So you might send it, let's say you're a SaaS provider, you might send it within the SaaS provider environment to your management system, or you might even send that as a check to the customer of that instance, right?

Maybe you're posture assessment stays local and then you don't use the reporting feature, right? because you might do your remediation without doing the reporting but I think most would. So I'm when I say that you might not send it I'm coming from a perspective where I supported state, local, tribal, and territory organizations for three years and they have zero resources. So they might be very happy to know everything's good on the system, and they don't have a CSPM, right? They're going to trust whatever management system is doing the attestation right there, they might only have like, you know, a few instances to manage so they don't need to send it to a CSPM they might look within a different system managing the container and that attestation piece would happen and be reported local without needing to send, right? So that's why I think it should be optional but whatever you send needs to be consistent so that whoever sends it um it is parsed and interpreted as a expected, right? So that's the only piece I care about Okay, thank you. I'm just going to do a quick time check You're only on slide two.

Do I get a choice? Like, what's the target? for the kinds of things you're trying to describe with these? So I think it should be done in layers, right?

We also want to identify the measurement itself in terms of it optionally the any version information associated with that. We also want to identify the measurement itself in terms of the digest value and the algorithm that is used to compute them value. And optionally, we want to add any external entities involved in authorizing the component installation on the device This is the signer semantics, right? The signer is an entity that digitally signs the measured component. For example, if you're doing UFI secure boot or you're doing the arm-trusted boot board, the sign is the thing that is associated with, it's basically authorizing the installation of the components. In some cases, there is one single thing in the simplest situation but in more complex situations you might have multiple parties that need to cooperate and indicate collaboratively that they are endorsing or approving the installation of a certain component Next please So we have taken a pre-trial minimalist approach here and we want to keep it that way We don't want this to be extensible in a way It's just a fixed set of attributes that are, you know But if there's anything that is absolutely needed and you want to see it there, please share now so if we consider adding it, for example we were looking at SVNs.

They could be in terms of an inferencing engine or any other types of any other types on a lot of importance in different environments and different applications So ARM actually defined the confidential computer architecture three years ago as a reference architectural design for systems on chips with integrated TVs. You can go on next This is a very kind of high level diagram in mind to actually show how the relationship between the testing environment and the target environment So CCA starts primarily with the root of trust that provides what they call hardware-enforced services for securing the CCA environment and work provides what they call hardware-enforced services for securing the CCA environment.

So has actually provides a platform token. So the platform is the underlying hardware and trusted computing base that is necessary to form the CCA security guarantee. Has all, is also the REL management monitor which operates outside of HES, but is responsible for ensuring isolation of different realms as they come up in the target environment And that, so the HES forms of platform token. The RMM can receive and retreat platform token, but also it forms a realm token. And that ROM token is necessary to attest to the specific realm O tokens are defined in the E format format Okay, so there are two models that are defined in the current draft There's a delegated model where the, which is basically the two token model. Now, what was the realm of management monitor signing the realm adaptation token? with is with what's called a realm attestation key pair. And that's actually generated by a Hesprit of trust.

Yeah, it's up to you. Please. Please so that's on the last slide. Yeah, go ahead Arm has a very strong affiliation with the word token, and I don't like that because in RACS, we have the evidence. So I would like it to be changed to evidence so this token word is really confusing like what does it really represent in terms of rats? So it would be nice to have it platform evidence instead of platform token. And wherever you use, just replace it with the evidence. Okay.

Yeah, so on the direct model, this is a, it is so the so the rmm in this case creates a claim set and hashes it, and the hash is provided to they has wrought and as the challenge data and then the platform attestation key pair is the only signing key pair so this is um little similar to the detached bundle if you're familiar with the EatSpec but it's a little but it's a little bit more of a specific definition.
