But at same time we also added triggers that was proposed by and field where it's more about the notification that you subscribe to something. Right? So you have something there, but but you have the same functions. You gather way rock. So we keep the... We have this six different triggers that we can use scheme. After that, we start the use case. And this is the section that I think it was more missing before because before what we have was just trying to describe the one relationship the client server and that was it. What we see in reality after all these years of implementation is that we have more complex environment and we try to capture there. So we try to capture the most simple one that we had in the past that we have that is such create resource manager and the at same time is the later that have multiple resource subscribers. So the typical client service where you have a client in the service provider. This is the most common one. But after that we start to see other scenarios. So for instance, the resource manager this was created in the play can start to receive information from an external resource manager. But is instance when we have those piece of soft to gather this information from my navy or. And push it to skim client. Okay? So after there we start to get from there.

And after that, we'll have the concept of the external resource creator that also brings two weeks, then after that we have the resource subscriber for instance the typical example of a Slack or a Zoom or a webex that as is authority or should be should create an for the user identifying their communication Id like their for the communication. At that point, they are the ones that are going to create that information, and that information is to be manager, but needed is also to be begin the chat application. Right? So in here, we are starting to see many options, now not only the what scheme was designed the client service, but many different interactions that describes the use case or now skin can be used. And at some point we arrived to the most complex scenarios, where we have multiple resource manager. So for instance Let's say that you have an doctor, you have azure, then you have many applications that subscribe that information. And then you have sources of information for the resource. Object that came from the Aa on pardon. So all of these brings to this use case. Now what we are struggling to be honest and we me the the feedback from many that we thought, okay.

The draft finally has security and privacy considerations and and I and a section There's a couple more things to deal with, we'll get to that in a slide for those who haven't looked at this before, skip events define a series of events it can be shared as security of event tokens, which is specified by Rf eighty four seventeen and transferred by a number of mechanisms, two of them, which are our eighty nine thirty five, I eighty nine three six would describe how a skin may that publisher either push events. To a defined end endpoint or provide a service endpoint such that a client that's behind the firewall can pull to the skin publisher to get the stream of events. And that call based event can be done using long cooling which gives you real time delivery. Either way. So your choice of protocol really depends on whether you're dealing with an administrative requirement that a firewall can't be breach so you can't push to the client. To the receiver. Next slide. So as I mentioned before, we added privacy security and for privacy and security basically, it's building on the security and privacy considerations stuff"

And the other commentary is your sharing information between parties that have already agreed to share information via the in protocol to begin with. So most of the cases we're not opening up. And we also have the choice where there's a more arms length relationship where you can have just notifications that certain attributes have changed and then the receiver the event can call back and ask that information which is then when you could have an authorization check to see if your access all allow of certain attributes to be seen. So that's what sort of laid out in respect. Guess revising of this spec in order to form with the Open Id shared signal framework which requires use of the subject identifier spec, which is just nearing Rf completion I've put in the name of the draft, and it's just in the R editor queue now. So by a time, we publish it will also be an Rf. So it's good to get that in. That also opens up some flexibility where we don't just have to use skin like ids and external Id. We could include in the subject identifier an email address or a username something that's unique that the parties to agree on So that's talked about in a spec. Section two continues to define in the four classes and events. If you're wondering where the formatting came from the where when we send the full transaction, it really follows the skin bulk"

So we're not finding anything new there. Then we have feed control events if you have a case where you don't want the entire server sending events about everything in the server. You can add and remove subjects to the feed. This is part of shared signals. And how they do things. So we're supporting that. Provisioning events is basically the skim credit operations. Signal events are high level events that people wanna indicate such as an authentication factor was changed or a password was reset that comes from the in the system. Async events was mentioned by Hollow, which is to indicate some long running request that's now completed. I know with my previous employer, they had some things that take twenty, thirty minutes and the client wanted to know when it finished. So that that helps support that case. Next slide. Section three, talks more about how and when the secure events when do use Jake plain, text, j t, one do J aws signing wearing encryption and what's appropriate. You you can you can do the can't in security and you do a lot of security thing and end up with too much security.

And the signatures event not only gives you the authenticity beyond what Tls already told you it's also useful if over time, you wanna verify that event that was sent a long time ago that's in your local database. Was actually signed by the issuing authority. And then encryption, is for improved confidentiality for some reason. You need end to end encryption. To where they the end that processor receiving it. That's all in there and the reasons why and why on are there. There were some comments before that eighty nine thirty five and eighty nine thirty six don't provide recovery. I think one of the things I sort of realized is that some people are thinking of classic ldap servers and techniques that were used to change log. And that was I wanna do a recovery and look at the entire change log. And rebuild my server. That's a very different thing when we're talking about point to point coordination where I have a network of skin stem service providers on one side. And a database or a directory on the other side, and their unlike infrastructures and just again, part of the cross main thing But what we're talking about is recovering of the sequence of events that goes on. One of the things the psycho events were cited was that long term recovery is up to the receiver of the event. So the way the protocols were is they support short term recovery only they don't mandate it the short term, it could be infinite recovery as well. But the real idea is that once you acknowledge an event"

The idea is to ensure that an event was successfully transferred in then receiver or stores that in its database, and the long term recovery that it needs in its infrastructure it's supported by the receiver. That's great because it also means the receiver doesn't have any architecture design photos and pins not it you a great. Point of d location between service providers Salesforce can't tell on how hypothetical salesforce can't tell hypothetical Microsoft what to do vice versa so you you're getting another notification events and you do with the events, what you wanna do and you retain them for as long as you want. So that's that's the kind of recovery that this supports. So next slide. Phil you've only got about a minute left. Yeah. Okay. Couple more than I've mentioned these that this is just following on, that's quite natural. Just go to the next line. There is a I issue that Amanda just brought up for me from the Team that there is no registry for set events For some reason, the second group decided not to do that. So we have a choice where we could work with the broader community and established in event registry that'll be controversial like they because the second group didn't want one we could flip this around. So it's you are It, sci and then event. Because there is a registry under sci and we could register them there. Or we could just argue. There's no need for it. We're published it in the Rf and it's just an abstract. You uri. I"

My suggestion is we'll just set up a names space on skin that we can administer for ourselves even though we might never change it, I don't know. If people see future events, we could add to it or somebody else could add to it. So I don't know if anybody has any thoughts. That was the main feedback. And then the last slide, I'll just go to that real quick. I'm working on a couple of implementations, there's as far as set transfer. There are a number of commercial implementations but a public open source one is the shared Signals dot guide website, and I should be publishing one too call called go signals. And that should give us more of an interrupt. In the case of the skin events, These are just just done just registering yvette sc And so the the actual complex part, being protocols already implemented it's already running. But it would be nice to do that. The It skin dot io server haven't released it yet, but it's already been doing replication events for quite sometimes using another protocol, but it that all works. So signaling nature of skill events sufficient. For people to set that up if that's what they wanna do. So that's it. You can take questions now or later depending on the time. Great. Thanks. We don't have much time, but Elliott did you wanna something really quick. Yes. I just wanted to ask the question. What would the call us need for the registry?

Talk on this subject before. So first, just a quick sort of administrative thing, the Cursor based imagination draft was written by Matt Peterson back in I think like twenty seventeen. He has had to change an employment and has... He doesn't have time to work on this anymore. So he has handed it off to a group of enthusiasts listed on the slide. I'll be myself Dean Angel, and also David who is not here at tonight. And then next slide, please. So the main thing that we wanted to address like with our time today. Is some of the feedback on the call for adoption and how we plan to address it. So we have a a couple of slides just, you know, pointing to specific concerns that were raised. And the changes that are going to happen as a result of that. Out to the to the draft. So there were concerns about denial of service possibility. I I think it was mostly in the context of if like the, like, state or the snapshot of a response. Was being held by the sci service provider that a malicious after could open one or more cursor and try and keep them alive for a long time and is exhaust. The the the memory or storage or whichever of of that server. Similarly there was also somewhere we hash."

That if implement were to lock resources that were included in a page that was being earned from being changed. That that would be a security issue as a actor could lock the, like, the ability of a set of resources. In a cursor and use active prevent things such as dea activation of a of a user. When they should otherwise the be deactivated. Say or, you know being terminated or topic. So the response to that that will go into the draft There'll the explicit guidance that the Cursor is not expected to be stable. It I think Dean and Angel, keep me honest... I I think right now, it's the wording is effectively that that I I we say it's not expected to be stable. We don't we don't use like, a capital should or a must or anything in the wording at this point. I I think mostly for a like more ease of adaptability, I guess. So that... If the underlying data store if, you know, somebody need the snapshot actually is going to be faithful. And it's not a burden actually, you know, it'd be a burden the other way to do a stateless snapshot of the set of resources. You know, snapshot... Sorry. The the list of resources, but not any other data about them like attribute values. But anyways, It's... Sorry. It's very late here. Yeah.

And we know a few implementations that if it's using rest less than it is expected to be stateless. So with that consideration in mind, since we are not proposing that underlying implementations would lock any resources, the security concern becomes invalid Yep. To the next slide. Additional requirements for change or detection change detection on delta where abilities were were added So a response to that is that change detection does query it's not a requirement with valuable complimentary functionality for large client activity and we not saying that customer base imagination is up red prerequisite or mandatory for implementing change or delta queries, imagination in general, is an to index customer based imagination as in general.

So objective seems to be contradictory through trajectory. That's what I'm confused about. I think what the initial drives proposal was to provide an alternative mechanism to index space imagination, not essentially targeting that we do not want to allow resources to change. Customer based imagination in general if the underlying resources are being changed, it does not lead to the issues that index based imagination, creates which is skipping off records or are essentially duplicating some of the records, so it in that mechanism, it is... Yeah. It provides a different behavior. And second reason why we are providing an to index based imagination is that underlying in databases may not implement index based imagination and by t default. So in order to support index space imagination such implement would have to do a translation layer and which requires scans of large data and building those indexes, which adds to the complexity. Have to leave it to the others to Do that because I don't know that that would set up their objective which was was to reconcile all the records between two servers using paging."

The results, the the actual data that the indexes give to you may change maybe stay less, but result set? That you get? Should be state in my understanding. Maybe that's just something you need to clarify in the text. Yeah. I I think the text needs refinement. What what you just said is be in added goal... If I understood you correctly, the set of results returned is should be captured in a state. The act any given like attribute value though. Can be a, like, point of time when do you load that specific age rather than everything having to be snapshot you have to be very beginning when you pull the first age out of, you know, a thousand or ten thousand pages. We'll, yes we can refine the the the text Yes. And I think Angel so as well, remember, if you look in the intro to this document, What you'll see is that the intent was to provide an alternative to index space pa imagination. The intent of the dock was not to provide a mechanism to synchronize large datasets across across client and server, but provide an alternate to that index based imagination when the underlying database does not support"

The goal really is to automate all or most of provisioning of devices. Using basic cr operations. Means. This is all review. So I'm not I'm gonna go pretty quickly. Is a set of skim extensions that enabled device provisioning. There's also A extension that permits the device manager device manager endpoint registration. I'll go through that flow a little bit in this time because I it wasn't clear the last time. And then obviously, we're doing... We're we're reusing the the sc, and that includes Skin groups. And they turned out to be important, and I'll discuss that at a future time. Next slide. So here's the basic model. That green line, where it says provisioning skin."

    "text": "Is really... It can actually be many different parties, it can be... It can use certificate based authentication or user based authentication depending on the type of party that that is. The object that being provisioned is a device all the way on the left for purpose of network access. The sort of capabilities that are required of the enterprise network on the left. Depend on the type of device. So for Wifi for instance, the only thing that's needed is for the device to get onboard it. For B, actually, you need to could create a data path and a control path which are which is the red line and the blue line here. And this and the extension scheme is defined essentially device control mechanism using either hd or m, and a device to telemetry, Scheme. This is the device saying, hey. I'm I'm I'm generating... This is also events. So it may be that the device on the left is for instance, a heart monitor. And what's being produced is either analog. Wave waveform information that's been digitized or simply periodic digital updates depending on where the patient is, and so that information would come across on the blue line. These two red line and blue line endpoints are defined in the sc up So that's roughly speaking the the approach. Next slide, please? Actually, I'll just pause on the previous slide for just a moment. Does everybody have a a pretty comfortable understanding as to what we're attempting. There any concern if if there if they're clarifying questions here, I would take them. Okay. Moving right along. So how do we do this? How many sc are defined? And we are... We we find a core device scheme actually has very little in it."

    "text": "Just a display name and admin state. And an optional mud url that you can describe what sort you can point to an s bomb for the device of software bill materials. You might point to access controls if you want that's up to the manufacturer. The B extension contains various authentication mechanisms support or Mac address randomization through ir case. And also now, I think there's a change in this scheme, that also will support sort of, sort of basic offset based privacy, which is sort of pseudo privacy, but that's what a lot of B. People do. And we're not trying to fix B. We're just trying to document how to at the darn thing onboard it. And how to communicate with it. The other extension is Wifi File and its easy Connect, which basically is a device provisioning protocol And this goes with Basically, this is just about getting Wifi access mostly, And for Wi access, this just a... You you need to have trusted introduction and that's what the Qr code provides. Least see. Public key and a little bit more information. We've done sort of the same thing for Zig. What's... And then we provide endpoint applications. I'll talk about that in a moment. The other sc that we're pondering, we haven't quite done this yet is matter. The reason we haven't quite gotten around to matter yet, this because matter is not really yet enterprise capable for my perspective. When it is there there's a natural extension to be on there. The endpoint applications extension, if you go back to the previous slide just to highlight that It's those red lines and blue lines and it provides for authorization tokens so that the device control and data receiver on the right are authorized to connect to the gateway to receive of this information."

    "text": "And it is the gateway. A gateway in this slide is indeed the this skin. So that's... We we can move forward again. And again, So the big changes since London, based on those input and others, we're just using the sci description in the draft now. We've moved the open Api scheme it to the appendix. There's a lot... I I did a lot of formatting quote improvements. I ended up folding some Json examples. And and and God, that's gross, but you know, it's done in the core scheme. So... And what do you do. That's something that we can't fix in this working group. There's some nice pretty tables with all the attributes laid out in terms of their properties. In in nice skinny fashion. And we've updated the examples. Next slide. So we're now also working on some open source. For this to to release, I'm not sure the timing of that, but it will surely will surely be before October m maybe before July, for people to play with. The open source will be client code primarily. So the client code will be focused on how do you provision a device into a network. We might also do some server code. We we haven't quite gotten that far, but we wanna make sure that there's we client Sdk out there. The specification is you know, sort of beginning to mature. We're not making a lot of changes to the text now. So we of like the working group to think about taking this on. And maybe calling for an option. And along those lines, if you are interested in improving a draft, we'd like to see her your your inputs because we don't claim expertise and I would really love for the cursor people to to help me out a little bit and also fill in terms of events. Really, we're using M q t for events, but there might be some things we can learn from youtube too there."

    "text": "That's it. So Elliot, did you get feedback from the draft zero version zero. We did we got some feedback from most of the feedback was around the form that the form of the sc. And so we we reacted to that and basically use the this the with approach, and we also had some conversations with various big players. As you we who who can speak for themselves if they wished for, but I'm not gonna mention. Can't remember what I have no excuse. Can't remember if you had just updated the the draft elliot. I we updated it. Well, we we... We I think we In November, we submitted it for its first round of review. Basically, for people to get a look at it, and now we we've taken comments and so we sort like to do a working group call for adoption. That should either bring people in or repel them depending on how you look at the draft. Well, and that's that the reason why I asked if anybody had provided comments on the previous one was to see if we needed to solicit volunteers to review as we do the call for adoption. I would love to take volunteers for that. You know, always, you know, I don't think you did that the last time I would love to to to have additional volunteer volunteers. I know Phil, took a look at it. And I appreciate that paul. And I think one or two other people also did as well. Okay. Well, We can go ahead and do the call for adoption. Elliot"

    "text": "we can start it. We could do given this is an It week we may just do, like, a three week Yeah. Or just started next week. Or... Yeah. I would say start next week. You got you guys have plenty to do in japan already. So, basically, we we need at least three people to to time in on readiness for the draft. So I can either ask volunteers explicitly now or just rely on the on system. And if we don't, then I will do it on the mail list. To force the issue. Okay. Alright. Okay. So with that, We actually have three minutes left. For any other business, So this is open time. Does anybody have any other issues topics. That they wanna raise and discuss before we close. Going once. Going twice I won't say dealer. Alright. I think we give you a hold two and a half minutes back. And let the remote people sleep Go ahead. Yeah. Great. Thanks. Thanks everybody. Thanks for calling. Make sure you scan in if you didn't already. Few more thank you. Alright. Thank you everyone, especially those who are dialing in remote and a non godly hour. Enjoy the rest of the week. Looking at the"
