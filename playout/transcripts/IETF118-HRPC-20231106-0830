This is human rights protocol considerations research group And we have a a 2 hour session for you. The agenda is up. And I'll walk you through, some of our introductory materials Just checking if my co chairs online Sophia Sully is the co chair of HRPC with me, and she's not able to be in and hoping that she will She will come online at some point. So welcome. So, This is our agenda for today. We have 3 talks. We have Ahmad Alsa Alsidy online. Who's gonna start us off. We have also another online speaker from the office of the commissioner on human rights. And then in person, we're happy to welcome Stephanie from the, UNFPA, which is the agent in the UN, responsible for, Gender rights and and gender justice. So, then we have a few, small matters for the research group at the end, couple drafts, bit of a discussion, but that's how we'll spend our time together. So just a few reminders. You need to make sure you, capture the QR code with your with your mobile phone to sign in for the blue sheets. You can also do it by walking in with your laptop,"

We're going to be capturing in the notes only the discussion follows the talks since the slides are available online, in any discussion we have at the end around our our research group drafts. And so for Q And A, when that is when that happens after each talk. And at the end, please, if you can use the meat echo So going back to capturing this QR code, it gives you a tool that you can then raise your hands and then you can also then come to the mics that are in the aisle. That allows us to make sure we can get people that are joining us online as well as in person in the same in the same queue. Since this is the beginning of the week, you may not have seen this these slides yet, the note well, are essentially There's a few different sections to the note well. The first is around intellectual property. So if there's any discussion where you hold intellectual property rights on or you know someone else does, you need to note that well and actually say something. We've already gone over this, but we're recording this audio and video recordings. The good thing. But you need to make sure that if you're wearing a red lanyard or you have a red dot or however you indicated that that if you come to the mic, you'll be captured on video. Another important one Another important section of the note well is around code of conduct. So we do have guidance for conduct in meetings, interims and meetings like this one. On the list and so on.

You thought that the work that you're talking about is most relevant to SDOs that act like businesses, but many SDOs don't act like businesses. Their standards are not for sale. They're openly available. So are they out of scope of the work that you're talking about Thank you. Hello. Thanks for for the question. And it's, it's a useful clarification. I I can make it. So firstly, on expanding our work, We Plan to to, hire additional staff. We'll to be frank one further moment. It has been delayed for budgetary reasons, but should be done, very soon. And then, hopefully, we can the, do I will work in a more sustained way on your other question, That's, more of a It's well, well, Our recommendations are our analysis applies to all standards developing"

I gave irrelevant in all this context. Because we have the real life impacts the guiding principles on business and human rights our definition applied to businesses, but not others. So you could make the distinction say, well, there's no obligation and no responsibility. On on on other other forums where standards are being developed But that would be, in my view, a rather legalistic distinction but to be legally correct, I refer to businesses in my in my initial remarks. Hope that helps. Thank you. So we have Nick, in the queue who's online. So, Nick, if you can come on camera, if you would be comfortable, if not, fine, but, we can hear you now. Yeah. Sorry. Audio only. It's very It's very early here. Thank you for the presentation. I I maybe wanted to add a problem to your list of problems, about, forum shopping that that that there is some danger that there's no particular path that standards need to follow, and there's lots of standards development organizations out there. I I am quite concerned about the question of states advocating or delegating authority to less transparent bodies, and we see that a lot in the United States where, standards might be developed in a a national hands body or an international standards body, where those standards aren't available to the public, even though they may be incorporated"

Are the expectations, for a standard's body to have gentlemen, multi stakeholder. Process such that it can be, suitable for for, for reference. Than some legal settings. That's that's that's an excellent question. It it's a problem, and it I I that that's huge in, in my opinion, and that's why refer to it, I don't think that you can completely excluded as a problem, certainly not coming from the end. We have, limited power and for for understandable reasons, there would be quite a bit of opposition we had outsized power to determine who could determine standards where but, your thought about baseline guidance is something that I find quite attractive and would go to the list of expanding work. In the reports, we addressed some of the issues But in a wealth, concise way we have 8500 words for these reports. But it would indeed be an important topic to take forward and and and see how we can"

So I noticed tension between two points that you made. I wanted to ask about it. The the first was how there should be sufficient democratic participation in this, and making process. And and the other was the recent trend towards states to centralize or exert more control. Over technology and standards. And I was wondering if there's been any analysis on the, like, an outcome based analysis of when standards bodies to involve governments, impact does it have on human rights? Is it helping human rights hurrying human rights. And, that could be used as kind of guidelines for Sanders bodies to know how to engage with state actors, and but also balance that with human rights considerations. I I'm not aware of her of her specific analysis on comparison to what degree state participation Has an impact on, how the resulting standards, effect, human rights. That could be an interesting"

And where we have all kinds of states, some with better, some with terrible human rights track records where rule of law and, which governments, for their week. We have to deal with both And, That's Stronger dissipation, especially in, more state focused processes, is is is one one way to balance, balance things out. But, certainly not a miracle cure when when when the problematic pushes towards towards towards, solutions and standards that could be problematic for for human rights. So to summarize I I agree there's tension. And, and in-depth study on outcomes, of standard setting processes, where states have a particular role to play.

I just want to ask how can we make things more concrete for protocol designers and, our, let's say, product services, what I would like to emphasize is sometimes these topics become nice to have. How can we turn them into requirements? And, in some projects, we are following a concept called Key values. And key value indicators. We even start from UNSDGs and try to develop those into technology enablers and try to track if our, designs and services make an impact to those. Do you think such an approach would work to make things more concrete in terms of how to let's say, carry human rights considerations into design and implementation. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So, Tim, we're gonna take another question that's related, we'll take them together. Go ahead. Hi. Thank you, Mallory. Hi team is Carolina Kyris. Good to see you, again. Yeah, I got guess I I had a a follow-up question, that that, you know, relates to the previous question. I don't know if you can see us, you know, you have quite a backroom here. Of our ETF first, presence. So I was wondering whether there's a specific ask of this community.

Group has has done is I wouldn't say without flaw, but, certainly, ins inspiring and and then something to build on. So I'm I'm hesitant to come from my perspective and then and then and say, you have to do this and, things as I think you should do them on the at the practical level, we have many people in the room you included earlier included others, Nick, and many people, I don't simply don't know. Who I believe have very good ideas and lots of experience in this in space. What I would say more broadly is that would be great. If the work on on on human rights that's being done here. Could be more full heartedly endorsed across communicate more fore heartedly implemented. But that's a matter for the for for the community. And that's a matter that can't be imposed by anyone, but that needs to be done by the people. On the ground. So that would be my my initial reaction to that. 22 Rep this up.

I think this was a really interesting talk. I think, the points you've raised are are really important, and especially about how to operationalize some of the the discussions and make them you know, actually have these issues, considered during the design of first calls is is something which is is really critical. Not so much at a question, but a a a comment, I was really interested in the the the recommendation to monitoring the impact of standards, and and the you know, that this is something that that's challenging for many SDUs. I know the the IETF, for example, doesn't have the the resources or or the ability to to do such monitoring once the standards have been published, although I'm sure some of companies that are deploying the standards, clearly do so. I think it would be an an interesting topic for for the the ICF and and STOs in general to think about how we can begin to close that loop and and what data is available to try and get some insights into you know, how the standards are used and what what impact they're having and whether we can then bring them back for future revisions and so on. So it's something for us to think about going forward, I think. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. And I wanted to relatedly call out in the chat.

If you want to know more about this, please go ahead and and grab this this link, the slides are also shared, on data tracker. So You can also check it out there. This is a report that we produce in 2021, looking at what does this terminology mean? What it include? What does it not? What type of profiles are people that we're looking at that are being targeted by this as well as what type of profiles are there that are the perpetrators of this type of harm. Next slide. To say, there are a lot. There are a lot of things that are included in this. This is not meant to be read in detail, but It includes image based abuse, extortion, hacking, cyberstalking, Doxene, which is one of the bigger concerns that that I have. Deep fakes. These are the types of things that we're talking about when we're talking about TFgbV. So, though, those are we're not going to go in the detail that, but it's something to understand. Before I dive into the guidance that that we wrote here. This is the guidance on safe and ethical, how to create safe and ethical technology. Specifically for GBV programming. So as I said, I sit in the GBV space. So we want technology in our space. We want to come up with cool tools that will help us do our job better.

Quickly, the objectives of this are, 1, what are the benefits that technology can bring? But also what are the risks harms and misuse that it can bring. This is meant as a framework for standards and oversight moving forward. And also, digital interventions process more generally. So to give you an idea of where this came from, we looked at the data privacy and data ethics, best practices and standards. We looked at WHO research ethics, because a lot of this is at the of house, as I mentioned. And then we also have a massive amount of gender based violence or GBB guidance. So we look at both the humanitarian side, as well as the development and the developed situation. Because we are in, which I did not mention, in over 150 countries globally. Work in emergency contexts as well as in develop settings. And then we also looked at the Digital Health space because this is a space that has used to working with sensitive data and has set out some guidance in this space. But as we all know, the gender aspect is something that's not considered as much as we would like So to give you an overview, something I didn't mention is that the, the version that that we have here, is actually an implementation summary.

The idea behind this is that we can have it be a useful tool, not only for GBV providers, but also you all for anybody who wants to work at this intersection because As you know, the gap is wide. As you might assume, most of the caught conversations and talks that I have are with a room full of women. So you can see that, you know, here, Of course, as we know, it's quite the opposite. And We know that there's a gender divide. We know that there's technical gap, Right? We bring a lot of different aspects, different layers of the human the security aspects for for women in particular, but we also don't bring a lot of the technical pieces. Hence why I'm here to hopefully be a bridge. So anyway, this guidance is meant for everybody. So some things might seem very obvious to you and others might not at all. It might be the first time you hear things. So that's why we have our our We have the terminologies. We have core principles. Focused on GDV as well as data. We also look at current technologies. This is extremely basic, but it's just to get everybody on the same page will not go over that today. So don't worry. We have benefits, risks, and then steps. Promising practices, and then annexes. Anix's are great in, to create tools, that you can actually use and implement today. So these are the actual pieces the purple or highlighted versions or what's in the summary.

Of course, similar to privacy by design or security by design, it thinking about safety from the beginning. This term was coined by, the E Safety Commission in Australia. So if you are interested in looking into how they're implementing that. That's where this terminology really would coming from, but, yeah, the idea is thinking about safety as from the beginning rather than as an afterthought. Purpose limitations, so making sure that we have, the scope of the technology, that will that has a clear purpose and is not kind of ever expanding, specifically when we're dealing with, sensitive data. Data minimization, of course, the only way to really be safe and protect data is to not have it at all. So we wanna make sure that the data that we're collecting, is only the essential data, as we move forward in the technology. Proper use of the data. So ethically, gender based violence guidelines require that you do not collect data unless you have a clear purpose. For it for it, so that is something that that we would to be considered before we create it Fairness, I think we all probably agree with that one. I won't go into that. Informed consent, transparency, and ownership. This one is is repeated here because it is so important. When we're talking about consent, We're not talking about a checkbox consent, legal obligations, we're talking about making sure that the survivor, or, the person who whose data is being collected understands what data is being collected on them, how it is being stored, where it's going, what type of risk"

Would you like to continue this, or would you like to stop this process? So I thought that that was a great example of continuous consent Right. It's a simple solution, but if we're not thinking about it, then we're not going to be including that. So that's the, really, about our consent transparency. And then ownership we have in here to kind of start to think and shift our mind around who is the owner of the data that we're collecting. Is it the user? Is it the company? Let's start to kind of think about that, especially when we're talking about highly sensitive data. Did accuracy and quality of data? I won't go into that because I think we all understand that quite well. Security you all are way more experts on data security than I am. So I will not go into that accountability. And then We are unconditional service because we are a union agency, So that is the data specific principles for the core kind of GBV principles, our number 1 is always do no harm. So that means having a risk benefit analysis beforehand And knowing that sometimes doing something is more harmful than doing nothing. So knowing when to move forward with the project, and when to say, No. No. We need to stop this project. It's just something that we do on a regular basis with our programming. Technology aside.

It means let's not assume what people are going through. Let's not assume what is safe for a person or what is not safe for a person. We need to do more research on that. And think about options that a survivor might have. Sorry, might need, in any given situation. So providing those those options because We know that, survivors often do not report acts of violence, and they don't do that because sometimes it is unsafe for them to do that. So we need to recognize that sometimes the solution is not always through the justice system. That's really the bottom line behind to Robert Centered. Informed consent and transparency. I think I went into that again, it's repeated because it is just so important. This intersection, participatory. So This is also somewhat in the human centered design space. But it's really about designing with people bringing them into the problem, not coming in and having a solution and dropping it in, but involving from the the point of ideation, having people who you are intended to be supporting incorporated throughout the entire process. Again, not a checkbox not one off focus group, but incorporated through the design all the way to drained safety aspects through the end.

And then also we have all of the non gendered abuse that can can come as as risks as well. Yeah. There we go. No one Yeah. So anyway, these are a lot of the the issues that we also need to think about. Going forward Okay. So The guidance really is meant as a tool for us to kind of start shifting our mind in how we think about this problem. This is a socioeconomic model. That we use a lot in the gender based violence space. We think about the risk that that any program has to an individual to a community and as well as to society. So this is an idea of of what this would look like at at intersection. I mean, we, of course, have the risk to survivors, but we also have the risk to responders and advocates Myself being here, I understand, is a risk. Because there are people that do not believe it. We should have equality, and could then come after me. Anyway, the results that we really are concerned about is, is death we see that especially, in more, conservative environments, Women not being pictured without being covered, has resulted in in death.

That can amplify gender inequality if we're not considering So this is also meant, for us to kind of look at a different threat actor mapping. We are very used to and familiar with financially motivated hackers, opportunists. But some other groupings of threat actors that we might not be considering as much. Are the perpetrators themselves. I think Thank you so much for looking at intimate partner violence. That's a huge issue, and it's something that we don't consider enough. At this intersection, that includes family members strangers, friends, acquaintances. So I think we're starting to to cover that aspect a bit. But to other groups. You know, I think we also have governments, which generally, of course, this intersection of human rights, we are thinking about how how governments can, can come in and be the threat. But I think something that might be missing is are governments that are specifically wanting to target empowered women.

When you're not properly managing, storing, sharing data. Of course, that can then be intercepted, and and taken by bad actors. So, yeah, it's something that we just like to to highlight. That even the best intended individuals or groups can, can result in the same amount of time. Okay. So we know that there's always a balance that has to be had. We like to point to this 3 legged stool of safety, security, and private see. We really do not encourage the either or discussions. I think it is something that we need to look at all three when we're when we're at this intersection. And this is just something to to highlight that. So what do we do about it? In the guidance, we have 7 17 different steps. Again, this is meant for people who are creating technology for GBV programming specifically.

We have forgive me for oversimplifying, IT. But we have GBV marked out in in IT. This is something that we understand will be, revised later. But the idea is where we can kind of work together. I think the gender based violence space, can be working a lot on the the beginning phases. And then having more of a combination within our ideation prototyping rototyping budget, consent check, and then having more of a joint all the way joint process all the way through the end. So, again, you can find these detailed in our longer version, but have this list again in the short version as well. So what are some of these promising practices? I mentioned, we have safety by design, but we also wanna consider privacy by design and security by design principles. We want to understand and design for the context of the usual the users. Actual needs. So again, try not to make too many assumptions, try to include throughout the process so that we actually understand what is needed.

Thank you. I mean, I think the idea at this point, as I mentioned, is we're still very high level. I mean, part of the interdisciplinary process is to include you all from, from, the beginning or from this midpoint, I think that there are some aspects that that can be included throughout throughout the process, you know, when we look at the principle slide, for example, you know, how how are we looking at consent?"

And could maybe respond if you wouldn't wanna just because we have work in the research group that is about intimate partner violence. There's an adopted research group draft I've linked to it in the chat, but the high level points you can go and read it is Well, we're we're about to get into it, but I I would say we I'm not gonna go into what the draft says. The way the draft started was there was also a similar effort to try to document sensorship techniques using internet protocols. And so folks were thinking, what if we took all of the poorly named apps like spouse wear or or stalking apps, right, and broke them down and looked at how they function because some of them exploit in particular, internet protocols using local networks and try to elucidate for protocol designers how if you consider a local acts if you consider local access to one's device, and the endpoint I know is Sort of contentious place to talk in the IETF. You might actually learn a bit about folks threat models, right, And, so I think we've tried to document that. And and that's sort of where started, but we're certainly having an ongoing conversation about it. While there's not complete overlap with the things that, Stephanie is talking about. It can be helpful I think for implementers as well when they take you know, IETF designed standards and then actually try to build user facing software. Right. I mean, I get that at one level, but the other level. I mean, the idea of those protocol specifications, we don't build in limitations written off So"

There were a couple things that I noticed here that I wanna call out. One is that you said at one point that you didn't feel qualified to speak to us about security protocols and stuff like that. And I actually like to kind of encourage you not to think that way. Because, one of the problems that I frequently see in the IITF is people are very knowledgeable about the technical details of encryption and even sort of how encryption works and how it can be used, but they are not really seriously considering threat models. And that's something that, you know, whether your knowledge of encryption is strong or not. Your knowledge of threat models, I think, is very strong. And that's contribution. It's very important. So so don't hold back on that. And I'm sure there are other things like that that that that, you know, are worth considering. Like, like, don't think that just because we're all a bunch of technical here, and we know what we're talking about on subjects that you don't, that that you should be silent. Even if you're confused, it's important to clear up that confusion rather than just assuming that we know what we're doing because in my experience often, we don't. On that level."

I don't know if if it needs to be in in this analysis, but I was just I just was curious because, you know, there's this problem that, you know, freedom of speech is very important, but it's also easily weaponized and how do we do we address that? So I was just curious if that's something that you guys considered and decided wasn't was out of scope. Yeah. First, thank you for, yeah, for all that you said. It is really helpful. Yeah, I mean, we're here to to work together and to figure out yeah, how to move forward. Yeah, on the freedom of expression, we are involved in that space.

So we are definitely involved in space, but yeah, it is a bit, separate to to the work, but that's a really good, point that you bring up as we roll out the the longer version. That's something that we can definitely consider and and in a great trial. Yeah.

And that drives to the belief people's true identity my identity should be an aspect of how they work online. But there are many, many good arguments for why privacy is innately course, and some people need full. Privacy or sudotomy online. And it's it's an irreconcilable tension. I I think we're probably going to be having a difficult conversation about these things. Somewhat to Bob's comments, protocols we develop have to sometimes carry identity but they very rarely carry any structural intent that says whether it is a pseudonymous identity or a real identity, we don't kind of go into that space, but if you go into the ops related areas, particularly the dialogue with law enforcement, you're probably coming a lot close to that dialogue.

Absolutely. I think it's it's something that we still are having conversations internally about. Yeah.

So just if if you have any pointers or if you can sort of keep helping us, understand, how how we can get participation when we get into these very technical discussions at the protocol layer.

There are a lot of different standards and best practices on how to do that properly.

First, thank you very much for this presentation. I found it very relevant to this work. I I agree that here we are here to do protocols, but as previous speaker said, we are People have very strong on one aspect of security, which is encryption. Not on the overall part of security, think your slides 13, 14, 15 are the one of the triad between safety security and privacy. This is not the first time I see this slide. It's it's think I saw it 2 years ago somewhere else. I I think this is in physics, that's a tree body problem problem That means from a 2 body problem, you can do an equation, but not in a 3 body problem. So 3 star systems are unpredictable. My view on it is like it's worth than that. It's probably like a quantum state. There are 3 LMOs that are in instead that's superpose each other, probacy hate security for good reasons, it has to, it's going to hate it because it has leaks something to a third party, it cannot trust.

You have a real safety issue, which is under complication, So I would really encourage you to, continue on that line and inform us what to learn and discover there because, need to rebalance here, a couple of parties, and heal them, stop the zerotism of privacy or security versus safety because this is going nowhere.

But we started from the perspective of can we under and how some of the, Technology uses, you know, are actually either abusing or leveraging internet protocols, and to try to document that. But first, because the IETF is not a space where there's a lot of sort of explicit or tacit understanding of these issues. We do spend a bit of time and an introduction in a definition section, terminology, to talk about what is, what are some of these things. So it's very similar to Stephanie has just presented to us. It goes in to a categorization of different kinds of technology based intimate partner violence attacks. The first categories around when I I like to think is the attacker you know. So it's someone who potentially has access to you your devices, your your your routers, That's that's got a lot of considerations. I think that we don't often include in our threat models. Then it's the tech based intimate partner, violence tactics. So these are software based tools. These are, you know, location trackers, you know, things like that. We have a bunch of things that don't fall into either of those 2 categories. And then, we talk more about the methods and the tactics actually of the of the intimate partner violence attacks. So And then we have recommendations. So I, I think, it's worth going through if you haven't yet. We, have only just adopted it. It's really only in its 3rd revision.

Many, many years ago at 2 jobs ago. I was working at the association for progressive communications, circa, you know, 2006, although I didn't join that organization until 2012, they APC were going to the commission on status of the women as a UN body and talking about how technology could potentially lead to harm. In in 2006. If you can remember, people were much more optimistic about technology, and it was unheard of to say that it wouldn't be an enabler of all the good things ever. And so it took many, many, many years. In fact, more than 10, to actually even get a statement out of the commission on the status of women that talked about technology enabled violence. I think that 2016. So it's it took a long time to get this conversation going, but now that it's taken off, we have a lot of folks a lot of experts in a in a lot of different domains."

I'm I'm loving how it does get into specifics of what we can do about the issue. But there were some things that that I saw that we might want to also consider. One being the survival profile of the one that I had mentioned previously about, an image of a of a woman, for example, and not having been covered, you know, how we have seen that this has resulted femicide, where women have have been murdered, so we might want to kind of consider that as as one of the other issues, as we we have this paper. I think also, yeah, just in general, to think about the result as death. I think we've seen in know, in the writing that course, we know about the emotional controlling, aspects, but also to consider that that death is also an outcome of this. Also, I didn't see much on, like, livelihood and job loss. Which I think is something else that that happens a lot as well. As far as, like, means of attack go, one piece that we see is very common is children being used, to get access to a mother.

The two paths are Let's publish what we have with some, you know, slight tweaks. But as a more of an essay rather than characterizing in its research, or we remain dedicated to the research portion of this exercise, but then we need to the methodology and sort of revisit some of the or either make it more explicit the methodology or or re up some of those methods and improve the research itself. Those are the 2 paths. I've not had any response to that question because I want the research group to weigh in.

I think two things that I would like to see more of in the draft. I think I think it's briefly mentioned, but One thing is the impact of says censorship on association. Not know, the direct form of blocking or or some amount of restrictions, but more of how users are implicitly prevented from associating together online. And the other thing is the impact of, local platforms because that would also be important to study, as I understand it, the fact at least now the examples that were presented there looks at very high scale blocking of up, popular platforms, but that does not really mean that people aren't meeting or communicating together. Maybe on local platforms. So that would also be I think an area of interest Yeah. And in general, I think I'm pretty interested in this, contributing to it I'd like to fee for the assessment.

I think where I had concerns is, is that it it it it it the way it was phrased was that it suggested some after phrasing suggested a more systematic approach than would actually take so if we if we can rephrase it to you know, highlights that the approach which was taken, the limits of the surveys and so on and to to avoid overclaiming.

This was a search term was how you subdivided them, how you picture represents through sample, etcetera, etcetera. And that week gives a very authoritative document, with probably a much larger set of references and so on. And, you know, that that would be a really impressive research contribution, but obviously a much bigger document and much more you get a little larger perfect or you can just be clear that, you know, it's, you know, the office have picked a few others as as I think Nick said, a few illustrative examples to make point, and it's not a systematic survey, and It's just that the positioning between those 2 approaches and make it clear Is this an authoritative survey, or is this a small scale set case Yeah.
