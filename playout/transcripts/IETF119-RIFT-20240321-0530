Jim has something to say. Sorry, George. And I I just wanted to make a quick comment on the chair slides there. The Yang model document Am I expect I'm expecting that there's gonna be a revision of that. Right? Yeah. Okay. Alright. I just wanted to show this are you gonna wait until after this aspects gone through, or are you just gonna go ahead and do that now? What what send, send Sorry.

Okay. So like the chair said, he huge thank you to everyone who helped us get the work where it is. Right? We got through our ATF last call. So overall, Jim, John, Andrew, Donald Danium, huge thank you, that you know, if we're going over the dock with a fine tooth comb and, well, I think it shows Okay. I'm gonna be a little bit verbose, maybe even a little bit boring, but I thought it was quite important to specifically acknowledge a lot of the AD and reviewer comments and suggestions given the milestone we've just hit. Okay. So the vast majority of the changes were, you know, editorial structural, etcetera, but they were quite important. They did make the document better. So Donald recommended that we bump the overview immediate descendants to their own top level sections. This was a good idea. So they got promoted there's a good deal of formatting and consistency fixes too. Just we used, we'll say idiosyncratic methods to kind of imply that their that certain text has special meaning We align to something that was a bit more clear, you know, kind of"

There were, a fair bit of freezing improvements as well. Donald went through quite a lot of this that, you know, it does make the document flow better in several areas. Okay. Figures and illustrations. Again, Donald thinks here there was there's a lot of, detailed feedback with this. New ASCII version for figure 1, it's basically the same thing. We just revamped that a little bit. There's kind of more room, so to speak, so things feel, less claustrophobic. Another minor thing, there was something sees between using app or Avaya for a different node reachability information. So we kind of converged on on, on at there. We actually removed one of the SBGs for the security model. We had to edit it for part of another change and really, he asked, he does just fine for both formats. We're not really gaining much with the SVG. Figure 8, which is actually It had kind of the symbol for degrees in there. It didn't really play well with certain formats. So we just spelled it out. And then East And West was reversed too, pretty, pretty important for a, protocol that's so, you know, depending on direction. Okay. So there is some IETF tool challenges as well.

So basically all the SCGs or at least a lot of them. Look, allegedly small, on the pdf version. That is automatically generated when uploading. Fixing the ITS tools isn't really part of our charter. But, you know, we can Donald basically pointed out that you know, PDF is not all that great, but what we think we can do is basically just man have the chairs manually upload the locally generated copy of the document because the sizing is appropriate there. Anyway, continuing on. We also have made several mentions of know, Northern view or southern view with respect to you know, fabric, with respect to fabric descriptions and things like that. Couple of reviewers got confused, so we rightfully you know, changed it and added some text to clarify. It's basically Northern View means from the top down and southern view means from the leaf up. Okay. So if you have normative clarifications, nothing really new just cementing some of the things that were already there. Or just making them more obvious. First bit here is pseudo code for the tide generation algorithm. John very astutely pointed out that we have some language that could enable an implementation to not send all of the tides I won't read everything here. But basically, if our And database has tides 1 through 5, and implementation might only send a sub of them because we're using know, at most as our language,"

So what we did was essentially just clarified that suit that were required First, we in that section, we have a kind of a definition for a, you know, filtered, tied, DVD definition that you know, more accurately describes what headers should be contained And that's basically, you know, headers that have been permitted by filtering and lifetime requirements. It is important to call out that this is purely conceptual. There's there's text toward you know, proceeding this in the same section that indicates this, but it matters. We don't need to be. Looking for this construct in implementation. So with that definition, you know, we we tweak the headers definition just a little bit and they you know, where we said at most, we can now say exactly the number of tides represented by that filtered tide DB starting from next tide ID and so forth. Unless, of course, it's it's less in which case we send everything. And then there's just a bit of language that kind of says, hey, will go into a loop and, there's no tides or even if there's, you know, you know, even if there's nothing that we'll send you an empty tide so we don't break synchronization or anything like that. Hey. Next bit, we have to clarify a little bit about attaching prefixes. For context, we talk about this rule of inheritance, is basically during next hop computation for negative disaggregation, basically, it says that the next stop adjacencies for negative prefix are inherited from the longer positive prefix that aggregates it. But if I both items here were simply you know, they were lower case musts before. They should have been normative to begin with. We just"

This is just just this is just so that other nodes in the network don't cause ties to expire early. Oh, okay. New acronym for everybody. So Rain or the rift adjacency in rush notification is what we use to prevent flooding and rush. It might sound like new functionality it's not. John pointed out that we for using, the ECN acronym, but Obviously, that is something that's already in use. So came up with a new one. Know, we we quite like it. But for this one, ultimately, normative wise, it's just another case where you know, we need to go from should to should, normative should. Sorry. Okay. I'm sorry about k. Level determination procedures. Previously, we said that a node that loses all adjacencies how must hold down level computation for quote, unquote, a short period of time, and that wasn't specific enough. So we just say, you know, for at least one second, it still gives us a degree of flexibility for implementation, but, you know, if some, some guidance, so to speak. K. Yeah.

So, you know, the node fabric and port level models give you enough, flexibility there. So Okay. Few references. So ability to draft that move to informative, we the old list references got changed in favor of the new R sees that, that's supersede them. We added a day one book to the informative references to kind of give more kind of implementation specific type information just kind of as a some hints, if you will. Added a reference to random number generation and then we found a better reference for Valley free routing. We know have an eye Tripoli reference that, does a does a better job at it a little bit.
