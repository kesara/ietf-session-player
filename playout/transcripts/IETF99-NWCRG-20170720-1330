    "text": "again what can you expect from the use of signing window codes well we can expect lower FEC related latency for the reason that I just mentioned but we can also expect insist your nutrition improved robustness why well for two reasons essentially because the sliding window will overlap with one another so it will potentially be a good asset in case of long packet losses bursts so that\u0027s one of the reasons and the other reason is a consequence of the first one if you have less latency with this scheme then you can potentially accommodate larger encoding/decoding windows so once again you will gain from this point of view so this is the humid wards but the experimental setup so we compared the ILC which is this lining window that we are proposing to TS VW working group very basic one very basic solution nothing new inside and we compare it with Reed Solomon codes with that are in the old codes with small blocks at least but those are in the old block codes and we also included rata cut comparison radical comparisons unlike richlum on are far from in the oil especially when you are considering small blocks which is the case here so you need to set up a few tricks we need to artificially divide packets into sub packets or symbols into sub symbols in order to artificially increase the number of symbols per block so going to larger blocks so it\u0027s a trick it\u0027s tricky it is described in the IFC describing raptor but you have to do that so the experimental setup is similar to what I presented just before so you are this CDR transmission channel which makes sense for the use case that we are continuing with free DPP we are considering constant bit rate transmissions so in this case you have 10 packets per sorry a 1 red packets per second constant bit rate transmissions you are this target quality we don\u0027t want to have more than 1/10 of the power minus 3 packets missing after FEC decoding so that target correctly we have this lost model which is also a very important parameter and then we have this latency budget the amount of time you can afford to doing encoding decoding operations and in that case we consider two types or two values quarter second and a second and then we want to measure in the first set how much repair traffic we need to achieve this given target quality tennis - free after I specifically given a loss model given yes give Ross model given the targets the FEC latency budget so what is the additional "
