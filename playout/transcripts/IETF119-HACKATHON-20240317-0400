We have currently and which is the most important one, In this young Kafka data mesh architecture, we have a schema registrates that's connecting the data They're the collector, and they're data consumers to preserve the young schemas the young semantics so that it can be accessible for both parties And And to do that, we need the entire young dependency because the warehouse schema works similar to how the dependency works it's pointing to the other schemas that it has is having relationship with, too. And, And, therefore, we need to get not only the Yamalog, but also the Yamologids young dependencies more due in order to form such as schema registry, and that's the background. And, we week before, we have other solution for doing this and first one is the ghetto schema, and we have forced to pass the first message, but they all they both are not very not very ideal for, the current state real time to inject ingestion background because the first one is way to time consuming, and the second one has missing dependencies. Possibility. And therefore, in this hackathon plants, we have implement this feature so that people could all try to run this. And and this is our demo.

That's one example of the different Seebel For serialization, there's also variations for integers floating point numbers, strings, maps, and arrays. So some use cases determine, require determinant determinism. So next slide, please. So there's 2 drafts. That are in the works here. One is seabor CDE, or seaborne deterministic encoding. Which is a more formal def definition of, deterministic format that was mentioned in Rfc8949. It gives rules such that the same input data produces So that's one, new addition. Another is DC board, which, is layered on top of, CDE. Additionally, it unifies, the number serial is across integers and floating point and also allows some seaboard construct constructs. They're particularly those that are not supported by Jason. It also requires a non conforming rejection on conforming, seawater in the decoder. Next slide. So the hackathon project was, an implementation of these two drafts in QC War. It's not main lined yet, but, we got a west and most of it's working.

For the ex, for the encapsulation delay, ingress note, the detached shows left here, and for Kilo and the forward delay on Transinost, the data shows in table and 3.

So in actual network environment, the improvement can be considered to have little influence And, for the ability test, we are total of 5000 packets were sent and the difference between the descending interval and the receiving interval was calculated. And on the right, we set a value to further measure stability. So both simulation results indicate that when the long time loan delay link is involved there are 2 elements of the interval between standard time and the recipient time risk.

It's a little bit cross area between the routing area and the security area. So anyone who's familiar with the path validation. It's, to arrive, to work with that. The problem statement is that, traditional routing security only guarantees the correct reachability. And does not guarantee someone more. Advanced security, like, predictability of, affording behaviors of the device And when it goes wrong, it does not have kind of a audit ability. The motivation is that some security sensitive clients of the operation, our operators. For example, like, the financial institutions, they want their sensitive data to forward only via trusted devices. And, they want to they want their data to only stay on this trusted line and does not want deviation from this and, hence made you know, lead to did a leakage. And the solution we have here is we want to reuse the IOTF work, the rats working group for those who might be interested in rest is that, provides a way to create a trustworthiness of a device of a single point by remote testing it. And then what we are going to do is that we orchestrate, we kind of spend this single point of trusting to a path level trust by connecting them. So we hear we orchestrate a path that consists only of trusted devices, trust operation. Environments and trusted services. And then we connect them by, we designing a dedicated packet like a dial dial test. A colleagues and favors this path and it collects all these security station results.

I'll start by saying that this is work that's sort of split between IETF and NIST were in some weird way cooperating under the NIST NCC OE migration to post photography project. There's a strong amount of cross referencing going on here. This group has been running as a hackathon group since I TF1 seen we've been running interim hackathons, between the official hackathons. We run a monthly 1 hour meeting. So this is really a quite active Hackedathon Group were building up quite a robust repository of test artifacts. We're working on a large number of drafts. I think there's a dozen listed here, and there may be more that people at the table have worked at that I'm not aware of this weekend. Basically, it covers anything post quantum with anything certificates. Including migration mechanisms, therefore. So what what got done specifically this weekend? So since the last IETF, we have we've been working to put in the new new implementations of the NIST primitives, MLDSA, MLS, slhdsa, that should be, and mlchem. From Dialithium Sphinx Plus and Kyber, the the the slight changes there, up to 4 unique and algorithm implementations very open source implementations. We've got test artifact formats that have been evolving We've added CMS based, artifacts to test the encryption primitives you need content to encrypt in order to test the encryption parameters.

And we split up into 2 different groups, I suppose. Because only half of us wanted to work in Pearl, and the other half would rather use rust So I'll present first for the the Pell side, which was not me, perhaps some notes here. So they were working on, RPKI RTR. So Up Ki is resource public key. Infrastructure, the resource there is for IP numbers, autonomous system numbers, that kind of thing. And RTR is protocol for raters to receive Information from RPKI validators and then they use that to decide which routes that they actually Accept or reject. As part of their routing table, so for Altia, there are 3 versions the 0 version 0, version 1, and the 3rd version version 2, which is still in draft status. So The work today And yesterday, has been on Appell's ever in client, We added support for urgent validation, And version 0 support because there was already version 1 and 2. Vision negotiation support because were some recent developments on this. Plant recovery from service side data loss"

Next steps, I will be even more, interrupt testing, client support for multiple servers, and being able to merge multiple AS as per objects together. As for being one of the the new parts that's most interesting from version 2 which we used to validate AS Poths, And there'll be some issues to report back to the working group found from working with the draft. On the rest side, we implemented AS path verification, based on Esper, which comes from a draft there. We did that as a proof of concept. We found the logic was easy to implement. Using the draft text as a reference. And we'll formalize some feedback to give back his improvements to the draft text we tested our implementation against multiple scenarios. To validate correctness as far as we can tell, it was going very well. But the code for that is not public yet. I did a a a quick fun project with this where we use the lever to pull real Aspus from Ravenator. And we pulled SAS pause from one of the ripe risk collectors, and we Did a big, validation on everything using the downstream algorithm we found lots of valid paths, only a few invalid powers and the rest is all unknown because we only had 52aspers to test with which isn't that many. Anyway, thank you all for your time. That's what we got. It Thank you for the overview of your results. Very nice."

You, I I apologize in advance. For all the color you're about to see. Happy Saint Patrick's Day. So, this is a part of the V Con effort It's a meta hackathon problem So what we did this time was make a fake generation conversation generator, So, basically, the problem is that in a week, we're having another hack on for Vcons. We've got a couple dozen people working on them and the the The thing on this hackathon is to identify and redact personal information and conversations using the V Con format. The problem with that is we need to actually have conversations to have personal information in them to give to the participants that aren't actually you know, PII. So that's what we did today. So, you're familiar with Vcons really quickly, they carry conversations across networks. You can keep the data safe, and you can have a Nice set of tool a toolkit to guarantee the integrity, have data minimization, really, you know, treat that data. Right? So and you also also see here that there's a bunch of places inside the vicon where personal information might hide, not just the parties, not the transcripts, but maybe even inside the media of the conversations that's been in the court So, the plan was pick some fake names, and then pick a random business so we get"

So we've got, you know, a hundred people being angry at the bike store for not paying them right. Okay? And so after we made that transcript, we, We got a TTS engine, make an mpeg file, of that conversation, we use OpenAI, it sounded great. And then we use that we use that to make the v con and upload it to s 3. Long story short, it worked. So here's one of our screenshots of that conversation. And, so the features are it can can generate this fake conversation really quickly. It uses a Text to Speech engine. And generates these Vecon files that we can use for testing and analysis. One last thing you can do. So the generator for the Vcons is up in, the vcon directory. We can put that up in the IETF, get up as well. And the fake beacons we generated are also up there for your hacking privileges. And then finally, as we were sitting here, we put the actual location itself on streamlet so you can make your own fake Vcons at your own desk Monday if you want. Some some some some That's it. Thanks so much. you. Thank Complex, So, alright. DNS up. And after the DNS presentation, there will be the intense based network management, presentation. Okay. Did you go?

First thing is, compact denial of existence for It sounds very philosophical, and is actually quite philosophical. It means, so It's quite hard to prove that the name does not exist in the it leads needs a lot of signatures, and this is a sort of trick to say yeah, the name exists. Just not the type that you are for And in the insects saying that is, a type saying The name does not exist, the an explained time. And, yeah, so It's 2 authoritative, name servers, have been equipped with this new, protocol, the ADNS Server, and the drink server, The Ediness survey is written in Python from Schumann and drink is from day for more words, my and they said she Compact denial of existence is simple to implement. There's no problem. Straightforward. Archive restoration, that's that's if the result returns the, non existent domain to disturb his offer, it said resets the archive to an explained that's also straightforward. There are a few questions or suggestions to the draft came up while, working on this sir. Heck, One of them is if there's a direct treaty for the MX name. The name does not exist."

And this is based on on several active drafts. We we have the core thing in in what we're doing is that we have a proposal for how to locate where to send the update, regardless of whether the update is a notification or a dynamic update or API call or whatever. Yeah. We, we, we banged on a lot of bits in, an authoritative name server. We implemented stuff. And we have things that are sort of partially working. The the most of the difficult stuff is done, but we don't have a really working set up yet. So it getting closer, but it's not we've learned a lot, in particular, we've learned a lot of We what what is one of the the things we haven't solved before, which is how bootstrap downtime case.

The one is the officer working group we submitted the the individual rep, the 2nd 1, the MRG, And the third one is content, individual. So we tried to consolidate this one or intents based that's for management. So what we achieved this time. So we learned the main concept of, on free privacy. For our privacy network. And, also, we learned how to set up computation for internal based network, and security configuration. So based on this one, we, implement and test test data. You can be this link, we can show the video clip also, this is opens as a project. So you can access this GitHub a conclusion, we set up, basic, network configuration, but next time, 1 on 1, 2, 120.
