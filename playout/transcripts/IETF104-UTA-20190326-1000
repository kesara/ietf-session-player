    "text": "the loot that group and the background is to following a while ago years ago I was working with Thomas for sáááty and and others in the dice working group to define a profile for TLS and DTLS 1.2 for use in IOT environments and it as you know TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3 I wanted to there were lots of extensions and some of them if you use them incorrectly they didn\u0027t lead them to the desired results and also for IOT there were some additional extensions so the document outlined what to do in the specific cases now we are 1.3 and of course 1.3 is a much better protocol in terms of security and performance and everything however it leaves two aspects to profiles namely one is one is the choice of algorithms it makes an default algorithm choice which is great for the web and the other thing is it also requires a profile that describes on what protocol you application protocol you use TLS and DTLS 103 with for use of the zero RDD functionality and guys have worked in on such a profile for HTTP usage I think that\u0027s whatever group doesn\u0027t matter and in this document I\u0027m actually putting those two functions in India currently there\u0027s not much else besides that ambition in the future as we gain more experience with implementations in the IOT field will provide additionally some guidance on how to use certain features in an IOT context to provide better flash optimization over the over the air band production are also sort of to lower RAM usage so that\u0027s that that\u0027s the purpose of the document that\u0027s why I submitted it to this group the dice group doesn\u0027t exist anymore otherwise I would have sent it here but I think this group is it\u0027s also good for that purpose because there was this prior work on the best current practices for TLS 1.2 and the algorithms that came along with it so I think if it fits nicely in here although the IAD communities and yet here but I think there can be trust sort of working group postings so so that\u0027s that was the intention and are you looking for this to be a working document yeah that would be nice and to find some reviewers in this in this group or in other in general some reviewers I can obviously target some individuals who are know who are working "

    "text": "on this with so we\u0027re currently wrapping up DTLS 1.3 and sort of TLS as you know 1.3 has been finalized but it\u0027s still its usage in an iud environment is still early days because it takes a little bit longer to write these embedded it somewhat optimized stacks so I expect this document to stick around for maybe a little long it\u0027s even though it\u0027s simple I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anywhere near to completion yet so can I check who is anybody in the room read it hands up who\u0027s read this document right one problem I mean we might have is that sort of the people in this room or typically expect to see these things related to tui maker entree because that\u0027s sort of what the work where the working group is now I think in order to like make us successful like import of this document we got to have like the the right reviewers and the right people in the room so I think what would help is if you could help us find reviewers who could actually turn up on the on the mailing list saying yeah we read it looks interesting we wanted adopted us working group document right because that actually gives us sort of the the recent like push on this all right excellent review review volunteer from very excellent thank you and Alexei you know this is up to the chairs to decide how you want you know when and if you want to adopt the document and the process you want to use but are you looking for yours first on the mailing list yeah I think so I think I mean clearly this is all clearly but is this is sort of in scope for the for the work yeah I think it\u0027s fine shorter eyes but try to brought people and you know I I think I want I think it\u0027s a good idea for working to know that it can complete the work before like taking on something and like having like a couple of people have reviewed something indicates a level of interest that actually makes it likely that we can do this there\u0027s a second reviewer in the Java room look on attend all right if we if you guys can review the volunteers review and also send send an email to the listing as I\u0027ve reviewed this document it looks crappy fine good bad whatever right just anything is good it\u0027s a short document you can cross post oh yeah you know yeah we\u0027ll talk to nice yeah it\u0027s very meaningless well you know if you want to comment on this news comes here and I and I think compare this with the one that to version it\u0027s obviously very short and I think that\u0027s a good thing "
