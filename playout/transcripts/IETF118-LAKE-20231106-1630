You got it. Okay. Welcome, everyone. This is the Lake working group session at that IT 118. We have note takers who kindly volunteered. I thank, Marco and Giovanni for agreeing to take notes. And Steven will help us out as the JabberScribe. So, We have a 1 hour meeting and the agenda is quite packed So, I propose we get started immediately? So this is an IETF meeting. So please be aware of the note. Well, it describes the various IETF policies that, on the standardization process in the IETF and the contribution. Also, we didn't have any problems with, inconsistent behavior in, in the working group. So I'll just skip this slide, but, otherwise, please behave. So for the newcomers among us, please make sure to sign into the session using the MITTech collite client. Or your laptop, and use the Mitako to join the mic queue, and please keep audio and video off if not using the on-site for we don't have too many, on, remote participants, but that I see. I think most of the folks are here. So but in case also same guidelines follow for the remote disciplines. Please join the queue and we, before speaking."

So on the this is a status update. So The ad hoc draft has been, shipped approved by the ISG on 28 August 2023. It is currently in the RFC edit queue. There has been a little setback, but we will be discussing this during the ad hoc's, ad hoc updateslot. Same thing for the draft traces, it was approved by the ISG on 22nd September. It is currently in the other RFC editor queue, and it was held back temporarily because of the setback with ad hoc. We have adopted, draft Lake odds, the 00 version on 18th October. And we will be hearing this time, some implementer feedback some first implemented feedback on this draft. And other than that, we had 2 or if I count to differently, 3 independent 00 that we'll be discussing in this meeting So three is because the one of the drafts was submitted as a court draft and I think it relates very much too late, and we will be discussing it in this meeting as well. So the proposed agenda is, as follows. So we will first be starting with the trusted items, with the adopted items. I'm sorry. The ad hoc, short updates on the ad hoc and the traces drop, the implemented feedback up on the odds draft. And then we will start with the independent, with independent submissions that are led by Marco and Christian. Does anyone want to bash this agenda?"

So as, Adesh already told us, this is essentially shipped, but, there's been some changes since the last meeting So next slide, please. So there are 2 new versions of ad hoc 3 new versions of traces. And, in version 21 of network, we essentially to the the, IST comments And there was some minor update also in in version 22. Which was approved and sent to the RC editor. And, yeah, I I have a separate slide on the Ana discussion. So if you were blinking last week, you might have noticed that missed that we actually moved from RFC editor state back to IST state and now in RFCs together through again. The traces, 0 6 was essentially capturing the ISG comments. We added some invalid traces. I'm gonna talk more about that. In section 7. And, in version 7, sorry, and then there's minor update which was sent to to the RFC editor. So These are essentially the comments from"

There is a change in use of English It's not necessarily it's not a requirement. It's more recommendation. There were a lot of quick comments about transport requirements, and We try to capture those. And then the rest related to security considerations there is now some more text about symmetric crypto and the implications, post quantum implications, There is And the it used to be a recommendation about threat model, which is now changed from a capital should to lower case should there's some clarifications on denial of service, mitigations and their limitations, and the level shuffling of text between sections. These were the changes in of 21, next slide, also minor update where we finally added the recommendation dot transport. Again, coming from ISTs. Review. And then we bring on to the Next slide traces. No. Sorry. Okay. So this was set up 22. And then that was shipped to the RFC editor and It's back again at the RC editors. You don't need to read this slide.

A CNF claim containing a KOSA key. So it's essentially credential of some sort.

So thanks to also to the earlier to got in a huddle on Sunday, I think, as well, just to make sure this was all good. Thank you. Next slide. Oh, the and then we had the traces document. So we did, major updates in version 6. Which was aligned with It was a minor change to a specification, but all the test vectors had to be had to be re recalculated. That was a large work by Marco mainly. And then there were, follow-up within drop tests between 3 different implementations, Both, test vectors are now verified by 2. Independent implementations. And we have added malicious as a co author. So now all implement implementers are authors of this draft. All implementers involved in the interrupt test.

And so it's kind of easy to detect whether you have a a compliant CtdL or not, and there are some cases where you might make mistakes. So so that's included. Then there is a second subsection looking at crypto related errors. If you have the wrong length of Mac or if you are not doing the point validation or Yeah.

But according to the termistic seabore, you are supposed to order them in electocratic border. So that is a nonissue from an from an end point of view, but it's it's actually non determinist ex vivo.

The device we will authenticate with the domain authenticator using ad hoc and Yeah. And then between device, between UNV, have a constraint in network. But between D and W, the network, is generally not constrained. Next slide, please And, the thing is that we can use the EAD feud from ad hoc to to to perform this, authorization. So we are basically leveraging the extensibility capabilities of ad hoc. So in message 1, we have the devices sending the location of W so that, we can forwarded the request, which will be a voucher request. Then for the response, the the voucher will be relayed back to you. Thanks, We are doing this on top of an existing implementation. Which is adhocrest It's a microcontroller microcontroller optimized it implementation of attacking wrists, yeah. It doesn't use heap. We do inline c bar encoding. So that we we don't depend on on external libraries. Have an effort to form a verification in this implementation. Which is going on.

Which is basically an optimization where we can just, act as a relay of, incoming messages, and then w will decide if this message should be allow it or not, or that this device should be allowed or not. So we support that. We also made a change so that he messaged you we send credit v by value. Which, in ad hoc, normally, it's by reference, especially when we cons consider constrained networks. We also have a market w that for now runs alongside the And we We we plan to to make I mean, I mean, for to do, we have, implementing W, have the whole, authenticated communication between VW we plan to do a demo. Also as next Next slide, please. So beginning with the actual feedback here, So I start, with a message too, where we have cred cred v transported by value. So when we look into the ad hoc specification, in many cases, We have all that the I the cred the I ID cred either of initiate or responder is centered by a reference. This is to reduce the overhead on the master size. It requires pre provisioning of credentials in I and R, which is Fine. Like, we it's like an optimization. That can be done to to save, bytes over the network. When we are trying to do this authorization procedure where we want"

And so the comment here is that while the draft, addresses that credit fee can be sent over the air that is stated. Several times in the document. I think that there could be a more directed guidance that, for example, I proposed that the implementation should support sending credentials by value. Because, think that could be more upfront in the document because in this in in our implementation specifically, that was a significant change so that we could support these 2 modes of operations. And, also, I think it would be valuable to add considerations on increasing message sizes which for a wrap up cookie will be between like, be somewhere around 60 90abytes. Next slide, please. Next, I I continue talking about message 2. And, speak about, the processing and with respect to credit credit fee, where the responder, which is V sends back the credential to the initiator. So First, we go we we make a step back to to think about the voucher because the voucher is admitted by w And, It's it is calculated by doing a hockey spent, which is basically a Mac over the parameters of the BRK, info, English, And the important thing is here is that, info contains the credential of the So what we have here in the end is the a transitional, Trust because since you trust w, in the end, you will trust the credential of v."

Next slide, please. This is more editorial. Where there is the definition of calculating the MAC. And I mean, calculating, So sometimes where they We have the function a doc expand called, where we have length, I I hear I denote length star and length, length, length, length two stars where only it went two stars is actually, really define it. The other one can be inferred by the size of the initialization vector but that could be stated, explicitly. So that's one thing I noticed while implementing Next slide, please. And here two questions that are related to the processing of message 3 The first one is with respect to EAD handling. Where, we can divide from the implementation point of view, we have car ad hoc handling and the handler of the EAD. And But I think that it may be the case that in receiving message 3, we want to trigger the EAD handling after message 3. But from an implementation point of view,"

Should we have an Eighty 3? That can be addressed, and, further discussion. And the next point is processing of ID credentials. Which is normally, transport as a reference from the device to the Domino's indicator. So just to state, this fits in the trust model of trusting first use that probably we'll mention with, his draft of the implementation guidelines. And But what we have here is that since w dresses you. The device, then V also trust W and this should be able to trust you So there is, again, this kind of transitive, trust but the voucher is not bound to the credential of you. So It's not very clear to V if he can trust on the credential of you So the question is, should it have such a binding or what can we do about it? Or it really a problem? So I think it's worth discussing Next slide, please. And those final remarks, I found during the implementation that, the ADOC AD mechanism actually works well for extensibility. Also the reuse of the primitives of ad hoc. It helps because in the same code base, it was possible to reuse, the and lock expand functions, for example, So there are some proposed clarifications to the draft. Some questions that we can discuss about message 3. And for next steps, we plan to do that demo. And, interpretability, testing would be also very nice. And for this, we need, the implementation of Adobe. Where we talked it, to"

So if you, yeah, Jerasinon. I think thank you very much for for this careful reading, and I think that that clarification so we can make makes a lot of sense. In regards to your questions, I think that's, that's really good input about for example, the EAD3 there is that So currently, there is there is only, EAD items for for message 1 and message 2. Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, the way EADs are defined, it's basically application a given application can use the ADs in, in any message. So if we need to have them, for triggering certain actions, then then, yes, we should put them, put them in there. And that probably makes sense in in, And, yeah, that's your proposed here. Where what about the and about the binding That's actually, I think we haven't really solved yet. It's been it's been discussed, but we don't have a a solution to that. So that's, something to put on the issue tracker, I think, don't have a straight answer very good comments. Thank you very much. K. Thank you. Okay. Christian, I'm so sorry for not joining the Q multiple device for you. So on on the E83 state, I think it should be fine to pass that around in the application. Because the application will know that it is doing, an off exchange, and it will still know that by the time it is processing message 3. As for the the second part, I mean, yes, I think, well, I think, well, I think, well, I think, well, I think, well, I think, well, I think, I do think kind of"

So we're like, we're like not completely out in the in we're we're not completely, on in TOFA Moon. Okay. Yes. I can I can discuss that? So I have one question for you, and I think one one of them. So the question is you mentioned the working on looking at hacks Yes. If I remember correctly, so that's like an annotated code. Approach or not? No. No. We in the beginning, it was very restrictive for what kind of rest we could write. And Malaysia did a lot of work, with that. But now we have been increasingly being able to write more regular risk because they are evolving on their side. So Frank. Oh, this week, we all supported regular stretch instead of just some special kind of stretch that is more constrated. Okay. So so they could be if you saw this, if if if you're able to send them mail to the list about the status of And, you know, if they're not necessary today, but whenever whenever They're switching residents. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would be good to know. And then the other question is maybe more for the authors. What's the like the one sentence description of how how finished this work is? It's not finished. But, you know, it's progressing. So, yeah, You're on. I'm thinking. This has been around for a long time. And we discussed it a lot, but I mean, Yevana is doing is providing us with good questions here, which means that we haven't thought about some things. So Yeah.

This should only be a surprises just finally a draft, but his content has been also presented in the past. Next slide, please. So, yeah, to recap during the the work on the actual logs, specification, there were, a number non trigger things that kept coming up. It was a right on the side to keep them, away from the specification of the core document. But still acknowledging that they were relevant to. At some point, documents on how to, help implementers to, make mistake or waste time. I think over and over the same things, they're just inevitable points. 1, to consider at some point when implementing either an application using it or or another Calabrio here, whatever. So it's really about the implement or, guidelines. I presented this at different level, also in previous meetings, interim meetings, that also contributed in originated, text on the chart at the time. Quoting here. Next slide, please. And, yeah, we finally have the document, it is still about the, three main topics that I imagine from the start organized into, one section, each.

Application or another library to take, in case of Learning new authentication credentials on the fly, we're running, ADOC. So it's not about already stored and will trust this credential. It's about new one appearing. On the fly. And the 3rd and most interesting one that apparently was considered already during the Hakadan would just head is about, a number of site processing steps that are taken, especially about validation of credentials and processing of yearly items that are, of course, in interest of weather, but, shouldn't be something the actual log protocol. Should worry about, should actually be agnostic. Of those aspects. Next slide, please. Yeah. On the on the first topic, there is mainly, only the the application that has full awareness and visibility of the the ad hoc sessions, the are ongoing or are completed and, of the key material that, got their eye from them. I started to imagine a number of things that can happen and the easiest thing also to handle is really, an adaptation has to be, worst. Just because it has become invalid, for example, because the credentials involved there, has been revoked. Owned expired. But this is just simple. Just first the session and destroy the keys, you're done if you want to run a new session. It's a bit more tricky case. The session remains valid, but, for some reason, the the keys that were exported are not good anymore for a number of reasons, really. And then there's a caveat. You need to check if those keys have been actually persisted, meaning, used the actually a discussion about that in the end of document itself. So that's not the case. Well, the keys have haven't really been used and persistent really. So, crush them, right, back again. But the keys were, used and you may try something better running it off again altogether, like,"

And then there's a third case, which is basically variant of second one where, not only adaptations and keys are involved, but also something else like an access token, access rights that possibly was, a first enabler, to run, to run a doc in the first place, And, you need to check that the access token is also still valid otherwise before taking any other any other action in the same lines of case 2, you need to the new access token first and a case in point is, a profile for the ace framework based on got endoscopy. Next slide, please. And this is the second topic, on the models for the authentication credentials. And, again, if a credential is stored, is trusted, since the story happened and of course, this is going to be the case as long as the credential is not regork doesn't expire. So this is more about what to do, when the peer receives a credential during end of execution and it has to decide if it's taking it or not, of course, assuming it is valid. Whatever validate in the credential means, for example, very fine exchange of signatures for a certificate. I've always seen this, 3 rough, trust models where where the first one is the absolutely most strict one. I'm not fine with learning anything on the fly, basically. I want to have the credential already stored So if you come to me with the credential by valuing the message, well, I validate it I take it in my head already.

But, I have, for example, the hash that certificate that I stored, and I, I received in advance by, some trust party. And the third one, I call it tofu yet. Is the sputable if the name is appropriate for for definition that I have in mind, but it's really, I'm fine with learning anything you want to fly as long as is valid of course. You're right. A quick comment. So we had a question from from Johanna previously about the old stretch. So, so this is really more learn on 1st use rather than trust and 1st use. So you, you have, you get the credit V your message too, and you also get the voucher, then you can use the voucher to verify credibly. We ended up talking about that where the peer didn't have anything at all. Already stored about the credential And then the desired behavior was, well, if the credential received now by value, valid I'm okay with that. I store it. And we realized validating the voucher was essentially step, in order to validate the credential was a bit was all about what it is in the credential and invalid was fine to learn in a store. So that was kind of mapping in what I thought as tofu here. Because the peer wasn't storing anything in advance, really.

Calling that trust on first use it it it might fit with trust and first use, but it doesn't fit with always trust and unknown cred. Because that's not that verification adds more than just trusting the credibility as it comes. In my mind. It can be seen also as case to you if, have sent a definition to admit not only identify use of that credential, but also credential of further parties used for the validation. I I was mapping that of case 3 so far. Okay. I'll come down in the queue. Certain Thanks. I I I failed. I don't really see how 1 and 2 would be, like, different kinds of the trust levels. This seems to be different ways you can build your applications, but they should have identical security while while tree has a different completely completely different trust model.

And next then, I'll try to rush a bit. Yeah, this is the most interesting part, I think, that we also consider closely the hackathon is just to reiterate that the the processing of an incoming ad hoc message for message 23 is not exactly linear. Part of it in the blue box is really core at the processing, but there two two parts of that where you really have to divert out of of the core of the processing, entering what I imagined as a processor object ambient. And that happens, right after the description of the message, for processing some ED items that you can already get that point for valid the credential and the few things may have to go, hand in hand just for the case we have just seen. That you get back to it up for verifying the message in the signature or the MAC and then in principle, you divert it again, for example, to process, yeah, the items that can be processed only at that point, And, in either case, you may have to produce eAD items to include in the next, outgoing epic message. This figure is not in the draft. Happen to be, useful together with another one that I have in an offline slide. I promise to include figures as ASCII art and expression of the draft. So, Marco, just as a timing check, you're you're eating into the next presenter's time, but that's you. Yes, sir. So Up to you. How you how you do that? Next is just a summary. Thanks for the feedback. We were some plan to add, a bit more comment anyway, I'd appreciate especially feedback. And if any, Big topic is missing here."

So with my chair head off, I would just like to comment we found that we carefully, referred to this document during the hackathon and and helps us in implementation of in complementing the implementation of the our implementation of ad hoc with a genetic handling of EAD items. It was very helpful. So and then So this is kind of this maps to a a chartered milestone. So I guess it's we asking for adoption now, or what what do we wanna that now, or do you wanna do that later, or I was personally planning for next revision only to add those lines there, which are relatively minor. I don't have in mind any major additional rest of the call me myself, So let's maybe see first how many people have read this draft can you raise your hands? Okay. Not Maddie. So Okay. Okay. So it sounds like maybe if you wanna do those updates, and then we can see if we get feedback on the list and do a call for adoption. The mean, it seems like a useful thing, so I don't I don't expect that to be controversial, but we should do the call. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Mark, you're up next slide. Yes. Is running the draft on adult application process coordination. Next slide is Right. So as a quick recap, adoprolizer number of parameters for a successful execution of have be, to some extent, the grading events between the two periods, some of those can be can be also negotiated, inbound, but at a high level, if you set to agree on, application profile to consider, for running a doc specifying,"

This also contributes to shaping what I'm quoting here as part of the charter, accessible. This topic And, well, this document is off to the starting point. Next slide, please. Okay. And while working on this, we came up with this 4 different, points that built kind of incrementally. So we started with the the definition of, an identifier that can be assigned to an application profile, to be referred to in different environments. To indicate what application profiles are supported, or used, for example, And the second point is, yeah, examples of, where those identifiers can be practically used, and we have 2 already. As a third one, we came up with a possible a canonical representation, a seaborne of an up a profile in the interest of, well, distributing fetching, storing, a description of the profile. And then that's also part of the sentence the charter, the, the definition of 1 or more, will known application profiles, and the meaning of this is not 100% clear at the moment, by the way. Next slide, please. So the first part is really simple. It boils down to a registry where we can expect to have, integer identifiers possibly with the rent, registration policies and, a pointer to the specification that defines, the profile, then I don't know if one or more well known professors can come already. For the from this document, for example, and Next slide, please. So assuming that a registry existing and a few identifiers that can be picked up from there with"

And this, the, the first one, they to our mind, actually, And I think the trigger was, a set of, comments from Christian who are working group plus call, in a core document. Where this sort of ideas that this possible means came up, we stopped considering I mean, in that document because, it was more general than that and more appropriate here. Somehow. As a possible use assuming, you have that registry populated with some verify your, here you have an example where you can query the well, noncore resource, over co ops server, for example, you can get back links, at that server of other resources. And, and we have in the example, 2 other resources. One where, the resource is spilling out, almost 1 by 1 it's a aspect of a lot of these supports with the related value and those attributes are already existing as defined in the core document, I I talked about. This example is also I think, and alternative be, for the link to another and or resource where where you just say, with this identifier, 500 say that, well, that resource supports whatever, the profile 500 says. Next slide, please. Staying in this example, we wanted to keep things quite simple, and we we gave, well, a normative guidance in the document at the moment says, basically, don't mix approach a and b in the same link, meaning either you go for spelling out different things. Like for doing a, or, you indicate, a profile with the identifier, but not both things. So that's where we are right now. It can be just fine. We just wondered if, it's worth admitting an exception to this for specifying in the same link, both the identifier of the application profile and the list of supported EAD items just to avoid the potential, explosion of registration of so many application profiles that I"

Feedback is welcome. Next slide, please. Yeah. But another example of use, of these, application profiles is you know, the script object data information object, defined in an ace draft. Where basically this sort of object can be used in different situation to describe, support, by a certain adult peer, of the functionalities and parameters, the draft is already find the object, it's possible used in that context. This document is defining some possible additional entries. And in particular, one that I've highlighted in red where you can specify, the integer identifying, the profile. We didn't want to mess up with deadline ends on, but, while session 30 is generic and fits will hear, I think, on extending that object. Section 31, is definitely belonging to the other document in Ace because it it scribes how to use, these additional parameters there. So it's in this document for now, but the plan is definitely to move it out and to that desktop where, we believe it actually, belongs. Next slide, please. And on the third topic with thought it would be useful to have a canonical representation of network application profiles to be, distributed, fetched from, trusted source, stored, and some with with auto seabor. And we would like to reuse the same names for this to to say and code points from the same registry, if I in the ace document that I mentioned before.

And this has no intention to deviate from what is mandatory to implement, and so on. Okay. Next slide, please. Yeah, I I don't have clear myself, really, what what what what an application profile. Must say, can say in general how an exhaustive catalog, should look like. So I will complete back on what's that that list of possible attribute, should cover but I noticed that the yet of document, already suggested that an application profile is supposed to tell a number of things, like the types of end point identifiers, and the transports to use, for Red Oak. So it's clear the software information should be around I don't have clear how it should be represented. And I just raised some open questions here. So we don't have to answer to them now. But at some point in that particular data item or more in general with understand how we want to represent these 2 particular pieces of information, and and if we are missing anything. In general. Next slide, please. Which is the last point, Yeah. This is an opportunity to consider the definition of 1 or more, I don't know, when nonprofiles and in case that can be registered in in the, profit identifier registry, we're proposing here.

So, yeah, I'd like to introduce the draft to this working group. I filed it with core back before the re chartering. So and forgot to update the name going going for with the last iteration.

The answer that I wish I had back then was that, yes, I mean, some things, this will have for something, this will be good. And at any rate, a kind of long as we're mindful of what we take, we can also learn from the experience what worked well there. Thing that worked well there, is our 2, sorry, 1, providing Greece to, T, TLS attachment points. Next slide, please. What this what this means is that or what what the the trouble they ran into was that, as TLS extension points, we are not commonly used implementations and even middle boxes. Started relying on the absence of options there. So, they provided a few options and let's do that as as well. So at her, it has its has its extension points being EAD items, being surface weights, and others. So let's make sure that they can be used by making sure that occasionally there is traffic that contains them. Next slide, please. The concrete thing that the draft currently does is that it registers churs, a few EAD items, one in the in the 1+1 range that is like between 2 between 24456. And 2 in the range where you would have, 16 bit integer. That are all, that that are only used in the optional So then the EID item can be mandatory to understand or optional to understand and the way this would be used as optional to understand. So an implementation that provides freeze in a message. We'll add these options. And there is no action to be taken when they are received and by being optional. That means that, good implementation. That is a non broken implementation. We'll just ignore them. And similar to the Cypher suites."

And the requirement, there is just that the responder will never select them. So responder that doesn't know this document will do this automatically and the responder that does do this will please not do this because it will be a very awkward one. Both say that, hey, let's do this and then they find out that, yeah, well, I actually can. So, so the semantics are always the same as with many Greece options. If you receive them, just ignore them, but as they are all authenticated, we'll make sure that the ad hoc will already make sure that no one in between is tampering with options. There are 2 more extension points in and in in ad hoc, that that are the methods and the cozy headers that are used. I don't think so They can't be extended to the same can decrease in the same way because when Greece would be applied, then the negotiation would fail. There are ideas of how they could be negotiated by the question is like sorry, of how they could be used to the questions should they, and my I'm generally leaning towards them. Next slide, please. So this is a list of, like, FAQs that I think would be raised at some point, one is that, like, we can't just add stuff because this makes our messages bigger and we want to have more messages. So yes, this won't be applicable to all connections, but the very constrained ones are those that are better managed anyway. On the general internet, I mean, there I hope that we'll see a lot of, echo connections that are, like, not that constrained, and we can just add a bit of that. Will be up to the application also. Another thing is that this can be a converged channel. So we had a common from the from the interview, on on padding"

So I think that's like yes, be aware of it, but there's nothing much that you can do there is one item that is, that when you do when you do add breeze, then you do this in the a particular pattern. So every 8 8th message or every 100 and the way you do this reveals something about the implementation you're using. If you're very careful, you might not want to do this. And this is why the graph contains a suggestion of a pattern how you would apply that based on, like, random input data. So you could hide in the largest possible, and anonymity set if everyone does this. Next slide please. So my next steps here are, a, there is, the user to lose it, RFC, but I'll still have to check for more guidance to pull out of there. There is, as I just found out today to my embarrassment, there is an, an IAB, action going on that is also working on a document that describes freezing in a more abstract way and provides good input that may or may not be applicable, like we'll see. So that is something that I'll still want to pull in there, but, yeah, this general, this should be an easy document. I mean, it's just a few options worth like, set them up with Trevali and ignore them when you receive them. So Yeah. I think this should be straightforward. The question is, is this the right place to do Thank you. Thanks. And I guess we don't really have time because we're just out but, let's let's raise this on the list and, see what feedback we get. Okay. So we already have an item in the charter, the corresponds to this work. So I guess this is the right place to work on this.
