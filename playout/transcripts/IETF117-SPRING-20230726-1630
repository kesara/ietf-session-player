So Is it really BFD is capable of reliably monitoring segment routing policy, or it something different. So that's what we looked at. and starting with the going back to the ROC 5880 that defines the BFD, And in abstract, it clarifies what BFT is monitoring. So it monitors the bidirectional path between 2 forwarding engines and to certain level the engines themselves. So it clearly points out that the monitored entities, they exist in the following plane between 2 systems. So then comparing and and just learning what SR policy definition is, So the And so our policy is is constructed of different types of segments. And instructions, there are topology all service based based So there understanding is that a SAR policy is a service instruction.

So when we talk about what BFT based mechanism, and it's not necessarily only BFD mechanism. based on 5880 as in Kronos or point to multipoint in 8562. But as well as any other BFT based mechanism. So that BFD based mechanism monitors a candidate bet. of a serpolicy. Further in updating the document, they following on suggestions that we received in the comments after previous presentation, we added a section that clarifies the applicability specifically of SBFD. and it seems reasonable to point out that SBFD mechanism because of its characteristic is applicable only to point to point. policies. or candidate pass. whereas their BFD with its 8562, can be applied to point to multipoint. or 8563 can use active tails So then it"

So if you go to the previous slide at one comment on that one, the actually, under a SR policy candidate path, we can have segment lists. And that we do load balancing between the segment list. So if we want to monitor the path, perhaps, we need to monitor on a per segmentless basis. Yes. You're right. Again, In my opinion, So if we have a ACMP environment within the segment routing. So, basically, it's not strict. It's strict to lose. Right? So then, yes, then each of the paths that compose their ECMP environment for the given candidate path itself presents a candidate path. then, basically, So ECMP environment creates a multiplicity of candidate paths. for the given SR.

Let's discuss the exact wording that what you envision. Okay. on on the next slide, you have mentioned about about about probability of detecting defects in IP network.

Actually, As one of their earlier proposals in these documents, So this document proposes non fact TOV, that can include their Segment list, as labels. to use for the reverse path.

Actually, that's questionable that it's possible because the I my understanding of SBFD is does not create a state on a remote system. Jeff, I was You're correct about that, Greg. Oh, I had Jeff. So Jeff I asked for the microphone. So, Greg, I think to your broader question about what is being protected. The candidate perhaps probably are what makes sense based on what I understand at the spring architecture. I One of the things that came through IDR, this most recent session was draft chin IDR, BGP, SR policy, CP validity, can see the agenda for it. I don't have strong opinions about that proposal at the moment, but it also raises a I've has a little bit of thinking for you that the candidate paths are being protected by BFD. And, really, what you're doing as part of using the candidate halves is you're providing it input for the candidate path validity procedure. And once you've decided things are valid or invalid, This means that the rest of the spring procedures for using these candidate paths then take no effect. So maybe that will help clarify your text.

So if you remember from stamp, we have a t one is a transmit, and t 2 is a receive on the forward path. timestamp and the reverse part. So there is a teach is the transmit and t 4 is a receive. time stamp on the re the reverse part. So it clocks asynchronized, the latency is t2-1. Otherwise, we have a a round trip delay and these are defined in RFct762, and then explain or elaborated for SR in the SRPM draft, and it defines another measurement mode look back measurement mode. And in in the new draft, we are doing some enhancement to that and we'll explain what that is. and next slide. So just to recap, what is the loopback mode for SR part, is basically the test packets are sent on SR part. and the reflector basically just forwards the packet like data traffic. So there is no stamp. Just packet processing is done. means there is no UDP monitoring inject of the packet. And there are use cases where this is quite useful where The reflector is is not capable of the time stamping and hardware or doing does not support the protocol.

So how do we do this with the SIV6 it's a new endpoint function that is carried with the locator seed of the reflector and it just triggers this behavior to collect the time stamp in fast data part. And the reverse part can be IP UDP, or it can be SR with 6, and it it would be encoded in the segment list if that is the case. So it's just fairly sim simple endpoint behavior that that's the trick. How do we do it for MPLS? So thanks to all the great work that was done by the MPLS working group. We adopted the M and A solution at the last IETF. we're use using that defining a new opcode So for for this behavior, and That's basically it.

That's the seed list. they can change the adjacencies, adjacent seed, of a failure load to the node receipt of the data remote node So you think I need to see allow me an introduction. I think we need to see a description on the list or in a draft of how you expect to address this then we need to continue the discussion on the list, please. Yeah. Good. That's good. Yeah. Andrew. Andres Don Nokia, just an editorial comment This there's a line that basically says distributing information about the binding cities out of scope. It's kind of nested quite deep, and it's a really fundamentally important aspect of this. So if we decide to keep it out of scope out of scope, that's okay. I just think it might be worth popping that up to a higher level on the draft kinda make it more visible for the working group. Thank you. It doesn't matter if I routing protocols, and therefore, it's probably appropriate that it's out of scope for this draft, but you can't solve it without it. Jeff, did you wanna add a comment, please. Yeah. Very quick. Just consider on video. I disagree with you. problem statement to begin with. And if we take your apology, you'll have a not protecting LFA, it's not but not link protecting. Right? Right?"

It complicates forwarding play, and there's no free lunch in fast pass. And the problem you are trying to solve is really corner case. So Yeah. I know the issue. Yeah. It's not a free lunch. We need to do something. Yes. But Okay. Okay. Sounds good, everyone. Pony. Europe, Last presentation, We're on schedule. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. And I'm Hong Yi from Huawei, and this time I want to advertise our job on SR based SFC control plan framework. and this is an information chart. Okay. Thanks. And and in this job, we will list or some control plan solutions for current SR based FSC implementation, and we categorize the implementations into status 1 that is and status in stated in SR. So programming, and there are also some stable ones that is is further divided into to subcategories and message based SFC with SR based transport tunnel and also SR based as see with integrated and a message service plan. Okay. And in okay. And in a control plan, there are and many true royalty information to distribute That's first is service function instant roads. last we collected from the nodes"

And, also, there is service function pass route Now we'll distribute it by the controller to to the to the switch nodes to show to and point out the path of service function like s service pass index and service index. to further direct the traffic to go through the certain SFC. next And And in this job, we mainly listed some current and existing control plan solutions, and we make where you compare reason. between lamb and in we now we can see there are 3 categories, status, and an s h base SFC that is similar to an s h and SR based, SFC, and which is to me not sure as latest one. So we can see that there are several ways to this view as f irandspr, Like, for status 1, we have BGP currently and PGP's ITP. And for asset PR, we see there are jobs that propose some solutions and, like, BGP and PCP. And, also, they can be used to to distribute steering policy. And for the other categories, we can see that's an edge based SFC usually adopt similar solutions to a message once. And so it use a PGP to this"

And for the last category, let's just as not based as of the And and it's similar to the status 1. So we have the almost the same solutions to the 1st categories. Yeah. Next. So and this time, I want to ask for some comments on this. job has involved into the bird's eye, and we have receive some suggestion and modify the dropped and And we we see that many jobs included in this kind of plan from what has and under maybe under go IV secure or has been a working group document. So we hope this control plan framework can be also move towards your working group. and and week And in this job, we can provide more information for those who want to deploy SFC Thank you. k. Any questions to the presenter? seeing nobody on the list. We get all get a few minutes of our lives back. Thank you very much for the engagement, really, shitted that. Sorry. We didn't have more time from more of the discussions, we'll see you on the list, please, where we have the best discussions. Cheng Lee, you wanted to say something. Go right ahead. Hello? Go right ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Tony from Huawei. I just want want to say that the I I think this work is useful, and and it it could it does have some, like, value. And and we do really hope somebody if you have any interest on this, please go to us. we can work on this together."
