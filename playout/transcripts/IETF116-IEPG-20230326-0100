If you need anything, I'll be back. I'll pop it in and now Yes. Thank you. I think I'm it's nice to print. Because I yeah. I did forget a counter of those are different meetings. Yeah. I know. One different. I feel like out. Yeah. Like, what is Yeah. Oh perfect. Okay. Good morning. Welcome to the best session of Atf meeting. The first and the best one, As you can see, I'm not warren. I probably poor substitute for him but do my best? Unfortunately, he could not be in this room today. He got Covid so And feel sorry for him, he is struck in the hotel room. So First... How can I presents? So up nox. So If you don't know what you're doing here, This is an Ip meeting. Which is informal resident We don't have a half variety idea of budget, but just yet, and we're normally talking about operational issues, or something related to operational issues, usually, it's happened to be Ip v six so dns s for rp, but I guess, today, we have few presentations on other topics as well. So I you now have to suffer just one more likely sounds."

Go what say So Actually, this is not up to date gender reindeer he will be presenting in the working group. I'm not here. So we have we don't have presentations about our Pic. Today. So we'll have two talks about extension headers. Great. Presentation about tele telemetry presentation about digital model and something about time. Time.

We've got some kind of interesting results So I wanted to thank some of the people who've been supporting us with both giving students to do the testing and and also financial support. Okay. Next, please. Okay. So I'm just gonna review where we were and then with the new debt. So I'll go through this new step the old stuff really quickly catch people up who may not have heard some of the other things. So so this is what we're doing is we're trying to figure out clear If extension headers can be used on the internet, And if not exactly what is the problem and why. And the I my motivation for this is that there's a particular extension header we would like to use. So... Okay. So next, please. So what we did we use the nineteen eighties kind of top, which is we're connecting directly into the internet without a cloud service or Cdn or anything like that and we put it in locations throughout the world so that we would be going across the core of the Internet. And how we did it is we modified the kernel to send an extension header with each packet. Okay. Next, please. And you can see we sent F ftp, the other thing we did, we said real data, not fake sc packets or anything like that next please? I said, this is all old stuff and you can see from doing the packet traces that you can see that we have not just our destination options, but fragment headers"

So then what we did, this is where we're now really getting into the new stuff. What we did now is we moved the server our server behind a Cdn. What we have is we have a client within Os that we've modified. We have a server with an Os that we've modified. They both will send x extension headers with every packet. So what you do is we just got a free thing from the Cd you know, free service, and we moved our web server behind a Cdn. So now what happens and it it's a little complicated So what you have to do Cdn of course, let's go to the next slide, you'll kinda see the top. Yeah. So what happens when you move behind a Cdn? Is this Cdn now is gonna do our Dns resolution. They also have like a bunch edge servers all over. So, you know, if you're in Mongol or, you're gonna go to the Bangalore You're not gonna go all the way to say on Jose. That's the idea. So you've got a clump of Internet on both sides. Internet from the client to the Cdn edge server, Internet from the Cdn edge server to the origin server. So there's two clumps of Internet that you could be going over. Next, please. So now this is the the the new stuff let's school. So why are we looking at Cdn so much because many of the"

And what we don't know. Okay. So next please. So the way that a lot of Cdn work is you can have either you you can say, you can just resolve my dns. And then if you if they just resolve Dns for you, you've got the standalone you know, service. They're not doing your edge proxy for you. That's one way. Of course, why anyone would pay a whole ton of money to have anyway. So probably you're not doing that. Alright. So you probably want the proxy functions. So but you can say this is the actual screen. Where you can say and we set up a bunch of different scenarios. Some q some, you know, just Ip so forth. So let's let's keep going... I'll show you what happens. Next, please? So what do we have? We have a client machine in Singapore. It's dual checked. It's got a v four address, and it's got a v six address. If we can do either curl or ping with it. And all of that is going to have and ip v six extension header attached to it. And then the server that we put behind a Cdn, it we put it in Newark and it's dual stacked also. And it's got it's... We we we did a bunch of different things. We put it on before only v six only and so forth. But we've got the the capacity to be able to change stuff around. K. Next, please. And these are our Dns definitions. And so you can see we have"

So of course, we can do packet traces at the same time. What we're seeing is we're seeing that we're sending the extension header and port eighty. Is answering, answering it even though the sin had the E. So it did resolve it went over there and the sin resolved Okay. So that means we got all the way behind to the Cdn. Let's see what else is going on next, please. Then we recall. That's that's doing Ip v four. I mean, I six. Okay. And so the source address here this is Singapore. We sent the the Tcp soon, and the desk address, it ends with zero one, and that is the Cdn. Address. So we are going to the Cdn edge cache. Our origin server ends with one five two seven. So we are being proxy. We're being proxy, so that's really good to know. Okay. Next, please. Because this is where it gets confusing too. Next So let's make sure and we we look up that address that the c the... The edge address, it is this indeed the Cdn. Okay. Next, please. So when we take a trace on the other side, The shocking thing of course is that we're seeing Ip v four. Ip four and we're like, good heavens. What's the problem? Okay?

That's an interesting thing. So let's go down And you can see from the forward packet that it was going on v six it got forwarded and then transferred over so that it was proxy over to v four. So, okay. So next, And and so So this is an important thing to know. If you have v four and v six Dns, it's going to prefer v four. Interesting. Let's let's go down. Next Yeah. So then we said, let's take out the Dns definitions. So we're gonna force it to go over v six. K? So let's see what happens. So we did the curl. Curl comes back this time. Alright. Let's see what the packets look like. Okay? Next, please. So from the client side, we can see that we are sending our extension header. It's not being blocked by the proxy but we're not getting extension headers back from the server even though it is defined to send extension headers back. Okay? So next, please? And on the server side, yes, this time we are getting v six, we are not seeing the extension headers though. So what is happening is if you do v six only, yes it goes v six, but you get nothing you get no extension header to the origin server. Next, please? And we are using the proxy function.

So what happens if you do v six only is that the extension had it works over to the Cdn edge. I mean, the packet is not dropped. But packets with extension headers do not go to the origin server. And this is true for all the cdn that we tested. This is actually as good as it gets for the Cdn. Some Cdn don't even if you do v six to the... If you do v only, they won't even work. So this is the best that Cdn can do at this point. They will go all the way through, but not to the origin server. But on one hand, you know, it is an interesting thing it to know. It's like if you can be sure, that it'll go up to this side, and then you know, it won't go to the other. I mean, that's at least something to know. And one of the things we're looking at is some of Cdn edge servers have an Api. They have like an Api gateway and this and that. So we're looking into what we can do to modify those at the Cdn edge. The idea being is that we know exactly how far it'll go. Okay? So next, please? So then we start playing around. We start doing some more curls to another Dns. This is our V six only. Next, please. And it worked but this time, what we did is we did it to the one that's using Dns only. We let the the the Cdn do only Dns for us and it worked. Again, why anybody would ever do that is beyond me, but it worked and let's look at the packets."

What we can see is that the the Singapore address is us at a b and our destination address is fifteen twenty seven As we thought, the Cdn is not doing any proxy for us. If it just does Dns, it all works. So now next, please. We're now back to the simple client server world. And on the on the server side, yes. We're seeing everything just as we should. But again, let's go next. And we're back to... We're back to the same standalone nineteen eighties world, and that all works, and we knew that. And even if the Dns is being resolved by the Cdn, that's the truth. Okay. So let's go next. So, if you bypass the Cdn proxy, it all works. Well, great. Right? Okay. Okay. Next, So one of the things we did We've been working with a couple of the cdn providers and some have been very, very transparent with us and said that they found a bug. In their load balance or code, and they fix it. And so we did test before and after So in in November when we did the tests, before they sent before they did the patch, This is the the Alexa top one thousand. What we got is about thirty one percent of the sites responding two packets with extension headers and after they did the fix, Now a hundred percent respond. That's excellent next, please.

I mean, I don't care It works now. You know That's really good. It's it doesn't work to the origin. But they're not dropping packets. One of the things I'll say about this is that is that there are a few companies that disproportionately impact the behavior of what happens on the Internet. Cd providers are one such. And there's two other people that we're working with to other companies who are very large on the Internet and having conversations with them to say, you know, is it why are you blocking stuff? Is it policy or do you not know or is it a bag or because, you know, I think that is a it's interesting. Okay? So next, So So again, what what we want to do is where can we use it and how. And where can we not use it? Definitely on the other side to the origin or over of the Cdn. You're not... You know, I haven't seen anybody even jumping up the Cdn providers. If there's any cdn providers in the room, we would be happy to work with you to help you test. And, you know, we're testing... We're chasing up a few other things as whether we can c so on, whether there's other devices. That seem to be intervening.

As I say, this is we've still got a lot more testing to do. But this is this appears to be our interim results. Next, please. So one of the things that we should think about And I will bring this up in v six ops again. Is a few questions. Do we need a Bc for? Should Cd prioritize v six over v before in Dns. Right now before is being priority ties. Should Cd be encouraged to send extension headers to the origin. I... You know, as I say, I don't know what what is involved there. I don't know their code. Should there be a B. So we should we should think about that. The the another question really is, there are some Cdn who will flat out not even do Ip v six. To the origin server. And now that's interesting. Because again, if I mean, some of this staff I hear in v up about v only this that and the other thing. Well, I you mean, you might wanna talk to some of the Cd vendors before you start talking about only. They're not they're doing before only. So there we are. Okay. Next, please. Is... I think it's the os. Yeah. Is it the last one? So Yep. There we are. Questions, thoughts. Okay. Before I open at you, I would appreciate if people who are physically in the room will join virtual you if possible because it makes much easier to manage his appeal for the chair. Thank you.

So you'd need the cdn the provider to do exactly that put the extension head on on the proxy connection. And to talk to the v four v six back end, it's just been a case of from what we've seen. It's just most network stacks. Do tend to prefer fee four only when they see both? And I know from person experience with cloudflare. It's that their whole selling point was hey, we can v six enable you even if you're not v enabled on the back end then that was one of their Us back in the day. No. No. Thank you. Yes. Yes, of course, they're doing proxy. They're doing two different connect I mean, it couldn't possibly work any other way. Unless you're just doing Dns only. Mean you can see that from the traces. You know, you've got a v four trace. I mean, the only way you can do it. Is if you've got two separate connections and you're rewriting it. Yeah. I... You know, again, I have not looked at the code. I don't know how difficult it is to pass the extension header. I'm just saying as a group and as a community, many other things. Many other times, we prefer v six. And in this case, apparently, we don't. Okay. I guess... I the next of queue. So I I have comment. I simply actually talking about two different problems. Right? One is what Cdn is doing inside for the second connection, is that before Or v six and in general should be transparent to the user because It's the network because they it's a design, they could do different things there. Right? And it should even effect, for example, my a a six only user to reach the server. Right? Because And the doing proxy. I can... I guess you can have your web listening you on before only."

So I think it should be left to to decide how it doing internal stuff. And obviously, I second to what has been said, I think it's expected for to in you Ip Tcp connection. Right? So I don't know that we if we can expect Ip header parameters to be propagated. To the next connection. I don't think the step could even know if it should be doing it or not. I think what you're talking about is probably creating a new for extension further of a given option. Which should indicate if it needs to be propagated and proxy or not, but it looks like a bit complicated tremendously this stage. There's know, that's very interesting I mean, I actually have written some proxy code. And I can do this I'm happy to share my code with you. It's it's relatively non trivial. I mean, our they're relatively... You know, it's not it's not terribly comp located you know. It's just a question. I think there's there are two different questions. There's two different questions. You know, what should we do about Dns? And and then the the v six to the origin There are some cdn that won't even do v six to the origin I... I suppose I felt a little bit more like, that's more of a problem. Than not passing the extension headers. Because if we can be sure that we know that the Cdn edge is going to... That's the...

For some reason I do not see a button to do this, but I declare There's are three people in the insecure and itself. I didn't need to. So this is all good stuff. What corners are you tracing over for this work? Because when things I'd be concerned about with this is that are you having trouble understanding me? No. I'm not... Yeah. I... What what what am I tracing? Yeah. What network cores are you actually going over? Because one of things I'd be concerned about methodology wise is that a lot of larger service providers tend to be what my in terms what stacks they run and how new their boxes are. So would expect this if this is to be working, hopefully, it'll be working on mostly newer boxes, but if you start going over older networks and things start breaking. That might be concern that sort return methodology question into what percentage of the network expected to book to support your use cases. Yeah. I see if I understand your question, it's kinda like... If it let me restate it like, I think are are you asking, like, like, are we going from San Jose to New York york, which is possibly using your equipment, although with the Us being a fourth world country I don't know. But anyway, or are we going you know? To... I mean, somewhere in some one of our rural villages in India. Is that kind of what the question is? It's in the family. So, like, if everything was going over, like, say, At and T, know, At and T had no problems that's not necessarily proving this works, It just proves At and T's, is not problem child.

Great. Ip six extension headers are an Ip level construct. Like, they're carried as part of the Ip packet. That's where they live. What you're talking about here is a web proxy and that works at the web layer. So I don't really see how or why extension headers would be propagated. It's not that we propagate like the T l or the original packet checks. Into the web layer, there are completely different layers.

Actually, I believe it's probably more complicated than that warren. I'm using proxy. As a a stand in. I think they've got a number of different pieces of equipment there.

I suppose is if we know one hundred percent that we've we're terminating at one of the edges.

So now basically, it goes back that you actually go more in in a data mesh fashion where you actually organize yourself in different domains. And then you do that, interfaces are very important, so we need so called bounded context, where we have well defined semantics.

And for the analytical metrics, we need to make sure that inside the organization that we are defining the the semantics. Next slide, please.

I think that is still a lot to do. So ultimately, where we are going to is we have an Api to the network where we do the configuration, which is Ned conference. We have a data modeling language yang, and we have yang push where we are actually getting the metric from the network. So it's a cycle between two young data stores, one on the network while the other one in the data mesh, So the operational metrics, the master is is on the network. While the configuration part is on the data mesh and we just need to make sure that this this cycle is not broken. Next slide.

I'm very impressed with your work. Over many, many, many many different f meetings that's many presentations you've been blazing a trial, which I think is quite fantastic they can been quite leading. I have some questions around models, young models in particular. I think first my my first to try and put this into context. I'm curious how many vendors you're working with simultaneous like to to to to to drag this telemetry from. And my second question, in part here is know words for my Atf meeting. Have you found that we benefit to the open config models? So as an interim step perhaps. Right. So... Yeah. So I'm I'm talking to quite a few network vendors and I think let's say, the problem space is twofold. One is basically getting let's say, having I protocol to expose yang push. So it's let's say, today, basically, every vendor is just pushing json and messages with some sort of metadata and you basically have to make sure that you're covering all those different implementation and somehow make it work into big data. So this is what we're trying to address here. But then yes, the next step is basically going to the yang modules itself, having every operating system vendor of having different young models is a challenge. Yes."

So if you have open config platform for instance, not vendor that is implementing open conflict blood from exactly the same way. So there are all differences so but then where is the value of open conflict config platform if it's not the same everywhere. Right? So Are you normalizing mobilizing models normalizing json at the moment to a particular model. Yes, we do that. But let's say this is this is like I guy told, you know? So you can do it to a certain point, but I mean, the whole goal here is we should not do that in the future anymore because if you look, like if you look back today, how many p are you using to add to onboard data. If you go towards towards yang, I mean, going towards speak data, it will be ten. And if you have to normalize all of the models normalized and entire collection that that that's a lot of work. Yeah. Thank you. Sure. Okay. Rub Cisco. So thank you very much for this presentation. And this is definitely where the industry needs to go to. So this is definitely on the right sort the path things so I think that's all great. I think the one question I have is in terms of how you correlate the data when you receive it. So if you have some network event like the interface going down, you're gonna see Obviously, the interface go go down as a notification, and you'll see that the traffic loss you'll see the peers is going away. You do to correlate that on the sort of clients, I mean you receive that data up using machine learning for that, Are you doing that sort of by hand to look at the time and correlate short period of time. So what the mechanisms you're using"

Let's try machine learning and see what it works, but Soon it discovered like hey, Actually, it's not really bring a lot of value because network are deter. So if an interface goes down and you have b on top know what's happened next. Right? So the Beach goes down the vista are there So the only not deter part is actually somewhat the customer. You know. But even in the masses as a customer is predictable, So we ended up with, like, a very deter network detection where this These things are modeled. So basically, we have a Vpn service we know on that Vpn service. What p are involved we know the V and so on. We know the dependencies we are common that we are not receiving all the data at the same time that we have a certain time window for aggregation and so. And like a network engineer. So the more you see in the network, if you see state changes on your management plane when you see changes in your control plane but the the traffic is still being forwarded properly it might going through a different forwarding pass. It's still okay, but suddenly, if the traffic is being dropped, So your concern gets more and more and therefore obviously scoring that more more and when use get the alert message, you wanna show a network engineer exactly. What you observed? Do you wanna give him all the insights saying, hey, my top policy changed the forwarding device has changed. So at the end,"

So then it's still a case you got like a manual step in the closed loop automation where there's somebody analyzing the operational data then decide the action to take Right next step potentially from there is to try and automate that guess that's where it becomes more complicated in terms of like, should you taking the right action. Right. So I think the next step will be going towards volts transaction Id. So next con already has, like a transaction Id, but that's local to the device. So if you have, like, a global transaction Id for the entire service your configuring, so you can serve basically that your top changed that your configuration changed and you know that all these and configurations you deployed actually calls up to one single transaction. So then now you can the network engine, and say, This is what changed on the network This is what happened on the network Do you consider rolling back? Okay. Thank you. Jeff has one question which been actually talking about it then one come. So back pressure and steak compression obviously lead to a lot of issues with correlation. You've talked about how you're looking at you know, looking at things over a specific time window as a way try to actually compress things down to an event. Is there anything in the model that you're doing in terms of trying to actually say that this is at inference that this occurred, know, based on an event that happened backwards in time. So routing change may have happened, but maybe it take ten seconds before it pops out your routing plane as example. Right. So in in Ip"

It's it's quite hard to find to have Ip to your home or on your mobile network and so on. And then there's a problem of where you measure to. So you have all of these top one million domains lists. And once you resolve them, and once you filter them and get your unique Ip address you're gonna find that loads of servers don't have ip six. And that as Mentioned earlier. A lot of these these domains are not very diverse. So you're gonna have quite a few Ip addresses concentrated into one. And finally, it's kind of hard to scan the Space. There are a big six hit lists, but of course, it's it's it's just much harder to do measurement on on this sixteen. Before. Next slide, please. Well, if you think Ip six measurement is hard, then just think about measuring venture headers. Extension headers are a right pain. They got off to a very rocky start when I guess for my six for standardized, you had loads of routers that didn't necessarily support processing packets which extension headers in hardware. And because they were processing software that handled opened up this routers to dos attack and then from there, you just started getting loads of filtering of these extension headers. So they can be broken. So extension had can can be broken at many different places and it can be a configuration policy or it can be like device support. And Next slide, piece. Measurements have happened over the years. But because it's it's a pretty hard thing to measure. So no wonder you get so many different results.

Okay. Right. So where the measure from is important is especially important way when you measure extension headers. Because you have different levels of transparency to different protocols. Right? So if you're gonna do a measurement campaign using a cloud provider. You'd would better choose a cloud provider that is transparent to what you want to measure in the first place. So what I'm showing you here and this table, is a measurement to the exact same set of destinations and the only thing that is changing is the vantage point is where you measure from. Right? So You can see the sim providers just don't support hope I hope extension headers in the first place. Oh by the way, all of the examples I'm giving are either destination, the destination options station heather or the hope I help of options extension. Right.

Right. So you need many different vantage points. So how do you deduct? Well, you can choose a measurement platform like ripe.

In this case it was a destination option. Extension headers that we sent. You find that fact that path is lost. So you're probably your load dancers on the path.

So just a quick sort of question or comment on term terminology So you're using term layers a lot. And initially, I was thinking it layers in terms of device level, the young models, network service w models. I think when you're talking about later, you're just talking it down to that of network wide layer and you different sub within that layer. Is that correct. Mine took When you're talking about liz we are talking about different starting from physical air and then all the layers up to the service layer which depend like. The up to the services. So we would and that includes also the control layers and computational of those. And this is for dependency. Of what service part, what it depends on and capabilities then to promote provide full life cycle on top of So for example, our layers would be physically tool late really, then we would have a routing they would have tunnel, we would have at the and the end we have Vpn subs. Maybe most. So there are different top apologies in terms of physical and all the virtual top up to the service top. So... But is that all been mold at the network layer rather the They modeled all you using Rf physical devices or the include devices? three four five. Okay. And our C three two four five has four for call contents. Network nodes to exclamation point and link. Okay.

It depends on vr after that depends on connectivity that depends at Etcetera. So the is whenever our we look at the map is to be able to map those layering. Of dependencies. Right? And if you succeed to do that, that's what we're in the park. Then we've got our digital map entity it entities the same one as the intent assurance one.
