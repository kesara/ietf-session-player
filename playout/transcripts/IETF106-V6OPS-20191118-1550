Ferrell T\u0027s basically we would like to receive some help and discussion from the group regarding the draft that we have at v6 ops it was not in the agenda list but if you have some time free maybe we could present it and do to see what people think about it if it\u0027s possible I\u0027d avoid doing things so where are we at for time well we\u0027ve got what 23 minutes I don\u0027t have it in the I can\u0027t can\u0027t quickly present it from here do you have it on a flash drive so do you have it on a flash drive yes or no okay I think that\u0027s gonna take longer than we\u0027ve got so okay so I think we\u0027re gonna adjourn so thank you much I like oh I need the blue sheets back where are they I see one thank you "
