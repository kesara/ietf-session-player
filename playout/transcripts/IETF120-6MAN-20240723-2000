This is not well It's just Tuesday, so I guess you might still need to read it Just a reminder, please be nice to each other when you make in comments It's okay to be not necessary approve the idea, but we need to be nice to the people who are expressing it So, meeting tips before you run to the microphone, please join the meter echo using on-site client, using your phone or laptop and press the button to join the queue Please do this. It makes my life much easier easier Yes, you can find the link to the client and the agenda if you do not see QR code And I guess you don't, but there is a button in the agenda and the ITA website it does allow us to manage the queue properly, and we know who is in the queue, and we know your name but please also state your name when you say in something I would appreciate if you put your mobile phones in silent mode"

Snack router flag signaling DHCP prefix delegation availability to clients and duplication router alert option, and zone identifiers. You see we have a lot of working group documents Great. There is one active individual draft on the agenda IPV6 node requirements and if we are all good in following the like allocated time, we might have some presentations in the time allows category Any last minute agenda bashing? Good. Document status Oli, do you want to start with this? So we haven't published any RFCs over the last two IETF but we have three in the RFC editor queue the segment identifies draft been there for 98 days, but now in all 40 so that should be done very soon, I believe, unless Suresh jumps to the mark and says otherwise.

It's the extension headers limit from tom herbert, which is gone through a fairly thorough shepherd's review and suresh is now writing who is the document shepherd writing up, doing the write-up, and I should then be ready to be passed to the IESG Any further comments before we move to the next slide? slide? Then we have two documents in Working Group last call. It's the source address selection update that has been in last call since February I believe, beginning of February. And then it's the P-flagged one, which has been in last call since 8th of April, I believe Both of those are on the agenda today And let's hope we can make some progress on those Then we have three drafts that we have just adopted It's a snack router flag on the agenda It's the deprecatorial alert, which is also on the agenda and the zone ui which is the, yeah, third round around this track of trying to get some so hard intervarcy newsring user interfaces. We'll see how that goes. And the last slide i believe is is your work then so over to you Yes.

The RC 6724 update Go ahead and go to the next slide, please So if anyone that's been following this, you know, there's this has gone through quite an evolution the original update was to provide a preference for ULA to ULA There were some concerns over that rightly so, and so as we've sort of iterated through and worked through these concerns, we came to the conclusion based on a lot of input from the list that the idea of known local ULAs made a lot more sense. And so we've gone ahead and worked that into the draft. I think everyone will be pretty happy with what's in there You know, basically we take the ability to prefixes on a network and those are flagged as known to be local we use a number of different mechanisms for figuring out what those, that they are local Next slide, please So because of that evolution, we changed the title of the draft to better reflect what it actually is now we added some heuristics"

This leads to the known local ULA addresses being preferred over GEO to GUA, making them a little bit more useful GUA to GUA remains preferred over other non-local ULA addresses Also, ULA to ULA is preferred over IPV4 to IPV4, which helps in migrating to IPV-6-only environments in some ways, and we add a bunch of clarifications that were provided, thankfully from David Farmer and some other folks on the list to improve the text around things like type C hose when A and B are still out there next slide So, open questions that we need answered I think, before the last call finishes up And thankfully, Tim was nice enough to put the list consensus as it looked to up in here. Should we treat the FC? 00 slash 8 differently from FD? FD-008, list consensus wasn't really there, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of really strong views so we proposed condensed that section to refer only to FC007 is all uLA being preferred over all IPV4 okay? List consensus seem to be yes So we'll keep that, the proposal is to keep that precedent Should we support addition of other off-link known local preferences, the list consensus was so far yes. So we've prepared to include that explicitly in section five And should we add other additional? prefixes and entries for RFC 1918? List sort of was no on that one. So we're going to leave that alone. Didn't feel like it needed to be addressed, really. Next slide So final questions I don't want to use up too much more time. Are the heuristics in section 5?"

There's some tech that's been provided by David that you can read here the proposed text is you know, regardless of how the PIO flags are set, PIO length of some text that's been provided by David that you can read here. The proposed text is, you know, regardless of how the PIO flags are set, PIO length 64, and from within FD008 00.0.8 are not already within FD 000.08, FD.00 colon colon 8 are not already covered in the known local prefix list. They must be added to the list with an assumed preface link of 48 So the question is, do we do a should or must? There's a note there that, you know it sort of details the RIO preferred method that folks can look at. But next slide, please Those are the questions that we need to get answered for this one. I think we're really, really close It seems like it's a lot more useful than the original draft was and so i think if we can get some conversation around those open questions, we can hopefully button this up Lorenzo Khalidi, can you go back to the slide about open question? No, before that, yeah So I have tried to implement this. I actually have implemented something that looks like this It's not all checked in, but some of it is. I look at the latest text and draft, and there's like this eight-point algorithm which looks pretty complicated. I couldn't honestly tell you if my implementation is complied with that or not Nor if I rewrote it, could I tell you if it was complied I think that needs to be simplified What my implementation does, it just looks at all that I addresses and all the routes and it just adds implicit 48s, covering 48s for all of them And that's it. I think that's what the draft says that I should do for FD 00 but I'm not sure because it's too complicated. So that would be sort of helpful. Is this a type?"

Oh, FC00 slash 7, I see Yeah, FC slash 8, nobody knows how it works And I think the risk is that if we write down how it should work, then we're sort of implementations may grow to like do what we think and then when and then it will limit our freedom in the future to define how IFC 0 slash 8 works I would sort of generate speaking I would just keep the same behavior for everything but you know, like you said, there's no concentrist I think it's hard to do anything for FC 0.5 slash 8 because we don't know what it does Other than that, I do support this. I think it's great I think it will finally make Yula useful, which is something that we've been struggling with for, I don't know, 10 years. So that's great Thank you Can I jump the queue a bit just to answer that? Tim Shan, so should we put F-Chi? years, so that's great. Thank you. Can I jump the queue a bit just to answer that? Tim Chan, so should we put FC 00 slash 7 in there that would embrace both current U Euler's and maybe ULAC or whatever it becomes? or should we just have the draft say FD zero slash eight and ignore? FC 00 slash 8? and maybe ULAC or whatever it becomes or should we just have the draft say FD zero zero slash eight and ignore FC zero zero slash eight well you can't do that without changing the drive because right now the draft says FC and if FFD behavior differently. Right it says for FC, it should do whatever's on the network, on the wire, and for FD, it should basically as far as i can tell it says for fc do whatever on the wire, and for FD, kind of cap it up 48 As far as I can tell, that's what it says. But if you want to, make it all the same, you need to pick which one So Tim Chandigan, so the question is, do we just write that those heuristics, which have been simplified a bit in the version that we haven't yet put to the list as a dash 10? Do we just define that for FD zero? slash 8, or do we still write? it with future FC 00?"

Just treat you always the same if we ever define the other centralized ones then that can just figure out how this should change But don't try to do it now. Just treat them the same Genling Goa totally agree that the algorithm currently looks way complicated for exactly for differences between two types of you ULAs. Actually, I was going to suggest yes, let's just read the whole slash seven the same way but now I'm thinking we are not supposed to use FC right? Yep. So maybe we do not need to say anything they should be just deprived, not used, and just completely ignored. Maybe it would motivate people to do the right thing and use FD Like I don't have strong preference, but we definitely shouldn't be treating them like have separate rules. We either have slash 8 or 1 slash 7 seven. Just wanted to clarify how that came about, FD there was some robust discussion about that And there was a compromise where you know there were certain participants who were like very convinced that FD should be slash 48. And people said well okay but for fc which we haven't defined yet we should be more flexible. So that's why the complexity came about Yeah, suresh krishnan, I was going to say pretty much for general said. Somehow she read my mind, like she read my picture pretty much what Jen said. Somehow she read my mind, like she read my pecha-cucha as well somehow, but anyway, but I think the point is like we don't know how FCs, FC FC00-8 is going to be used So I think we should not make any presumption about it. Like, you know, like Bob's said like let it decide when it comes up like you know how we deal with that like, and where you put it in the preference table. So I would just say like stick to FD zero zero slash eight and don't special case the"

The network is telling you that Since the specs aren't written, I don't think you could learn, I don't think you could rely on any information that you know, might get changed by a specification later, if you see what I mean. I think there, I think conceptual difference between those two things I think I have something useful to say, actually. It occurs to me that, it occurs to me that like my implementation needs to do something, right? But it occurs to me that if we basically stay silent on FC00 slash A, we are sort of implicitly giving it the other label, which will match nothing so if i get so so okay so the other thing is like, if I get an RA, if somebody number, my implementation in the slash, in FC00 slash 8, which it can do, right, like I'll get an RA, I'll get an RA on a PAO, I'll get the legacy behavior, which is what we're trying to avoid here. Right, so we are trying to make you, LA more useful but if we don't apply our new no get an RA I'll get an RA on a PAO I'll get the legacy behavior which is what we're trying to avoid here right so we are trying to make ULA more useful but if we don't apply our new known local insertion to FC 00 slash 8 then that is still using the legacy bad behavior, which we don't want Also, you have to figure out what happens when some of it is FD-00. Is that the same as FC-00? FC001-2-345 if I've got an FD-0? address? I don't know.

My understanding, or my recollection rather I should say from 4193 is the difference between you C and D is is allocation policy not a brief expoundary or anything like that So that's fair.

Thank you running to the mic. Sorry, Tim Chan again. So go back, no, forward a slide. No, that one, yeah. So does the room have any? comment here? The original list discussion was that RIOs are the preferred method for deriving what we're adding here and therefore for RIOs we say must and for POs we say should, but from what Lorenzo just said, he's obviously about to say it again, we should just have the same for both and I think you've in your implementation you've sort of done a it, you've done it, whether you consider it from a must or should I think from an implementation perspective, it's also moderately difficult to look at RIOs and PIOs you have to sort of either do so on Linux, you have to either listen for RTM new route, RTM sort of, looking at root and IP addresses is something, it's data that you have to have anyway in the stack, so it's a lot easier to implement it that way. That's why I did it that way My code doesn't actually look for RIsop or Ios. It just says a here's the addresses I have. I think that's actually you know, easier to implement and use and more useful.

Great, thank you Ted, I can see you next Boycott Okay, so this is just a quick update on the snack router RA flag draft, which is extremely complicated and long and will take you at least two minutes to read So a quick summary for anybody who is not aware of this, SNAC routers are self-configuring routers they join stub networks to existing infrastructure automatically without any sort of operator intervention other than just plugging it in. And we currently have one use case for this, which is threadboard routers. So this is an IOT router that connects us to an 802.5 mesh doing six low pan And in order to make that work, these are disparate media, so we can't have them just bridge together So we had to actually do IPV6 routing. We couldn't do it with IPV4 because NATs are not bidirectional And so, yay, a use case for IPV6 that cannot be in any way solved with V4 So that's what we have. And the trick here is that in order to make this work we need to be able to tell the difference it between advertisers advertisements that are sent by these SNAC routers and router advertisements sent by infrastructure so that we can prefer just the infrastructure stuff rather than publishing stuff from our snack router if it's not needed. Next slide So the document's been adopted There's a dash zero one actually I think now that had some updates from some IANA comments We've asked for early allocation of the flag"

So it would be really good to fix that sooner rather than later. And like I said you know there there's been discussion about using this bit or a second stub Stubruder bit on the Stub Network side but the use of this particular bit on the infrastructure network side is very stable and we don't envision it changing at all. So I don't think that's any reason not to allocate the flag now And so basically the question is a can we have the flag bit And B, is there, does anybody have anything that they think needs to be done to this document before we go to last? call? And C, if not, let's go to last call Lorenzicility, I was able to read the document since you started but I noticed though that it said a stub router that is not explicitly configured as part of the network infrastructure must set it to one. Good It doesn't say who or what or what might set it to zero. Presumably, an infrastructure would a must set it to zero. Maybe we should say that that's that's a good point and I think I agree with you Yeah. So please send a diff or a poll request or comment Other than that, yeah, working group last call, sounds good. Cool, thanks david oran. Online I think you need to add interactions with, RA guard and other things like that So we actually have an appendix in the snack document that talks about that. I don't think it's a appropriate to talk about it here because it's just not you know"

So if you really want to understand the way that the protocol works, you really need to read the SNAC simple document I would agree with you on that However, even just noting that there are could be interactions would be worth noting I think But, I mean, if you can, if you can an interaction that you think should be noted I would be happy to add that or Jonathan would be happy to add that but I can't think of one off the top of my head. I mean, it's an RA If you have RA guard turned on, it's going to get filtered, so it doesn't matter what bits are in the flags Exactly I want to echo Kim Winters, sorry QA Cathay, I want to echo what Lorenzo said you should definitely tell people if you want them to turn it off when to turn it off by default. And then the other thing, I couldn't find anything in the snack text and maybe this is a snack comment more than anything of what to do when there's conflict or anything about conflict two routers giving out different flash what someone should do with that on a network The flag is specific to the router It's identifying whether or not the router is a snack router, so there shouldn't be it doesn't even make sense to compare two different RAs to see which one is which. I meant flapping as in the router was changing being a snack router or not. Does that not happen? It's either the bit is always set or it's never set I think it might be good to point out that that's a thing to think about, but certainly we normally would, we don't expect a snack router to ever not be a snack router. Well, I shouldn't say that You could have something that can be a snack router. It could also be manual configured. If it were manually configured, it would certainly make sense not to set the bit. Okay So that answers my question. The answer is we should just tell people when not to send the bit"

    "text": "and when to, and that you don't expect complex I think would be the general thing there. Yeah Another corner case, what happens if a rotor is a snack router and it in infrastructure route at the same time? So for example, you have a CPE was a radio for ZIPB infrastructure route at the same time? So for example, you have a CPE was a radio for Zigby. So I think you're talking about something like maybe an ERO which has a thread radio in it and is also a Wi-Fi router. And in that case, I would argue that's not a C snack router. That's just an infrastructure router that happens to have a thread interface Now, that doesn't mean that that's exactly what they're implementing, but that's my claim I just think this should be added to the specification Yeah, I think we, I mean, we had a big discussion about that in one of the interim meetings, but I, and I think we added text, or at least we have a poll or an issue open for that david lamparter I do think David Farmer's comment about RA gardens of like a a poll or an issue open for that. david lamparter, I do think David Farmer's comment about R.A. Gardens and stuff like that makes sense. I also think you answered it on stage and you should just ask that to the draft and be done. Add what? The text you said on stage, RA Guard is not going to care about it and that's it. Okay, fair So there's Christian also talk to like david's fine part of it is like my fault that, like, this thing got split down on board and six men, because, like i wasn't snack and i saw this and i say like maybe like you know telling six man what they're doing with it is not like they don't have to read the whole snack spectra snack and I saw this and I say like maybe like you know telling six man what they're doing with it it's not like we didn't have to read the whole snack spec to understand what they're doing with it so if somebody wants to read more they should go to read the snack spec, but I'd just tell them about the use of this bit, right? Right. So as an investigator of that, I think what Ted is doing is the right thing to do. Like, you know, if you need more details of snack document needs to take care of it. But Six Man is like really about like, hey, is using the bit the right thing to do, and I think it is right? And I think that's what Sixth Man is deciding on So I'd like to keep that discussion here and then the substandard discussion in snack thank yeah i mean one way to put that would be basically if you are"

Lawrence, you are up next Thank you No. I mean, no voice-operated clicker. Is it some AI thing that uh okay so we have uh actually renamed this draft. There was a lot of confusion and I admit as an author only having understood some of it like fairly recently so I think that is hopefully reflected in the better reflected in the text. Next slide so that you'll see that the title is different so what is the goal of this work? This is partly a recap, but we have learned some of the details. Thanks to, thanks to recent discussion. So the goal was always and now remains to signal that the network supports the PD per device addressing model, which is an addressing model, which is will soon be published by the IETF as an RFC. It's in the RFC editor-kew, and so this is sort of kind of a bake model that the IETF has documented And just like we have the A flag for Slack and the M flag for DHPV6, we have a flag that signals this Why do we need a flag? Oh, that the most important reason we need a flag is that if a device implements this model on the device side"

And that'll all work as a intended the problem is that there are too many devices that ask for these prefix and get them the network will run out of space if you have a slash shake it will get one. And that'll all work as intended. The problem is that there are too many devices that ask for these prefixes and get them, the network will run out of space. If you have a slash 60 at home, you've got 16 devices, 16 phones, ask for prefixes your network is now out of space all right so this is why the device needs, this is why it flag is needed. There are other reasons why it might be nice to have a flag like say, oh, try PD or don't try it, but that So this is why the device needs, this is why a flag is needed. There are other reasons why it might be nice to have a flag, like say, oh, try PD or don't try it, but there's a secondary. This is the reason why we need it And again, why Slack Size prefix? Because that's what the model says. The model that we have published is an RFC or will be Okay, next slide There's been a after last call there's been a sort of fairly lively discussion that, as I said, that the operational model draft is in the RFC at a queue. We've had a last call. It was quiet for a while and then there was a bunch of discussion more recently We think, as authors, that the discussion mostly focused on the deployment model, not the protocol. And so that kind of, that discussion kind of should have happened, did happen actually partly on the discussion of the V6 UPS draft, which is now in the RFC editor queue, but that sort of some of that got repeated here which is fine uh we didn't really change anything in the protocol specification. The diff is not very big. So next slide Here are some of the issues that were discussed discussed Some folks felt that it should be possible to use arbitrary prefix length. And basically the question was, why can't we say that P means that PD is available, but you could get a 127 a 96, an 84, you could get whatever, right? So we clarified the text, and we renamed the draft to make it very clear that this is signaling PD per device Why? Okay, so the reason"

Because you're not going to run out of space on existing networks, right? This is one of the problems we're trying to solve here. Home networks, you ask for a signal because that's what PD device per device says you get it and then you burn down the network right so if you do this with an 80 or 96, it doesn't matter, right? you can't really rely on a DHPV6 server to know if you're a PD per device because it's not written in your DGP requirement right? It's like you don't know if the client needs a 64, like if a plug in a home gateway, that needs a 6 because that's what 7084 says If I'm an Android device that has a PD per device implementation, I don't need a 64, I could use a 64, I could use Slack, it doesn't really matter too much, right? So I think that's why, and so even if you say, well, you know, the device should just ask for a pre-file, and then the server would say, 64 is too big, I don't have one, no prefix avail to you. In that case, it'll slow down provisioning. And I don't, and then like one of the goals, again, was to make sure that PD per device is deployable and works well And I think that would be sort of making it slow like this is not a good outcome. So this is why the text is the way it is and next slide There was other questions like, can we signal other PD use cases? we don't really know what they are at the moment There was one that was suggested to be using tethering We sort of like, there seems to be consensus that this is out of scope right? It's left for future work. Again, deployment models that use smaller, longer prefixes don't need to be signaled And you could argue that, you know, want to signal tethering, but, you know, there's consensus that should be done in a separate document. So this one is sort of resolved, I think Next slide There's a concern about prefix exhaustion We don't really think as authors that this is, and there was also support on the list for that point of view, you know,"

People know how to solve this problem And yes, it is obviously different from Slack or DHPV6 INA, which can't run out of space but this is not something that's insurmountable. It's inherent to deployment model and we think there's a good tradeoff here, right? Because, and also some folks observed that actually planning for 64s is easier because IPV6 has more bits to sell Next flag. Also, the P-flag should be zero by default in the document There's a concern about address of address space um that was a concern that was raised during the obstraft discussion. Yes, this is not forever everyone, and that's the reason why we need a flag. You can't run this on home networks today But it is acceptable because many networks do use 64 per device. All your mobile phones have 64s, right? And this is not a earth-chattering development. It's been the case since we deployed IP6 on mobile And also we actually do think that there is enough space for this It's true that not all environments will have space, but that the amount of total space, if you actually can request space it's actually not excessive. Next slide Oh, and there was another question I was like, why are we creating a new addressing model? Well, that's kind of a question for V6 ops. Why did we create? it? But I mean, I think there does seem to be rough consensus that this model does make sense in some places, right? um and as for why we burn a flag for this, well, both of the current addressing models that we have, which is D.HPV6 and Slack, they do have flags And, you know, this model is an operational model which will be published by the IETF, and it actually has meaningful advantages in terms of scaling and terms of ability to form as many addresses as you like while still giving the operating the benefits of tracking and forensics and accountability And we think this is actually a really important bargain"

So I just noticed one thing. I don't know if you wanted to address this on our, but I'll just throw this up, right? So one of the things is to kind of show that, like you have like slackable prefixes to hand out, right? Is there some kind of runtime? checking on this? Like, is the router, you're going to turn it off or not? I'm just throwing this off, so just think about it. I don't want an answer because I don't have a good answer for it right so like because one of the goals was to have the client not try and get no addresses available right from there so we'll just turn this off and that and if it does turn it off will the DHCP state machine keep going for the addresses to renew them right just think about this and write something over it because I think it deserves to be said, it's not the draft. I just check the latest version. Yeah, it might be possible when the router is the DHP server, but when it's a central server, can't really do that, yeah. But we could say the root may, you know Hi, Lorenzo. Tom Hale from BT. We've had some comments about this in the past, and we had a really good debate about it and I was I've kind of been thinking about on and off ever since The suggestion here that we use a flag albeit they are valuable, to make this optional configurable in a fashion so that it's not a sort of a static rule, I think solves most of the concerns that I had"

That's really what we are trying to go for partly, yeah you Eric Klein, AD hat on, I think Clarifying that this is a flag, just to indicate that the PD per device model is in effect or is available rather, I think that's very clarifying And it means that if we want to start doing funky changes to that model, that model has to get updated about this flag So yeah, and if we want to change that, you have to convince the V6Ops AD to go Yankee back from the RFC editor But anyway, so thank you very much for that clarification.

I think this draft leaves too many of the corner cases unresolved and that some of those are easy fixes, and I think we should should do those but one thing that is definitely clear to me is that we cannot research network extensions only to to large enterprises which this seems to propose So one solution to that is that of course that the PD or the P flag only applied to the Nd cash problem and we we solve them network extensions problem elsewhere You know, to Eric Klein's comment I mean this this sort of yet to not argument that we shouldn't split work across multiple working but because we're kind of held hostage now to decisions done in a different working group. But that's, you know, clearly something we have to feed back to the IESG As an example, you know, I have, I don't think I should, I don't know quite and that's probably something we should discuss in this working group what the best resolution is to the issue I think I have about six listed here"

There's about six of them I think I have on my list Okay, so the, I not, you know, obviously not Eric, but I think that to your point around, you know, this is why we shouldn't split work between working groups, you know this was not an exercise that was carried out in secret in a different working group working across purposes, right?

We hope that they don't infuse router alert option now may continue to do so even in future versions we hope that they don't in future versions but they may future protocols must not use the router alert option. Next slide line what's the motivation? Well, we want to motivate towards an architecture and which HBH options will be processed on the for forwarding plate. We want to reduce HBA access to the control plane This will reduce operator motivation to this discard all pockets containing HBH options which is what many operators do today Next slide. So the question is, if we definitely the router alert option to we have other means to do what it does today? Do we have alternatives to the router alert option?

Repeat until you get to the endpoint. This solution is why widely, widely deployed. Most RSA RSVPTE, well, most RSVPTE implement these days, used to use the IPv4 router alert. They don't anymore As far as they know, there are no IPV6 RSVP implementations Next slide Now, let's talk about the MLD V2 use case. In this case, you want to send an MLL V2 message address to IPV6 multicast address And you want to cause every router on the segment to examine and process the message, even if it has no interest in that multi- address. So how can we do this for that? the router alert? Next slide Well, same trick You would encode the multicast address in the PDU and the MLDV2 message You send the message to a well well-known IPV-6 multicast address It would be a new one, like all MLB rounders.

And remember, the whole idea here is that users should have to actually type in IPV6 addresses If this use case arises, it should be one where you cut and paste because you get the IP address from some other source In the really worst case, you type it in, but let's hope that would never happen Next slide, please So during the adoption call of the draft, which is basically a lot of wrapping text around that detail technical proposal we had to make one change for the adoption calls to succeed.

Is there any point to doing this if it doesn't apply to Webbra? browsers? Um There are use cases in the um in the document which i didn't go through this time, which we did go through the last time My favorite one is there's no way to put a display filter into Warshark specifying the interface identify So you capture a lot of stuff with wire shock and you want to focus on things that had that interface identifier in the there's no way to do it.

Thanks Thanks Lorenzo Kalili, so do you, I mean on one hand, I'm not even sure this is necessary, right? Isn't that like, since, part of the textual representation of IPD6? addresses already? Not really It's sort of a bit strange because it got out added, you know, after sometime after the normal textual format was defined. I'm pretty sure it's not in the in the the one that told us to lowercase or IPV addresses. I can't really remember the number, but I think if it was in there, we'd have referred to it in the text tool already. So I think it isn't. I think it's quite disjoint. It just crops up in 4,000 and so. Right. So I guess the other question is like, if 4,07 says that I pv6 address is written down in text, must always have the interface identifier then what is this document really? It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that it just says this is how you do it okay just doesn't say that it doesn't say that it just says this is how you do it okay it just says um you know the way you wait is this. It doesn't say you have to do it okay but if it if i if i you know, the way you do it is this. It doesn't say you have to do it.

Well, the difference is that internally inside your software, you need to represent an IPV6 addresses that difference is that internally inside your software, you need to represent an IPV6 address as a two items actually. I mean, properly written IPV6 software has to always treat the address as two items The 128 bits of the address plus zone identity I guess I'm asking is the notion. And a lot of girls don't do that"

Is the notion of a web browser well defined or is it the people who object know who they are? I don't think this is a right working group to get an answer to that question, honestly because there are lots of programs that handle URIs that are not browsers, right? And some of them do this right You know, when I patched WKET to do this right, it turned out to be two lines of C code because they do everything else right, they carry addresses around as addresses plus zone identifies which is basically what you have to do So if you're code that in addresses plus zone identifies which is basically what you have to do so if if your if your code that interprets an IPV6 address whether it is their u URI or otherwise, has the right model internally, then this is trivial If your code doesn't do that right, if it thinks IPV6 address is just a hundred twenty eight nothing else, then your code won't work It's a strange thing but there's a lot of code around that doesn't recognize this problem Okay, David, you're next in the queue. Yeah, can you hear me? Yes, thank you um so first off uh I'm fine with punting to the IESG whether it should be an update or not That's what they're there for. They can decide that The other thing is it is not a fact that link local addresses have to have an interface identifier The specification does not say that It says if you want to include one, this is how you do it. And in fact, if you price, if you if you build on not say that. It says if you want to include one, this is how you do it. And in fact, if you proper, if you build the correct default zone,"

It will it will at least provide some guidance to some applicant that have ignored this problem Yeah, you're completely right, of course that if the default zone thing is done properly, then you can manage with specifying it until you had a case we is done properly, then you can manage without specifying it until you have a case where you can't, if it actually matters, skip you have two interfaces actually on your machine.

Okay, you're welcome Okay, team you're next All right hello. So I'm here to talk about a proposed update or revision of RSC 8504, the IPVC node requirements. This is something that myself, John and Tim as authors of 8502 all three of us are happy to work on. Once we've discussed this, and if there's agreement to proceed, maybe we can take on extra authors, but that's where we are at the moment, all three of the original authors are happy to do this.

There have obviously been many V6-related RFCs published in the last five years, and there are also some very interesting jobs new version, an update. There have obviously been many V6-related RFCs published in the last five years, and there are also some very interesting drafts in progress at the moment as well that we might want to reflect in this document and that might become RFCs by the same this becomes an RFC if we do go ahead with it. Also I think a couple of meetings ago go, one or more of the chairs did indicate that they would welcome some work on this Next slide So yes, we're going to need your input to make this happen. Obviously, the three of us could hack away at it but some steer would be very, very useful So what we've done is posted an initial zero zero That is essentially 85 as it was But with, I think there's like half a dozen small edits, just very much changes for things that are clearly obsolete and or need to be changed and updated, non-semantic change one might say. So what would we do to? do this revision? There's obviously addition of text related to all the new RCs that have been published since 8504 was published Some of there may also be some changes in requirement level that have happened with other documents that have been published or the way you know, thinking has changed around May, Shrewden, Mus There may also be some changes in requirement levels that have happened with other documents that have been published or the way thinking has changed around May, Shrewd, and Must on various things There's some things also that will now be obsolete or"

Anyway, your input is very important to help steer us, the authors, as editors of this document Next slide So a quick plug here for those who I guess most people are aware of Brian's, sorry, book six, not six book project helps here. If you look at the link there you'll see part of this online book that's captured in Git is a list of all the RFCs, and you can deduce from that the ones that are in use since 8504 So there's 38 standards track RFCs related to V6, 14 information, 1 BCP and 4 experiment So that's 50 plus documents to look through That's a rough approximation. There may be some that actually have RFCs lower than 8504 that were published as we were finalizing 8504. So that gives you an idea of the scope of 50 documents to look through. Plus, potentially, there's current drafts, which, as I said, may be published as we progress 8504 if you are aware also of any rfs that are not in that list on book six, please do say so. I'm sure Brian would welcome some edits to add those if something has been missed And this final thing on this slide, we did previously discuss this idea of a kind of a living RFF for node requirements or a living document for it but that hasn't happened yet. Maybe that will happen with this revision We can come to that later. Next and last slide, I think. Yeah, so here's some, last slide some examples of things that we might change things we might add.

That's not really captured in in the current document this that area Segment routing the iom stuff slack and thrash number that's almost out as an RFC that's something that we may wish to include. Security side of things, and some things that are currently drafts that look very promising as things that we might want to work in, so the PD per device stroke client and the V6O mostly model and there's things we may also wish to with those are just examples And there are things you may wish to remove So can we finally just remove mobile IPV6? can we remove send, can we remove other things? Interesting to hear. And the final one that's yeah, I think I discussed this with Tim. So this is an IPV6 node requirement, but it kind of in a way we would like to say node should implement DHPV4 option 108 but I'm not sure we can put that in this document. Maybe we can have it sort of as a little, sort of a appendix of things you should do if you've got V4 to help IPV6 or something. And I think that's it.

And then the second question is, what do you think of the we've said here? here? jen linkova, no heads on. Yeah, so thank you very much I personally think it's a good idea I definitely think, yeah, I have a few ideas what should be added like Pref6 for support on host is highly desirable currently.

Yeah, for like, yeah, but it's use of yeah so move to v6 mostly but for example if host has a lot support. So I think what I can also draw from what you're saying, though, I think in 2019, there was quite a strong feeling if you should deploy dual stack and enterprise that's the way to go. I think now when I speak to people at some of them, more forward-thinking universities who are already dual-stack, they want to remove the V4. So all the things you said are about removing V4 to go V6 towards V6 only So I think that's maybe another theme of the update, but it's something that we need to make sure is well included Lorenz Galilee, DGP4 Option 108 is an IPV6 node requirement If a device supports IPv4, then it should if an IPV6 node supports a few more, then it should support this. Right. It doesn't have to support IP4, in which case, it doesn't have to support IPV4 the only thing you put in the document that is sort of an IPV4 requirement, though, it's... That's okay it's a requirement for IPV6 nodes it's not our requirement for IPV6 stacks running on those. No, I agree, I just something we thought we should flag for the want of another word just to check everyone's okay with that Yeah, I'm not sure how did the folks actually read all of the documents, or the folks read these documents? in their entirety? There's sort of a lot of stuff there I feel that maybe it would be more useful to have that these, you know, actually read all of these documents? Do the folks read these documents in their entirety?

Eric, what was it Tim next? I think it's me next. Tim Winners QA CAFE. So a couple things I just wanted to point out One about the header extension text. This document was sort of unique in that we wrote, I had forgotten about that we wrote a bunch of text about header chain limits that obviously we're going to remove hopefully and point to the newer drafts. But I think that was written by the authors of these. They did. Tom did send me that text that I said in there. So there's good news there that we're going to update those, which I think to make sense For the V4 option, I kind of sounds like people are cool with it, so I think we should go with it. I also think, yeah we probably should add a section for V6 only and write some words about C-Class and other things that people should think about if they want to try to run a V6 V-C-6-4 and stuff. Yeah, do all that stuff Yep Eric Vink, yes, please go on with this work for sure. Regarding the DGPV4 I mean, the document is about requirement from an IPV6 note, not APV6 required for an APV6 node. So you are all set and even if we kind of stretch somehow the process go for it, right? That makes sense. Something which is missing that you want to add is Lorenzo and Jen's draft which is mostly approved in the HC, registering the self-generated addresses because that's important for operations So that does what?

Things are changing so often and actually came up in conversation internally at work recently. So quite useful. I would say that, you know, on the removed column can't say anything particularly wrong with suggesting that we get rid of those adding all seems pretty good I would think segment routing over IPV6 is probably crossing the stream a little bit too much. I'm not sure that's something we need to start thinking about every single device supporting And it certainly has a different aim versus a lot of the other things on that list. But yeah, good work And if I can help support it, I shall. Thanks, Tom I suddenly remember going to say we had interesting discussion in the lobby today about what the host should operating system should do in terms of implement APIs which might render CLAD Either unnecessary or not use too much right? I don't know if we would be capable of formalize this, but maybe we need to think about, is there anything to say? I heard that TAPS been doing something in that area which might be helpful.

Obviously this is general nodes, right? We're not going to go into all the soft wire and map T and DS light that lives in a very different place far far away. This is just for the requirements yeah i think we can do something there And I noticed you had the IPV6 segment routing in there as well. Is that I mean, since that's not something that's generally on any node, I mean, you usually like service provider nodes and maybe like, if you have a heterogeneous network and you have appliances, which is probably rare, but, you know, it's not a general node requirement that you would have IPA segment routing you know so I'm not sure would that be something that still would be applicable here? Again, I have trouble hearing that. I caught most of that So yeah, I think for segment routing, we're going to have to be, obviously, we do not want to apply that to all nodes for sure, and we don't want to even probably apply it to all routers So, yeah, we'll add some text in there just kind of pointing people on the agenda direction is what we've done in the past for bigger technology like that like hey if you're looking for this and you're in this document please go"

Generally speaking, we're talking about the loopback, which defines two new ICMPV6 types. It's a very simple to ICMP Echo, except that one we send the loopback request that's the blue packet at the top. The loopback reply includes the original loopback request as part of the payload in the reply so what do we get from this? We get the IPV6 header of the original request as well as the extension headers, the options, and so on. And there are a lot of different use cases that can benefit from this, for example, I.OEN path tracing, IFA, anything related to measurement"

And basically what this demo does is kind of an IOM ping. It's similar to the ping utility that we're all familiar with but it collects per hoc information using IOM And using the Lubeck message, you get that information back to the center so it can display it on the screen and that's what we see here And I should mention that the implementation is very simple because basically Lubeck is actually very similar to trace wrap, the way trace wrap works So that's just a side note In general, the current version of the draft accommodates, we believe it accommodates the main comments we received on the mailing list And there is another draft which is going to be discussed in a few minutes, which has a very similar goal.

That's type 160, not 128 to approve node, like any IP message. It's encapsulated in an IPV6 header, and the IP header may carry extension headers Next slide The probe node received the probe. It returns an ICMP extended echo response The extended echo response contained an extension header a la RFC 4 4884. The new extension header contains well, the old extension header, contains some new objects and those objects reflect what the HPH options, routing, and this destination options look like. When they arrived at the probed node. That gives the probing nodes some idea of how those options changed en route. Why would you want to do that? Well, there were some applications that do things like, well, they have mutable extension headers. They change the extension header on in the path Sometimes they do things like collect OAM information at each node along the path So the probing node might want to see what it collects And again, I think Tal has it right, the last two drafts need to be merged And that's it Thank you, Ron.

So if there is some amplification, it won't be too bad. I think it is much simpler and also completely eliminates the security issue if you just require that replies reply is the same size as the request and say that the request by the host should just be large enough to account all the information, i.e., you could you could just suggest that the request should always be 1280 Ooh, good idea So, just generally in this section clarifying questions that are quick or good, but discussion should be on the list.

So in this diagram, for example, you have node two has neighbors, node one, node three, and node 4. But node 1 only sees node 2 and node 5 five as neighbors. So multi-hop forwarding might be necessary for node one to be able to communicate with nodes three and four This applies also to any local network type not just the mobile ad hoc networks But if you look at these interfaces on these these with nodes three and four. This applies also to any local network type, not just the mobile ad hoc networks. But if we look at these interfaces on these routers, what addresses can we add to those interfaces? RFC-5889 says that GUA's and UALAs should be used, but the problem with that is that coordinated provisioning and isolated networks is not always possible, because there's not always a DHCPV6 server or a Slack router sending RAs And RFC589 also explains why link local addresses have limited use as to the ad hoc network interface multilink nature So what we need is a new type of addresses, and we'll call those multi-link local addresses or MLAs Next chart So why do we need LAMs? They are going to have extremely high assurance of uniqueness so that it will conflict with other nodes that are in the same operating region They're self-generated or self-asserted by each node so we don't need to have infrastructure that assigns the addresses The uniqueness persists across network petitions and merges and it supports multi-hop forwarding at the adaptation layer, at a layer below IP They're greater scope than link local addresses and can be a applied to multiple interfaces. So nodes assigns an MLA to an ad hoc interface to the slash 128 using optimistic assignment procedures Nodes may also assign a GUA to overlay multi-network interface when an internet gateway is present So in this figure you see that each one of these nodes is assigned an MLA.

Type two is to use the pre- 2001-20 slash 28 and that's from RRC 7343, which is the orchid format, also used by the hip hit And then type three is to use the prefix 2001-30-colon-colon slash 28, which is used by hierarchical host identified by our tag and that's documented RFC 9374 So then the next steps is to decide whether we can have this as a working group item.

Okay, everything you know, 2000 column, three has been delegated but you know, 4,000 colon, colon, three is IESG approval. And all the rest of it. According to BCP 20, which is the IANA considerations, document, there is no requirement that the rest of it. According to BCP 26, which is the IANA considerations document, there is no requirement there's a request under the policy IESG approval. There is no requirement that the request be documented in an RFC and community review is possible under IESG approval, but it's not even required. So basically these rules say that AIE I, Anna and the IESG between them can delegate the ATARA approval, but it's not even required. So basically, these rules say that the IA and the IESG between them can delegate the entire IPV6 address space without asking anybody And a few of us noticed this and we think it's inappropriate Next please So the proposal is a BCP, which is the draft. Requests I Ianna to update the registration procedures section of the address space registry to show the policy as IETF review that's intentionally not standards track, a standard to track document required but it does require a document and it does require the community discussion before the IESG can approve some track document required, but it does require a document and it does require the community discussion before the IESG can approve something that's under IETF review So that basically fixes the bug that the community isn't involved in allocating address space.

So it did appear, I think, from that discussion thread at the end of last year, it seemed like this is seemed like a good point to maybe try to introduce this and possibly making a flight mod of a to the standard for for slack you know that fixed boundary and changing that that fixed that's fixed boundary slightly. So next slide next slide. So one of the issues that had come up in the past when we had brought up this this concept of having a variable slack so not having the 64 bit but actually making it, making it to use can have a variable length mask and you're not stuck in slas 16 slack so not having the 64 bit but actually making it making it so you can have a variable length mask and you're not stuck in slash 64 is the race to the bottom So what we would in here what we would do is we would only allow and if part of this is just an additional 16 bits would be short we would shorten the IAD, so the interface ID would be from 64 bits, it would go to 48 bits, and the prefix length would be slash 80. So that would eliminate the concerns, which there was a lot of concerns about the race to the bottom"

    "text": "so we'll try to kind of nip that one that we don't have the race to the bottom and then i think the second big issue that had come up in the past was was backward compatibility There is, you know, tremendous a number of devices around the world that are using Slack. And we don't want to break anything So brian carpenter, he had come up with a really nifty scheme, an idea, which kind of it makes sense. And this is basically the idea that he had come up with, which I think it seems like a very good idea, but basically having the network so when you're, it would be very similar to like if you're doing like a router advertisement and you're doing gtpb with, which I think it seems like a very good idea, but basically having the network. So when you're, it would be very similar to like if you're doing like a router advertisement and you're doing JTPV6 and you're, you're a route, you have your your, your, and your, and obit options as you're set options that you're sending in the router advertisement, you're sending the setting bit or O bit for D HTTP 6 so here we're using the PIO options. We're actually here, we're using the 32-bit reserve field, which is not used today, but we're using six bits of that reserve field to send the IAD lane. So, and that basically, it's six bits in that 32-bit field that would be carved out that it would actually specify the actual length And that would be signaled from the, from the, from the router to the host so if there's any so any host that does not support it, they would actually, they would, they would they would ignore that reserve two field and that would kind of be the default behavior that, and that's, that's in RFC four specifies that if, if the PIO is sent and and so any device that's what we call unmodified router so any router that's unmodified that doesn't support it legacy that's not upgraded to support they would they would actually the the reserve field even though it's set it would actually be ignored by the host that receives it For hosts that do support it, they"

    "text": "would actually be able to process that. They would see these, the it would actually be ignored by the host that receives it. For hosts that do support it, they would actually be able to process that. They would see the signaled six bits of the IAD lathe and then they would actually, they would see the, let's say, if it's a I gave an example here. So let's say I, you signal slash 69 and then it's the I the, let's say if it's a, I gave an example here. So let's say I, you signal slash 69 and then the IAD length is 59. So that would be signal in the in the in the reserve field deserve field deserve the the reserve two field would have that 59 bit set in the ID. The host would actually really would process that and build the 120 bits address so that would allow any of any devices that support would work at the at the here, I have a little chart, it's kind of with opportunity consideration. So let's say if you have, unmodified hosts and modified routers, there would be no change that everybody would use 64 bit, of course. And then if you, even if you have modified hosts, and unmodified routers, this instance is signaled by the route no change. So everything is 64-bit and then if you have modified routers that are supported it but then there are no hosts there of course there still would be no change. So the only time there would be a change is if there's modified hosts and modified routers. So you have hosts that support it. You have the router actually supports sending that IED the 6-bit length that's encoded into the reserve two field. And now, you would actually be able to build that longer prefix with a shorter, with a shorter IED, you know, down to 48 bits. As far as the, yeah i am so your time is up okay but I would like to um i believe you were talking about the prior your problem statement that goes along with this in B6A yes so yes i would encourage everyone who's interested to come listen to that in V6 Ops So thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bob So I think we are done So thank you everyone for coming We hope to see you all in"
