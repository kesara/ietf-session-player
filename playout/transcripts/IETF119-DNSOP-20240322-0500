We appreciate it. Okay. Well, This Yeah. The clicker hates me too. All of the usual suspects, you were in our session Monday or any other DNS op session for gone on a while now, you know, who, we are. And Tim is is Tim is online. We'll we'll be here. And in spirit. And all of the, Easual details. He've also all seen the note well.

If you use me, that go to join the queue, even if you're in the room, That makes it much easier for us to manage a single queue and Please keep audio and video off if not using the on-site version. It just contends for bandwidth. And Audio video, the IV crew in the room is making sure stuff works. For remote folks. Glad you could join us. But please make sure your audio and video are off unless you're sharing or presenting. And and and and use of a headset is strongly recommended. And the IETF code of conduct. Again, everybody has seen by now. We're all grown ups. We know what this means. it And Just, a reminder that your your chairs and your ID take this very seriously, We work as individuals, We should be being nice to each other. If there is a there is a line between vigorous discussion and violating the code of conduct. And if you anybody who feels that, That line has been crossed. Should feel free to come to the chairs or the ombuds team. So agenda for session 2. I think we did everything except for for consideration and time permitting. We got to some stuff Monday. The update. We already did the updates Monday. So for today, report on the dentist delegation soft just because a bunch of people in the room are are interested We have this session after the BAF.

As many of you know, I am one of the co others on the original proposed delayed draft. With Tim April, Ralph Bieber, and, petterspatcher.

And so for those of you who have not been following it, what I high, if this is a topic that interests you, the the place where this is now being discussed, because it would be a little welming for DNS opt for it to happen is a new IETF mailing list that is named, dd, that's deltadelta@ietf.org. Please subscribe to that list. We are, the result of the bot, basically, I would say was, it went very well. In that, for being a potentially contentious area ever, you know, the the all the engineering, factions that are lining up on different sides of how we might do this. We're all able to have a very progressive discussion as far as, like, this does seem to be an interesting problem space to work on. We're really not sure what solution should be. So let's start with the purpose of the BAF was to consider the possibility of forming a working group So it's, again, not to overwhelm TMS off about it. And, so the direction that things seem to be moving in now is that, we are trying to settle on the charter for what such a working group would look like. One that leaves open the possibility, you know, of examining all of the different solutions. And that itself kind of stepped ahead of, first, we're going to identify exactly what problems we wanna work on that we're developing solutions for. And, so some wordsmithing is going on now for the charter. That tries to, leave open this kind of greenfield area of saying, well, you know, once we identify specifically what problems we are in scope for this working group, then we can start evaluating what different solutions we might like.

Ultimately, it is a decision of the IV as to whether we spin up another working group, in the DNS area to work on this particular problem. And, The one other thing then I can just say this was not specifically about the buff, but talking to a number of the, advocates behind the delink approach in particular, while we are still going to be developing that in parallel and working on implementation around that. You know, it's our intent to still participate in the group.

I wanna give you some back of your time permitting other people. Sure. I'm Yeah. few But we do have we're inviting, since we do have a minutes, and this was great interest to a lot of people. We were, encouraging others with folks with observations to speak So that's Yep. West Hardaker, ISI and obviously, one of the chairs. I actually did think that it went really well that we know that there's things to work on. There's already a fairly active discussion on the mailing list about the charter. Certainly, you know, the sooner we wrap that up, the sooner we can hand it to the ASGN morning, his crew can make a decision. One note about the IAB review. The IAB is an advisory role to the ASG. So they have no decision. Being on the IAB. Right? I have no decision making authority whatsoever. That's entirely up to the we just try and help look at architectural problems. So but other than that, I thought it went really well due review the current charter. It's in GitHub and and, you know, make it makes change suggestions as appropriate, and we'll get that over to the ASG, and they'll make a decision. Yeah.

Thanks to you, wares and also to one for all the hardworking designs to actually get the buff set up and come out of the draft charter. So we're done for that. The question I have though is when do you think we're going to get some kind of realization as when the the charters got to some kind of, consensus point of view I think it would be helpful to a rough idea of the timeline for that rather than we realize we won't have a a fixed date for it, an idea of how things are likely address over the next few months would be very helpful. Bikes, bikes, Yeah. Yeah, I see you, Wes, and also Warren, if you wanna sort of recap the process. Yeah. I mean, as, Paul and I have talked about it. And, as the the, the interim buff, the interim chairs that the work can go eventually, it'll have new chairs. What we want to see is a discussion happen and sort of peter down and know, if it looks like there's agreement on each of the items and they've come to conclusion, then it's ready for the ASG to review. Obviously, you know, the faster that happens, the better off we will be, we'd like it not to go 3 months long, but my plan was to work with Warren, and I'm sure Paul and I will work with Warren to determine you know, it looks like it's peter down to the point where it's ready for the IESG to review. So, it really, to me, the timeline depends on the group. Not on a hard deadline. Yeah. Go ahead, Lauren. Yeah. What he said.

And so we're gonna send out email asking for volunteers to chair So, also, they're not quite clear what area it will end up being, originally as 66 convinced it had to be in the ops area. But I think I've come to realize it doesn't have to be an ops. We just have to be very, very, very sure that there's strong overlap between the participants and strong coordination between the groups. Ideally sort of scheduled in a way that people can finish one working group and then move directly into the Right. And, Wes mentioned his name, but I just also wanna since Jim had given a a list of thank yous, I wanted clear that Paul Hoffman was also, very important in you know, kind of getting the ball off the ground. And, the one little last opinion piece that I'll offer is that, I know one of the concerns of, you know, the the the advocates that kinda started off this whole, let's look at how DMS allegations are done is, we were really encouraged back at Prague about the number of people that were really interested in working in this problem space. And, you know, was optimist sick that maybe after years about talking about doing something, we finally have the energy and the momentum to go ahead and something. And so one of our concerns at the moment is losing kind of that momentum. But it also doesn't mean we want anything to be a juggernaut, right? Like, there is a balance to be found that we are doing good engineering, but that we keep up the energy and the momentum behind, you know, what the problem that we're trying to solve here. So that's kind of where we are. We're definitely interested in still being very actively participating and moving this forward. And, so far, it looks like a lot of the community is still too. So I'm still pretty optimistic about you know, something something usable and useful coming out of this. Super briefly. Once the charter is handed towards the ISG for their consideration. The mailing list remains open."

I had generally been trying to name new mailing lists that were in support of a Buff. Like, buff dash something, this particular case, it seemed relatively likely that the would eventually turn into a working group. So I didn't call it buff dash something. So we could hopefully keep keep dd possibly. As the mailing list, whatever the new working group ends up being called assuming it gets charted, which I think Right. And that last thing on timelines also was Eric Bank has also kind of pointed out that it should be once it is handed over to the, ISG. If a positive decision comes, or even a negative one, it should be about 4 weeks from that handoff. To, like, please charter something. And also from, warrant. That sounds like a suggestion that, discussion of the Current draft should move to. Should any discussion that hasn't moved from Danasaw should move to D Day? Just to keep it simple, just to, have it unambiguous do get questions about that. because we Strongly recommend that everybody who's currently on the DNS opworking group list you know, and in this room, etcetera, join that as well. Because I really don't want it to be that this whatever this is gets developed in a vacuum and then people surprised or upset. So, so, Hello, Darren. Okay. Yeah. Well, in particular, DNS op is very much, you know, people that are very interested in the DNS. And we are trying to get a lot of cross group participation from the different communities because this is, somebody has characterize this, I think it might have been David Black as the most significant change to the DNS since DNS sec.

So, There has this has been under discussion, I think, for years at this point, and I sat on it too long, but RFC 8624 is a document specifies, the levels that we expect implementations to Like, must should, may, you must do implement you must implement this algorithm. You must not implement this algorithm and things like that. So Warren and I got together and, a lot of at the prodding of Tim, about getting it done this way, Our goal is to move everything to an IANA table. So we'll come to that in a this is not really a biz. The document's actually labeled biz, but it's really a replacement It's actually almost entirely different so today, basically, what 86 24 says is all the algorithm definitions are published in various documents and various these And they're added to, you know, there's 2 INA tables, essentially, And then occasionally, we publish an RFC with the recommendations that say you can see the columns on the right. You know, that say whether they're used for DNSX signing or DNSX validation, and, and whether you, you know, should implement them, should not implement them, must not, whatever. And the problem there's there's multiple problems with this approach. One is updating all of these recommendations is a heavy lift instant you open a document with a lot of recommendations. You end up in a rat hole of the discussion about each one, and it takes a really long time because, you know, you're, you're basically discussing the entire slate again. And, you know, furthermore, the IANA table can actually get out of sync with respect to the recommendations in the first place. I annotable can change. We can add entries, modify entries, And the recommendations table is no longer, you know, up to date with respect to what's actually in the INA table."

    "text": "So the proposed new approach that we're advocating is move the recommendations into the AMN table. And this is basically what this document does. It does not in any way, change the recommendation levels. It's literally a copy into place we can fight later over recommendation levels, but but the existing one deliberately does not modify, which we actually struggled against our self there's certain things we definitely wanted to change. And we're like, no, no, no. Let's get the table update it's make the table updates. So the new goal is basically, then we can use smaller RFC updates to make incremental changes, either to add and remove entries, but also to add and remove or change recommendations as well. And those can be discussed individually, and thus, you know, can don't need to be bundled together is one big thing. So after writing the document, we also wrote 2 short documents one saying, you know, we must not use ShawAN anymore. That's generally why they agreed. And another one that's actually called DNS up must not gossed. And there's actually multiple goss, so that was badly named. That's my fault. And it should really be the ECE Goss in particular, and it and the document actually, the the current version of the document does specify exactly which GOS we're So this is what, it basically does. It adds 3 columns to existing tables, I'll might get you in a second, Mike. We're gonna we're gonna stop here in another slide or so. So there's 2 IANA tables. 1 is the domain security algorithm numbers. And one is the digest algorithm. And so we're adding 2 columns to the first one because that's the one that has algorithm numbers that applied to both signing and validation, and then the digest algorithm is for, you know, c DS and CDS records. So we're just having one recommended column. One thing that I do wanna bring up today, and this is, I think the the largest part of the discussion I expect to have is right now adding a new Adding rows to the AINNA table is only an RFC required."

So something that goes through the ISE or some as AD sponsored or, you know, any of the other paths, We don't want that. So we only really want you know, some types of values to be standards action only. So there's sort of options going forward. We require all changes to be standards but that feels disingenuous with the purpose of the original table Or can make this dual level change. So ignore the text on the bottom because this is easier to read. So the point being is that a non standards action So, like, ISE or whatever, you can add an algorithm, but the only value you can put in the recommended column is May. This seems to be sort of what, you know, was designed originally. And then a standard action can do anything else. You can add something with, you know, any value must should, may, should, not, whatever, and you can modify. So you can modify it upwards and you can modify downwards. You can say, I'm gonna take the may to a must. You can say I'm gonna take the must to a must not. Whatever, things like that. So I will stop here. There's more you know, slides to go in a minute, but, to start off with, There's sort of two questions to the group. One is the general approach a good idea doing, you know, adding these columns to the ion table. I I will note, by the way, that this is actually done in TLS. This is not, you know, the first time to sit down, the TLS algorithms also have a similar column. And actually, we copied a lot of their text because that was far easier than writing it ourselves. So I think first up is Mike. Mike Bishop. I definitely agree with the goals making it more granular and easy to fee is individually is a good thing. I'm a guess my question is how often you expect this to happen? Because there is an actual, like, cost in dollars to every RFC we put out. And if this spawns, like, 10 RFCs a year or just to"

It's gonna happen, you know, once every couple of years, okay, that Since more acceptable, although that's kind of what we were doing before, I guess. Yeah. The the that's a very good question. And and so I have 2 part answers to that. One is the documents that will be edited will be small. So the the cost, you know, that there's a cost per page that's, I think, thrown around all the time. I I expect that making a single change will be small, but More importantly, I, you know, I don't think that the IANA table and recommendations something I've ever seen DNS op discuss you know, on a yearly basis, right? These are long term changes, as was discussed in SAG earlier today, you know, related to its taken. 15 years to get Shaw 1, you know, even out out of the recommended path for a bunch of algorithms. So, you know, we're we're talking takes a really long time, unless there's a massive cryptography break It's unlikely we're gonna make a change on a regular basis, but that's up to the group, right, not me.

I would I would hope that, that other doctor does become adopted and that where that affects this, really needs to be considered. Yeah. There's actually and so we're get it up to a slide later, there's actually 3 documents that sort of overlap a little bit and, and we did notice that one. I think that one's more advisory. And in performational, then than actually talking, you know, and even a more general level. But, but, yes, they should absolutely be a long day for the living.

I, I mean, I like the idea, but I have 2 insurance. One is it's not clear how much text you can put in the IANA registry giving context to the table. You might have to point back to the RFC. And which leads to my second concern, which is The RFC is about implementation not operational guidance. We hit this over and over should I be signing with as well? I looked at this RFC and it says not. They don't understand. So I would not be in favor of this if it's just gonna be the table at IAna because you've lost too much context. That is a fair point. And, certainly, there's always backward pointers for you know, this is where the value came from. I mean, IANA keeps track of that decision. I will say, by the way, I did go to Anna with you know, can you handle a standards action for some values and a Mhmm. And a and a, know, and a may. you They said not a problem. That's not a problem. I'm I'm concerned about someone looking at the table and misunderstanding the context of, oh, this means I cannot signed with this and such. So that could be that there's 3 paragraphs at the top, and some in registries have it. You don't cover that yet in the document. That's right. If it's adopted, I hope that we do. That's fair.

Although if there is if there ends up being sort of quantum stuff, maybe there's a brief you know, a spike of people doing stuff, but that's a problem for future. Yep. Jim. Jim, like this idea is, and I think it's long overdue. So get on with it, please. The question I have though is about how is this high timetable going to be getting dated, we're going to use some kind of expert or euphem mechanisms How is this IANA going to be told to make a change to this will that be done by what can group consensus or what So that is a so that's what this table describes. Right? So it's a standards action to do anything other than may. And new entries that need to be added by you know, the, the same process that goes through. I mean, so there's a good point for adding new new rows currently requires an RFC. A small table, right, values. So we don't do 255 easy come, easy serve. So a a RFC going through any mechanism to get a code point assignment can put a may in those columns. Anything else require a standard section, which means an RFC coming to a working group.

And, we make an up servation, which is that the, the current RFC or the table proposed as he has it makes, recommendations targeted at implementations. Not operational justice like Paul just said. But as a signer, you need to know which algorithms are safe to pick you have a multi signer setup or even not a multi signer setup for that matter, And, so for for for that, to, To that end, it's it's more useful for a signer to have some kind of descriptive a list of algorithms that are usually supported by deployed resolvers. And then pick from those as opposed to looking at a list and then people must implement something, and I don't know if that means that if I pick that, it'll be validated. So proposing to add a column to this, table, which is not prescriptive regarding what you must or should implement or must not and so on, but descriptive about the, support status in validators in the field. And then, of course, the questions how you do, how do you determine that and all of that, fine. I think that's a different discussion, but for example, for algorithm 813, it's probably not contentious that they are universally supported. And, well, I guess 8, at least if, if you don't do that, you don't really do Diana DNS with the root. And, yeah, so If this prescriptive must and the descriptive does people actually, like, offer it for validation.

Right? So, like, how would How would you measure this? And how would we ensure that there are timely updates? Right? If there's if there's a one major validator who decides I'm not I'm not gonna accept this particular algorithm anymore. Then this would need to change pretty fast or else you're gonna have continue to roll out things that don't have universal support. Yeah. So those are good questions, which need to be discussed, I guess. If if the working group, thinks that's a good topic to work on. My take is that it wouldn't have to be so fast. I mean, even if you change the the value in the column tomorrow. It'll take a while until the zone maintain is actually updated. If you require an ROC for that, for example, then it'll take sometime but it won't be very contentious if really large operators turn a certain algorithm off So, But those are good questions.

Perhaps for downgrading only, not for upgrading. I don't know.

So if we just publish the record, and as in the public key of the child and it's not signed and you cannot really trust it in any way. Is very easy to do, but it doesn't really gain any much security. And you can do this in several different ways, and you can play with it a bit and it's still not secure. But If you then, think about this, we actually have some prior arc. And, we do have RC, 8078, which describes how to gain initial trust in a CDS published by by a child. So it's a signed zone, but there's no signed delegation. And This RFC describes how to do this by looking for multiple vantage points, for instance, looking at multiple points in time. And over some period of time and vantage points and checks and balances reach your conclusion that this is actually rather stable. This is not a wine time spoof thing. This is something that we can trust sufficiently because it's been around for long enough, and it looks the same everywhere. And we could probably do something similar here. That said, That's about automatic bootstrapping. And It it's clear that in some cases, you You do want some sort of explicit confirmation that, yes, this is indeed my key, me being a representative for the child.

Like, for instance, the IP address from which the update was sent and we send the update o only over TCP, then well, most child operators would actually know what their source IP address is, etcetera.

We published a key in the child's own. Send updates over TCP multiple times. We verify the source address, etcetera, etcetera.

And, they actually collected all kinds of data from, authoritative name servers of each delegation and also of the name server, names that are given on the child side. So this is parent and child centric if you want. So some basic insights from from the data set. First question for me was how to classify when when, let's say out of 3 name servers. 1 is unreachable. To your account that as inconsistent or as consistent. Now the draft says If stuff is unreachable, you should retry a few times and then eventually give up and just disregard that. Responsive name server. So that's the same as, considering it. Consistent. Or potentially consistent. And so that's what I did for those numbers here. I assumed. That's time outs.

Ignoring the TTL, but including inconsistency from one name server answering with an empty response in another, for example, giving a CD circuit. That's inconsistent, but different TTS we didn't consider inconsistent. Then you find that about 0.1% of, zones with CDS records have inconsistencies and also about 0.1%. Of zones with the readiness key records of inconsistencies. And then there is some Statistical. Variation, I would say, but roughly 1 in a1000. So that's, the first insight.

S 1 dotredactednamesofoperatoroneandnsone.redactedname operator 2, and then also a 2 in each case. And if you query the NS 1, operator people, you get, CDS record with key tag 3714 and corresponding CDMS key if you query it. If you query the names of operator 2, you get CDS record with, QTech."

And, as far as I know, they do not, check consistency in this case, except for authenticated Unsec bootstrapping, which guess those names of operators don't implement and what can happen here, like, the way they do it is, they check for the CDS record And then when it stays the same for a few days, it's got accept after delay. Then they, provisioned the DS record. So I think 3 days. So they do it daily. And if you happen to hit 3 nights in a row, a name server from the same of the 2 operators. You do this resolution, then it will appear the same. So I think the chance of that are 14 1 4th the first step doesn't matter, and the other 2 are like 1 4ths. And then you will think that it's all consistent and you are gonna provision that record. So, in this case, the first of the 2 operators, 1, And, so here's the DNS with, this play and that is, obviously broken. So this is exactly what shouldn't happen, and it could be avoided if CDS processing would do that check that the draft is proposing And here's another case study under .com.com doesn't do any, any, CDS processing. So so this is actually not an issue. I think the zone also doesn't really have DS records, but I found it pretty, interesting that even though this a very large DNS operator. The CDS records across their name servers disagree. So there is NS Cloud B, a bunch of numbers, and NS Cloud 1, sorry, 8 bunch of numbers. And it turns out that they actually have inconsistent CDS I don't know how that can happen. I don't know if Google does the signing themselves. I don't know if this is customer provided secondary service. And I'm not blaming Google. I'm just saying it happens in all kinds of corners. And, dotcom doesn't do processing, but if this was now registered with, I don't know, some registrar who does the process"

There is, initial early ISP, which has, The inconsistency type of problem, except that they are not security. Securely delegated, but if dataL to do the scanning, then there would be a problem and so on and so forth. So yeah, all kinds of dominos. In fact, 90 to 95% of those inconsistencies are because name server or When part of the name server set responds with an empty record set, and another part. Respond with CDS records. So, could be, for example, multi provider setups where one provider uses dnsic and the other doesn't. So that's inconsistent. And, there were 400 cases where, All the CDS record responses served by all name servers in the set for a given domain. We're all non empty. So they all agreed that there should be DNSsec but in over half of those cases, roughly 250 those were actually dual hosted by Google domains and Wix DNS, which, both do DNS And so they didn't do a proper case. K key exchange, for example, so it's not a true multi center setup. It's just, like, essentially two halves of DNS. Like, and The anomalies were quite interesting. Sometimes in the parent, there was the Google domain name servers in the child. And as record said, did serve the Wix DNS name service or the other way around. And I don't know why that is, and I don't know if it's related. Perhaps to provide a transfers or who knows what, but it's within the set of inconsistencies, it's a pretty common one. It also happens with other provider combinations like in the dotch case that we had earlier. Yeah. So luckily, this doesn't often pose a problem, like in the dotch case, because usually those domains are not securely delegated. Nobody does actually do DNS checking. But if automation was done, then then"

So, there was the the the misconfigurations happen at last operators at small operators, Not very frequently, but across the board. A significant number of domains breaks, roughly 0.1%. If, the acceptance checks aren't done, And, yeah, so I think any automation method for DS provisioning should not tolerate that failure rate. That's pretty much it. I think Probably one could extract more stuff from this. This was just from looking at it yesterday afternoon. Yeah. Paul Hoffman, can you go back to the dotch case. This, one bag. I'm sorry. I went further with where you have the data. So I'm asking a question. I don't know if people will be happy with this. But in this case, you've got two answers where you've got you know, CDS, 2 CDSs and 2 different What would you say if you had In the second case, 1 of the d s one of the CDSs was the same. And one was different. So the the RR sets you know, are incompatible, but you had an overlap What would you have proposed that they do for consistency. Throw out the one where it it does not match or give up. So the draft says, when the responses that you get as long as they aren't empty when you get them, as long as there's some time out. And when you get them, they must be equal up to ordering and TTR. So if one part is missing, it is still inconsistent So you shouldn't act on it. Okay. Okay. Anybody else? Alright. Okay. Think"

Everybody's still here at the very end of the idea at the very last session of the ITS thank you for your Yeah. There's a social. It's a goodbye social, so please Welcome over there and see you there. Can catch up with each other. I'd like to thank the speakers. The percentage of the drops, I'd like to thank the working group for participating and giving useful, and, feedback. And see you all in the Vancouver. In July, in July, everyone. Find Yeah. Excellent."
