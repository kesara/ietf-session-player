    "text": "space and so on basically the the whole background of this is something a problem that has arised in in real deployments and initially we filed an errata about this because we thought you know this is something that we can fix by changing one or two sentences in one section but when when we start looking into this and especially when we got the call flows from from the from Network we realize it\u0027s not that simple so this is just agenda so here I\u0027m going to just show a call for showing the problem so far so far it\u0027s so good you have this is a call between a user agent and an application server going via proxy that support session timer you have the invite going you a indicate support for timer indicates that I want to be the refresher it goes to the application server the application server since 183 back and and you get an early dialog and nothing strange there what is important here and you will see that in a while is that the 183 doesn\u0027t contain in a session expires header field because it\u0027s not allowed according to RFC currents it\u0027s only allowed in invite update and and the 200 ok responses to those so you don\u0027t have an early dialog established here but the session timer negotiation is still ongoing now then the fun fun thing starts at some point during this early dialog the application server is going to send an update for whatever reason it is indicating supported timer here and it also reflects the the the session timer it indicates it is the US which is fine because well actually it\u0027s not it\u0027s trying to change the role who is the refresher because when the invite came the ua indicated i want to be the refresher and again the 180 tree never contained a reply to that but now the aes while the session time and negotiate is just negotiation is still ongoing it sends an update where it changes this body it goes through ua and the first funny thing here is that the UAE accepts it to hunter the update but it doesn\u0027t include anything session time and related in it now the proxy when it receives this 200 ok it is going to insert a session timer and it\u0027s going to indicate that the refresher is the USC and the reason why it\u0027s going to do that is yeah before we come there this text you see here is actually copy pasted from from from from the RFC says in a session refresh request sent within a dialogue with an active session timer takes the session expires header field should be present again it is present here in the update but the question is is the session timer active because again it hasn\u0027t been negotiated yet then what as I was about to say is that the UA doesn\u0027t include a refresher in the updates response I don\u0027t really have the "

    "text": "exact reason why it doesn\u0027t do it but could it for example at a UA consider station time a negotiation still ongoing and then what what I said was that when the proxy received this is actually going to insert UA see that that one acts as the refresher even though they ESA don\u0027t want to be that and the reason for that is that the again this is text from the RFC saying that the proxy must insert up session expire header field into the response with the value it remembered from the forwarded request it must set the value of refresher parameter to UAC which is a little strange it doesn\u0027t really care what the value has been previously it says it must set the value of a refresher parameter to UAC so in this case the day it\u0027s gonna cause some problem because now when the application server receives this 200 okay it is actually going to reject the whole invite because of this and the session has expired no sorry this the session establishment has failed and again this is problem and here you can see the whole flow in one slide if you want to I see Paul is in the queue do you wanna do you want to comment on on this flow or go ahead remote can you hear me yes it dawned on me if you go back to slide right yeah go back inside Jacob yeah this one um yeah when the update this is sent by the a s here saying refresher equals UAS mean you AC in UAS and in these messages is relative to the request isn\u0027t it and so since it\u0027s going in the opposite direction from the invite you know a you a yet it\u0027s saying UAS is consistent with the the property of the prior invite that said that yeah you know in the invite the envy of the you a was saying it wanted if it wanted to be is the one that was in charge by saying UAC and and so the UAS is a seating to that as it has to but when it sends the update with UAS in it then it\u0027s consistent with that I didn\u0027t double-check that because I was actually looking at RFC I was seeking the same thing and I\u0027m I kind of casually looked and I didn\u0027t really find "
