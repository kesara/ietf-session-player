    "text": "thank you so as a summary we have a different approach to the FAQ which is easy to evolve into network coding the work is as I said the work is not over we are going to clean it more each more features more coding schemes random linear coding result we want to update our base coat and also include multi packs and network coding so if you have any questions I won\u0027t very fast sure and show you have questions hello it\u0027s Nicaraguan on the satellite axis you can consider 500 milliseconds OGG 20 Meg\u0027s downstream and 5 megabits upstream that\u0027s basically what you have in SATCOM accesses you can change the simulation parameters to 20 megabits down streams for satellite link and 500 millisecond okay thank you thank you we have it\u0027s I was curious about the relationship between what you\u0027re doing and congestion control maybe well can you also go back even one more slide I think that is dislike that as it isn\u0027t it so if I understand this correctly you\u0027re not changing the congestion control or like you working with the congestion all inside quick because it\u0027s supposed to be transparent to that so then we bring only the losses that don\u0027t play a role however is that this is preferred to congestion control okay so how do you ensure that you\u0027re not hiding losses that affect the congestion for response well if if there is a loss normally congestion troll should respond to that right so if you repair all losses then you\u0027re ruining congestion control okay where we are delaying the control losses so if you cannot recover that we don\u0027t pour that loss so we we have one loss we are waiting for the equity packet if we start to receive packets from the new generation we report that loss if not request as received packet okay okay okay I\u0027d have to read the details I guess if you you\u0027re probably working on a paper on this there okay thank you "
