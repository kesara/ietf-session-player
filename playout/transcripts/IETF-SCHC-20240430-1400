    "text": "start again the discussion thank you thank you okay I'm not hearing any more questions so uh yes I mean this is certainly beginning with f and and based on exor and I believe that we need one simple mechanism that is the default and in the future if you want to Define more mechanisms what um what I thought about dynamically using changing the fact is uh if we can dynamically change the the the window size U then and and we say that the last element is is always the F uh zero basically if CN zero um then basically just by tuning the the size from Seven here here to to three or or two then then you increase the amount of fact dynamically and that doesn't have to be negotiated and you don't have to to tell oh I'm going to do two effects in one window or something like that just change the window size could be could be one way oh that's nice yes yeah yeah good point just just one point Pascal on uh forcing an algorithm is not what we did with Chik for example for the RCs we say look you can take the EET CRC but you have the possibility to do something else then it is reflected in the data model so I think mind talking about implementations um I guess there should always be at least one thing that all implementation should have and it's probably Exel because it's very very simple and then the data model could allow for more but then you need some negotiation to say hey both of implementation"
