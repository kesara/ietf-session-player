I'll I'll do just, short overview on the shake documents advancements. So, Actually, we, things have been advancing really well, before the summer, and there have been you know, like, we had a lot of discussions right now. We have 2, active drafts that are the shake architecture and the she cover PPP. It Both of them, I think, are, expired. So we need to submit new versions. On the architecture draft, we'll have some discussions. So because there are some thoughts about, you know, in the in the latest development. So I think that we should reflect that in the strict architecture draft. And there is this new very interesting work that we are seeing that is coming the the the access control, the 0 energy devices, any of the devices. I think that there is a really important part that is coming. And the update of the, 8288 to 24. A draft, and in our charter and in our milestones, we had the, the work about fec Codes we has not get started at, but I think it's time that we, you know, start thinking about, writing something there.

We hear you very well, Sergio. Yeah, we well, I have to do an update on on on 2 of the draft And in the chicken streaming, one of the ideas, we have is to add the the forward ever correction also So we will be doing some some analysis there because we believe that if we send the messages, each message can have some sort of forward error correction so that that will decrease the the need of retransmission. So, yeah, that's what I wanted to say. Thank you. Okay. So that's actually, discussion that we we've have with Bob. So Please keep him in the loop because he's the one who started the the the proposal on, before there are correction as an alternate to the recovery of fragmentation. Yes. Thank you very much. Yes. Actually that's, that's a good point. Thank you, Pascal, for mentioning. So Bob had, some other, like, some other documents on which he is working and he, he asked for some help with the with the shake rules.

Right? We're not a LP 1 working group anymore. And the opinion and the decision was true that it's okay and that we should move it here. Right. So if I understand correctly, now it's a Juan Carlos that is going to click the right buttons Eric, or should we do something about that on our side, I don't know who will push on the button, I think later, so so Eric is coming to the mic. Giving it will be better if the Otters submit a newer version just changing the date, exchanging the name of the So drive for blah blah. Dash shake. And then when they upload, they say they replace this previous document. I think that's way better. So we can two birds, two two birds in one stone. Right? Change the draft name and you you put the right links. I think it would be enough. Okay. Perfect. So we need to, you know, we we need to tell the authors, to to do that. And then we should not, of course, we should not forget we come to the working class call, to do a dual track working on a class call in in a chic and in the interior. Right?

So we issue a version 2, but version 2, because we there are a lot of renaming. So it's it's why it's only in version 2. So we include comments that we have during the last ATF, especially from Bob about making a better introduction of, the document. And we also include some clarification. The document is still not finished. We have also some part to to feel, but it's, it's not so so difficult to do. So next slide, So, yes, so about the organization. So we We are now dividing the document in two parts. So the first one is how to compress, ICMP V Six. For any kind of networks. And then we have another section that focus more on constrained networks. So what impacts the what is the impact of first part is first to design in the young data model, all the field from ICMPV 6, either that will be, define. And one thing that maybe a little bit different comparing to the other protocol is that the payload will also view as a field because, I I see MPV 6, the kind of stop stop protocol, and then we"

    "text": "we can also have to to manipulate, the payload in check. For the over scenario that concern more, optimizations for LP 1. So there is 4 optimization. So the first one is, the divides the device can that can do pings So here is something that we we have to us a little bit, but we had a remark last time from Pascal. I wanted to generate some, huge larger payloads. So just send a sheet message and say, for example, increase it by, I'll generate a payload of, 1 kilobytes to test as a network. So this can be done in a very easy way if the payload is view as a field. Because we can have in a rural payload of, went k young, when we send the the packet, we will send this, this one case. But it's not very flexible. We will ask to put this lengthy in the rural. So we want to see if it's enough, to do that or if we we have to find, over solution. The second thing is, the device is pink. So here, we also add a new functionality in to the core sheik which is to have action, what we call action or global action. So maybe the name is a little bit confusing. We we have restock with, discussion with Ivan. But doesn't it doesn't like the stem action. So the as a net of the action decide if the compression is done or or not, So so sorry. When we rule match, instead of doing comp compression directly, We can call an action. And this action will do things generally on all all the field of, of the packet. And what we are at this time"

    "startTime": "00:14:02",
    "text": "it's also that the reaction can decide if the compression has to be done after reaction or not, And this way, we can have 2 behavior that has been ask the first one is to proxy the ping and if we wait for too long delay. We, don't send back answer. All we send the information to the device and say wake up and send me a a ping. So with that, we can have this, this 2 behavior. So the 3rd, proposition is that she can generate ICMP error message if we don't match, the rules So and the last one is to do compression and, error message that come from the internet of the destination. And we already talked about that, last time it informed a device that there is a problem, somewhere. Next slide, please. So for for action, so global action action, I don't know which name we we can use. I I like action because we have CDA, which are, compressing compression actions that, apply to a specific field, an action is applied to the the packet. So it's now for, ping but it can be generalized to any regular message, the keep alive message, that cannot be sent or is not very efficient to send it on a constraint network. And we can try to to proxy the these things So it, generalization. So I don't want to spoil the rest of the meeting, but an hour or so, we'll have to maybe need it for yeah, air drafts and flows. And so it's not where we return in the current draft, but the next time we will have a better description of actions. For Want to fix something?"

Thank you very much, for the presentation. There is countless, Please call us. Yes. Yes. Hello. Just a comment about the fact that, you're considering adding compression for ICMP V Six, I think this is very interesting because, there may be other documents where this may be useful, because For example, in 6 low, perhaps we might want to be able to compress say, label discovery messages. So the functionality that maybe included here will also be useful there. Okay. Yes. We We don't want to We don't work directly on, I see, NEBAW Discovery. Yeah. But the compression of ICMP can be applied to that. Yeah. Exactly. So that will be already some some work done. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

So I have no more questions. So I, yeah, but I, I think so first of all, thank you for for re restarting the work on that document. So Dominique is remote, but I think there are some major ideas here the major points that needs to that needs to be discussed.

And some of even the the part with deep space communication. I mean, I don't know.

Describing how to use sheik to compress, competitors, also an o score is used and it was all about, providing clarifications, then adding new content about well, cope options introduced, after the publication of 8824, explicit description of, what happens when she gets used, to the cooperative marker, and and also being explicit in describing what happens when co proxies, are also deployed. Was never intended to change, a bit in the core mechanics, of course. But this intent of updating ATA24 was case until the, previous version 1. Of the document, next slide, please. But, actually, already seen version 0, we, we got suggestions and encouragements about considering having a base document, instead for, obsolete 8824, and the strongest argument was to have well, a single place where all the up to date information can be found, and to focus there to provide whatever update clarification addition, to the original RFC. It was suggested by Eric, first of all, and then echoed by, number of people over the months. And, we had an interim consensus, in the July meeting to indeed switch to a base document. So we were just told to get ready for it. And there were no objections. About this. Next slide, please. So that's what we did. And the latest version too that we submitted is, indeed a major, revision of the document, although editorial, I would say there's no breaking change really."

Next slide, please. Yeah, things started to get interested here, in section 5, when it was about describing how she compresses the options. And the first set of information is taken from, RFC ATA 74. With legal additions that we already had in version 1 of this document for the option size 1. It's still proxy URL and proxy scheme. And it'll give match and so on and so forth.

No. So, yeah, I mean, for man, for me, then that's that's good. And then we can, of course, deepen the technique, the the the content part. So I think that the second part will be to develop the same access control for IP and UDP that we have already defined in 87248824. No. Okay. For me, what is not clear and we need the view from the from the group. It's What should remain what has to be remain as a specific document? And what has to be included in the architecture. Because the goal behind that is that to you, when you have a young data model, and we will introduce management we cannot I know, all the fields as a a young data model to be changed. Otherwise, it can be, sick it can create security problems. So we have one part that is very descriptive so that can be put in the in the architecture of the document, but we may also have a normative, part that will be a young data model.

And on the other hand side, probably maybe in the future, we can identify an an additional security related Questions that can be or not related to ACL and so that it will be good that, you know, how we have the opportunity to, like, will be in in in a separate document. And not really tied to the architecture. Right? The architecture should allow for this kind of things, like to say, okay. Well, there is some kind of control if you're changing rules or something, well, like, do making it on document describe the the type of certain? How do you protect against that? But you know, I will not put it there. Yes, Pascal and then, Miriam. I I think you what Lawrence said and what you said, Alex, is not contradictory. We need a little bit of text in the architecture to introduce basically that's the model can be updated. And and which properties can effectively do that, And if, both sides of the conversation have, well, the and say that both sides of the conversation must be updated at the same time in a, way that is transactional to make sure that the the two hands use the same state of the model So so the architecture has to describe that."

Okay, Miriam, Yes. So, thank you for the and I am a student and researcher from the university and, this was so interesting for me because I am also doing research on chief context. And so my quest is that, as I remember, you said that, these are some non change contacts in the co app header, and these are the version type and code. And so just to make sure so we have a different codes in a co op header, which can be included in the method, like that being empty or get or post or sucks sis. The client's error or so we have a various codes in the co op, actually header and also the types and version and so on. And just I want to make sure that so if we are going to consider them as can text, For each of these codes, we are going to have a rates, context, and rule ID. So it means that the number of we're going to save in a device. For example, or the number of rule rule IDs are exactly proportional number of codes. Right? No."

And, Heather's with, behavior that changing and up or perhaps not optimally compress because it will be difficult to to know which is the reference value. And another important point one trick is that you need to know or you need to have a lot of knowledge of what is the application using in 2 different roles. Next the fight. So the idea is to define to analyze how flows are defining this in terms of in terms of the pandemic. They teach the Sorry. How of those, define this, the utmost information, between all the packets in the code, and how they are changing and how we can compress them. And so the idea is also to use access control to obate the information of the target value That's why it was important that work.

So next slide, An action for us has has been defined in OIM is an indication in the rule to profound some operations. So as Lauren showed you for I am, there are some operations that the action we'll make For the flows, the operation will be to to make a derivable rule that deep that that has the reference values from the base rules and that we can modify on updating these values since the flows adults. So we can keep a memory we can, update make a better, an optimal compression of, for example, a sequence number. The IP ID of IP before, the time stamp of RTP, something like that that that today, it will be difficult to compress with one rule. So for that, yes, Just a short question. So, the the action, how do you actually execute the action? Is it like a separate full ID? And when you send that full idea that it does something? No. Pardon me? That that that Yes. Sorry? How how do you imagine that for, or is it like some, some function that's executed when some values are, so how do how do you imagine that from the wire? For me, the action is is an indication in the rule. A rule that you design with an action that is derivable. And now you know that this rule will be used for a flow.

Yes? So so so, so that that means that if use some a particular rule, there the rule will indicate, okay, I'm doing some compression stuff. And then in addition, I'm doing something else else that could eventually create some new rule, a right derived rule or that, like, like, this particular rule could so so just for me to, to, to understand better, you could have 2 rules that have the exact same compression behavior, let's say rule 1 compressing in some way and rule 2 compressing on in the exact same way. But rule 2, In addition, we'll create some action. Let's say, I don't know, create an rule 3 that take some information from the from that that is more specific. You is this the way you you see it? Yes. I represented that in the slide 6. So yeah, it's like, that way, the next slide, I can tell you. So, for example, you a package, you are going to compress it in your sort of rules. You have a role that is has an action derivable, then you know that you have to keep the reference values So you will root you will use these root that is 100 action derivable for flow and you will send it to me, being his sort of rules He knows, I have this, also, that is action derivable. So I have to keep the different values."

I have this action derivative And perhaps my target values are out of the range or I can optimize it creating a derivable road. So I will tell them the other side, I create a rule 101 derivative from the one I sent you before. With the new, with the updated values of the Okay. With values, and so on. And at the end at the end of the of the flow, all the derivable rules will be deleted. Because they are not misused You are only use it when there is a flow. You only keep the base rule, 100 at That's my last slides. If you have questions Laurent has some something to say. Now just to add that this management has to be atomic, means that you need to have the same set of rule, on, both sides. So what is not represented in graph is that you have all the management that makes that are sure that this rule is done by website before but this can be done with quite easily with, acknowledged message. So There is no programs to to this. So, probably I'll I'll have a question here. What what is the cases that you are pro probably you said that, but is there a specific use case and, Edgar has a question afterwards. For me, the use case will be, audio, video, or TCP."

But we modifies the rule to have this set of rule that can manage the flow If it doesn't work, then we have the upper rule that still works. So that's a big difference. We don't put things in in in flows. So the main thing is, for example, TCP where you can have the sequence, number and you just send an MSP on this sequence number. So even if you if you don't have a lot of traffic, you can say, take a very long MSP, and so I I can compress a lot, that computer. And so it can be useful for LP 1. Otherwise, you maybe you compress less and it can be used for other kind of device and you if you have enough space for underlying the rule IDs and you can have words. Lot of flows or so. Sorry. All these, things to adapt. Okay. Thank you Adena. Hello, Aditha Ramos Ericsson. I have a question re related to creating these rules. So basically, that's, overhead on a device.

So what do you mean by new operation? The thing is that I still don't understand exactly what the flow, needs that is different to a normal packet. So then what I was saying is, like, if we could call an operation that could do that, that you want to achieve and and the operation can be whatever can be, I don't know, at 1 sequence, or add 2 sequence to to previous value. And then do the same and included already. In the context. Of course, that would mean, an update and, check specification. But I, I think from the implementation perspective could be easier. Yes or no, because you need to to the most important thing with Chic to have the same context and both ends And if you do it on the fly on a packet, and you use this packet, maybe you have created a context in one side.

This new value that will be, useful to have a more complex compression. And if it doesn't work, then we come back to the first rule. That is not so efficient, but more generic. And then we can create another one. For example, one new seconds number, increase in TCP And, and, you have a boundary of 16 bits, bytes, then when we your value change in the first, 16 bytes, then you more efficient rule will not match. So We will discard this rule and create another one. That will, do with the the new values. So, Because I'm thinking that something based in patterns, for example, So if you know that there is a pattern, can you give the pattern pre allocated to a device and then say, yeah, this is a pattern you're gonna receive. It It can be, so maybe we have to study that, for example, increase the sequence number the target value by 1 because we we know that's the next You can You can do that for the field that has a pattern.

That's the guy who is my cousin who plays football. So the real one And then, my colleague Lawrence who is also working in this draft. Together with this is our first version. I thought to this scrive a little bit the landscape you could do that, next slide. So the, basically, what the draft content is what is, 0 energy devices, we also focus a bit into what are the cellular searoneg devices and what is has been studied in 3 p p. And then also we talk about the lane friendly optimized transmission for this kind of devices. A little bit about the configuration. We haven't got fully there yet. But it started to think a bit. And then the payload compression, but the that is actually not yet gluten anything, so it's for further. But, we we will to also look a bit into that. Okay. To next slide. So first, I can maybe tell you a little bit about the different type of devices that have been thought for cellular"

So what they do is that they buybacks cutter. So back cutter is that they reflect they're singing now. The radio signal So there is a radio signal in the environment. And they reflect that radio signal, do some changes. To that signal, and then with the same signal that they have received they basically are transmitting new data. So that is backscattering. In in here, they are not generating anything. So they are reflecting a device be has some energy storage. So they could actually collect some energy from whatever source. It can be movements. It can be solar, it can be any type. Of of source. And then they also use this kind of buscattering for transmitting. So then basically they will receive a signal from the, for example, base station, telling now you transmit And then because they have some energy storage, they can actually put more data. And and and then make it more rich and even amplify data transmission. And then the device see It's a device that It can generate his own transmission. So if if on RF, and it has energy storage. And when I talk about energy storage, it could be a small battery."

So Then they're having discussion, topologies And the topologies is how these devices connects, to the network or how they communicate. And then the topology one is what we are used to. So, basically, you have mobile phone connected to base station. So this is the same. So an ambient IoT device, connected to a base station. Later, we have the topology too. Where you could have some kind of inter intermediate notes. So something that helps the this device to communicate with the cellular network. So it will be some kind of proxy in between. It might be that, they have different interface. But the interface of the intermediate device to the base station is the normal interface of radio. The cellular normal. Interface. That is what is called the EU interface. The topology tree there is something called, assisting node. And is that, for example, the base station, if it wants device to transmit it might communicate with the assisting device through the normal cellular interface, and this assisting note will, for example, generate Bascutter, signal that will make this ambient device to then transmit"

In my be, that the base station send the signal by scatter signal to the to the device, then the device transmit it, but it cannot listen the answer then there is this assist in device that received that signal and then send it through cellular to the, to the base station. And finally, there is a topology for where basically mobile phone, communicating with the Zambian device. So this will be very similar to RFID today. About these topologies, At the moment in the draft, we would like to focusing the topology 1, is the simplest And there are so many things that we need to consider and they they are not yet defined. Of, how this will work so that we will start with this simpler case And then later if we see that we have the the rest order different cases so we can also take them in a Yep. M Then about the user plan characteristics of these devices. So, basically, what they need is to save they they need to little as possible utilize energy for the transmission. Which is means, every overhead everything that probably use, It's not optimized for the transmission. Is not, It's not good."

So it can take long, very long time. Until, you receive, additional package from the device. Of course, this depends of what is the source of energy and the type of devices. It's the back backscattering device, it might be also different. Another thing is that the type of data they are transmitting might require segmentation. Because exactly you want to try to optimize how much can you send? And you don't know, do you have power to send the whole package it might be that you don't you will only have to send half packet. At least that time. Then you do that transmission and you wait for the next opportunity to transmit the order half And then the reliability is another problem. Because many of these devices also for reception they need power. So not only for transmission, So how this device get to know that the packet has been transmitted reliable In some cases, there could be some cases where vulnerabilities important. So then, we think that, she could help here with some of their reliability features."

This means that if you use a normal protocol, over IP you have to keep, for example, an IP address reserve for this device, for very long time, normal in cellular, you you have an IP address for something like Mhmm. Maybe 30 minutes. Or if you don't use it, after 30 minutes, your IP address change. So then, How can we tweak this. So that is usable so that you keep the ports open. You keep the things over a long period of time over the whole infrastructure. And if we are thinking about over the top, it becomes quite quite difficult because it means that every intermediate steps has to be aware that This is a packet which is delay. So then we have been thinking about this Platinum. Platformization, in a way that, it doesn't need to be foreign operators. It could be also from cloud operate, cloud operators where they will receive this packet. They will be the ones getting the whole thing until it's together in something that can be consumed, can be u be used. And offer it through an API or through an IP tunnel that is created when the packet is reserved, receipt. Like, in the pops up manet, for example, So then, that's one possibility."

These, objects that need to be transmitted by this, by this, devices. Of of if there would be one IP packet. So then basically, what we are we'll be doing is using little bit as a transport protocol. So, basically, we we will use the tile as the minimum size that the uh-uh device can put together to transmit transfer block And then, it will with this, different parameters in activity timer and the radar's mission timer. Then finalize the whole whole object. Of course, this would be more useful for the type see devices. The ones that are having their own signal and they have their own their own battery. But then, the idea is that, they they could they are basically not depending of the timers of the network. Which will maybe clean up a buffer or time out certain connections because everything is, establishing the context So all this will be established in the context. So then the network knows. Okay.

So either they are configure outbound. And it might be that you you actually configure certain kind of context by default. So we we make normative context 1, 2, and 3, and then there's something that, you know, okay, devices context. 1 has these characteristics. Device that we'd contact to has this So but then the issues, of course, how you notify what what kind of context is if I see has So it could be out of hand. You could say, well, this is when you onboard this device in some way, you might need manually put this profile But, well, that's something to think how we can make it to work. And then inbound, there could be some exchange where the network actually brings the context to the device. In some cases, if you think about it, this device might be everywhere. So let's think in a room like this, they might be already 100 of those devices. So it means that the network needs to put parameters that allows to do network balancing. So that the network don't get overload. So the parameters may be quite lenient. But then it might be different side to side. In some site.

I mean, it it's really a very, very a good use case. And, I think it something that, me personally, I would like to to see it advancing, and I would re I I really think it's a very important use case. And I think that we'll see other devices, other type of communication that could actually benefit a lot from what you have to share. I'm thinking about satellite communications where you can have device that, you know, like, right now, with the NTN networks, you can have IoT devices like descending a message once over to a satellite. So it's I think here, we can have a really like, the, basically, the same kind of of tools that you're using. So I'm going to stop talking, the Miriam Go ahead, Mary.

Actually, it's not exactly like that it would need a standardization also on in the 3 p p because be between the base station and the devices, there is no IP layer. So what they use is a mock identifier. So then basically, it doesn't matter for the base station. What is the IP? But then, in the internal network, So the core network of the radio is the one who does the translation from the to the actual IP layer. But then in reality, what we would need in the radio is some fire. For that device. Not necessarily has to be IP. And then the AP will be proxy in reality. So if you go to the slide, where there was the platform Yeah. That one. So if you see the So basically, the IP would be something that will be provided either by the API of the by the IP tunneling. So then basically, the device itself Might not have a real IP. It might be something that the network just And, assigned so that later can do the mapping to the external IP.

So, the goal is to define architectures that is very generic not only, depending on IP protocols, but we can imagine that she can be applied to non ATF protocol. So we have to be at a very abstract labor at this point. That can also be layered because we have for example, in IPSAC in, in coop, we can have several Leurer, Pascal wanted or so for PPP to have the notion of instance ID. And we have also to see how we can include the management in, that stuff. So next slide, Okay. So the first thing is that we introduce also a conservative call it discriminators. It's, let's say, where is the origin of, the package. So it can be, based on a destination and PLS label or connection ID."

In fact, so on the bottom, you have as a discriminator, for example, here we have the source address and destination address. When we have the Shikader instance, that will manage if needed the educator. And then regarding if we have different, instant indicator, on the indicator, then we have different cheeky instance. That depends of this, architecture. Of course, we have the set of rules our totally difference, we different spaces, we have at different levels. So we have no all these rules are totally independent. So next slide. So to do management, which can be glued quite complex. So one way we'll have to be put a bit in the indicator, but it's not So is it to to manage? So what we we propose, in fact, is to define a new rule nature. We already have fragmentation, compression, the compression, and so we can add a new rule that will be, for management. But will be totally independent of the rest of the compression. So it will be in, in court, this own IP stack So we can, for example, have a link local address for identify both sides the application and the device. And inside this type of management, then we will have only compression of, on the way to defines the encryption of the traffic because, of course, when we do management, we have to to encrypt things. So here right now, we don't have these rules. So that will be maybe some"

    "text": "work to do, to to do cock off, to do a duck, and all that stuff. To have some nice rule for that. One part thing is that we don't have to assign a rule ID for the group each the each time you define a set of rules, then you can apply the rule ID that is convenient for for you. But we can have some patents, some, for, for the management. So next slide. So it gives a little overview of what we have when we we have the management. So we have a packet that arrives. Our sheet packet that arrives. So we have the discriminator here that tells you which stack we we have to use. Then we have fragmentation reassembly. If we have, compression decompression we go to the instance, or if we have a management role, where we can manage the set of work. Something when we go to the instance, we can have fragmentation reassembly. And then we can have management So I have some example, but I think I have, don't have too much time to to explain this. So they are here if you want to to look at it, and I think it's good way to to go to the next interim meeting where I we, I suppose, about about that. we will discuss more Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much, Lahore. Any short comment. We are, So I I think just to to drop up the 0 energy device use case, it's a very interesting use case that we also see how it maps with the architecture because it's it's it it just seems like such a big use case And, and and, yeah, it sounds it it looks like a really great work. So we'll need to get back to the mailing list now and then update your architectural documents. From from from this from this Next time to with this, Thank you all for being here, and soon our interim meeting."

Individual contributor on this one. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. Thank you. So, So yes. Thank you all and, see you in our next team. Bye. I have to This session is recorded. I close the meeting just, Is there a button to close the meeting? Yeah. This is I leave the room. Okay. Leave the room. Edgar. Edgar. I, there is working Can you, maybe, one car rolls and You know, just I I think, like, this is such a fundamental documents. Mhmm. There needs to be some kind of an intro to describe the technology, to describe the the types of devices. It's it's amazing that So I I love this. So I would be willing to"
