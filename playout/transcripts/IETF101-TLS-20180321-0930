Poulos yeah so I imagine that the change is proposing is not only introducing that integer and the and the the pinning commitment period but it\u0027s also introducing an implementation that requires the server\u0027s to send a full authenticated denial of exchange or non-existence of the TLS a record which it doesn\u0027t do now there is some authenticated denial stuff there it\u0027s related to wild card proofs and stuff right but not for an X domain responses so that would be another change yes specifically the text about the negative proofs of non-existence it\u0027s very very vague and I\u0027m hesitant to say that it\u0027s complete and okay right now so I think that we need to go to that part anyway so it\u0027s okay thanks I Sriman sir I had some questions on sort of this extension with regards to large-scale rollouts so troubleshooting large-scale rollout so is their ability to turn it on in passive mode is there a way of getting from the clients some logging for example with the content security policy or a tea mark they have sort of reports URI to return information there and then it provides a little bit more signal so we understand that organically this works over time right so I mean that\u0027s something that the clients could passively inspect today there\u0027s no explicit pledge or anything that tells this is report mode versus authentication mode today yeah lines could examine the presence of this extension without actually using it to perform authentication of the server that\u0027s that\u0027s always possible sure but I "

    "text": "a week to think about the captain says I\u0027m not doing this like so from the viewpoint of all the proofs they have already been done using the semi static key to generate the PS k40 RT t even in the first message that\u0027ll be completely fine using it as a Mac key in the certificate verify or be completely fine you can even use it it\u0027s all client authentication that\u0027ll be fine there is a KCCI attack there but it is almost inevitable when you make this from an asymmetric signature based scheme to a more symmetric demon whisky whatever that\u0027s mainly for the handshake at the record layer anybody ever forced so that\u0027s ok but the moment you mix in the key into the key schedule the proofs no longer works so we\u0027ll have to redo all the proofs that we did for that particular case so and I don\u0027t see what the big advantage is for that and I\u0027d like to understand that a bit but I believe that the main advantage is to keep a linear key schedule which is maybe not a very strong one the primary advantage of Sookie go back Lots that the show then the change to change the key schedule for where you\u0027re injecting the key right so the primary advantage of making this change the nominal primary admittedly has changed is not keeping the ER key schedule but is um requiring compromise have both the server static sorry is requiring compromising with a server static and the server run rule to compromise the connection so in the in the current tool supply crate mode you you don\u0027t need you\u0027ll need to compromise the server signature key to come right to compromise that was I thinking and so the not being the same preserves that property and mixing it in makes this you have to compromise call so the long term piece of the hypothesis is say say you\u0027ve had a really bad period a good pair of G\u0027s make your long term key but a bad one you made the ephemeral key then this would be suppose that\u0027s that\u0027s the only run all the work although I think recovering from a PRNG by mixing in additional stuff is not necessary I think you could take a semi SATA key use that as part of your island of a generation and get a nice ephemeral that you could you know hi Tyler phenomena I think you\u0027ve probably already covered this but could you quickly clarify and remind us why we abandoned semi-salic zero entity to begin with and the reason I ask is because at the tls really or not workshop I think some of the car fix work actually raised problems with the zero RTT mode when we still had semi static zero martyt and I know you\u0027re proposing one RT semi static but you also save potentially there are two T\u0027s any static so the question is why we abandoned semi static in tell us the working group I think Eric stated that earlier on it was a matter of it\u0027s potentially duplicative and it was more complex to analyze versus these simple "
