So that we can, you can be able to join the queue and also so that attendance will be, logged, and generally, please make sure that you are signed in and doing the electronic blue sheets. If you are online and you are not presenting, please ask that you, mute your video and audio, to save some bandwidth. And Otherwise, otherwise, Let's go into, what we're going to be talking about today. So, so in furtherance to the working group milestones, again, by November, which is now we wanted to make sure that we were proceeding and wrapping up our problem statement and use cases. Going into the spring, working on a requirement which would then help us understand information models, then data models, and then, the statements of applicability and considerations. A to that to that end, we have a a a good agenda today, starting with requirements, discussion with, Daniel, and then going into use cases and then having some time both, 20 minutes for each of them, but also some time that's been allocated for technical discussion I just to make sure that we we aren't just presenting, but also being able to have some discussion, in the meeting. And then we'll, go from there. Before we start, are there any questions, concerns, or observations on the agenda, any agenda bashing. Alright. Well, with that, we invite Daniel to come up and we can start with our requirements presentation."

This is essentially the second version of the relatively recently adopted document itself notice that we have a number of new participants, with the work. So these are our new contributors. And what we've done is essentially merged some of the requirements and the text from 2 other non working group documents that were submitted and actually, I think both IDs were presented at the previous IETF, but if you look at the diff of the documents, then you'll see sort of some new sections. And I'll I'll I'll cover them anyway in the, in the presentation. So I am pressing the button, but Oh, okay. It's not working. Oh, We went ahead too many. Yeah. Thank you. Essentially, the documents identifies the core requirements that we're then use for developing solutions work. And potentially the data model within the TBR working group, any ancillary technology that we might need for the control play. We also want to think about, some, scenarios, deployment strategies as well. That different use cases might require And I suppose use cases of, unoperative time here. And what we're trying to do with the requirements document is distill those specific scenarios that are documented in the other working group document, the use case document, which I believe is the next pred presentation. Those are split, I think, currently into 3 categories."

And I identified already that we've got a set of core requirements, but then for some of the use cases, maybe it's a corner use case. These might be use case or application specific and not actually sort of classed as a core requirements, So that's kind of something that we need to really think about. Now, the requirements themselves in this document aren't only driven by the use case document. There may be other discussion that we're seeing on the list for instance, where we're actually bringing that into this dark document So we've, essentially assumed that we will have a network, where, loss of link or node is to be expected. Now the way that these network topologies are built, and the information that's exchanged, will be based on, state changes that are either intrinsic or extrinsic. And then maybe full, partial updates, to these topologies. And we will also have, several elements, that will be affected, by potential a schedule. So that will be things like the node itself, a termination point, which may be physical or logical, like a VPN or a network interface card, as well as the link itself. These So apology changes, the schedule change maybe time specific, So time variant. But it may be resource based as well, such as energy.

And I think for TVR when we started the discussion when we had our buff back in many years ago now. I think it's last year, November. Maybe. I can't remember if it's sort of stuff for time dilation these days. We got very excited to buy things like the LEO use case, we're now getting sort of distracted slightly with some of the, deep space networking because that's shiny and that's cool as well. We can get very excited about that. But I just wanna underline, actually, there are several really interesting use case for TBR that are sort of terrestrial based. And we should really kind of look to kind of nail down some of these examples we've got, for instance, sort of power constrained networks, there's yes line of sight as well. There may be networks that effectively have, solar cells, and those regenerate, but it's kind of finite. The amount of power that we can use. So so so let's look at some of the use cases which are kind of much more short term. Keep in mind, of course, some of the longer term and, and, and your time is relative but I think things like deep space, you know, potentially we're looking at quite a significant timeline there. So as I mentioned, we are symbiont, I hope, with the use case document itself, which is coming up and the 3 cat cat categories there. What we've tried to do the requirements document now is expand and detail the terminology. That we want to associate with TBR.

So anyone should be able to read the stuff. Command and sort of, come to the a similar conclusion. So at the start of the document, we really sort of have expanded the terminology section, we then start getting into the TV the TVR sort of specific mechanisms and capabilities in terms of intrinsic extrinsic visibility, locality, temporality, time variability, precision, periodicity, and so on and so forth. Then we kind of move into the applicability of the contracts of the of the schedule itself. You're not specifically talking about algorithmic, application or control plane or mandating sort of mechanisms that would be used to distributes, the schedule itself, but, but we are kind of thinking about that, and that's kind of the end of the document where we start looking at some of the control plane scenarios. We've expanded the routing section looking at the control plane, of course, in terms of architecture. So centralized versus distributed, but maybe something in between. As well. I I suppose that comes back to the the earlier comment I had, which is let's try to sort of find some TBR use cases that are kind of near term.

So, so we've started to think about the different scenarios at scale, and implications, on the control plane. But again, the document doesn't define solution. It's just saying, you're potentially what the requirements are. I think I've kind of covered then most most of the updates we we we have added some functional architecture just just to make things a little bit cleaner and show the functional components and then the interfaces between them. Obviously, I suppose we're only interested in external interfaces, and then we can identify a particular API. We, we did I suppose it's my fault, actually. I probably got overexcited with the documents and started using conformance language, sort of writing the document almost as an implementation from an implementation perspective, and Tony sort of, highlighted the fact that this, this is informational. It's not standards track. So, and it's certainly not an implementation guide, so we don't need to specifically state that something should be sort of should or must or, etcetera. So we'll clean that up in the next vision. We we do need to kind of get some feedback from the working group on how we want to ultimately summarize the requirements.

I've added a couple of bullets towards the end of this present that really talks about kind of security and, and that's something that we really need to kind of think about obviously, some of this technology we'll be in an environment where it's maybe quite difficult in terms of threat vectors, there are very few that that that that may apply to TBR. But of course, if you can attach, through an orchestrator to a sort of managed entity, through the routing application, then you you can do great harm, and we need to kind of reuse existing mechanisms that are maybe, applicable depending on the type of technology that we're gonna use to the exchange the, schedule itself. So this is the figure that I just alluded to. So it really just kinda shows in the context of the documents. The different, elements that that we're talking about and Tony also I'm not trying to pick on Tony here. It's just made several interesting observations, maybe we should reuse, IETF technology for things controller, I think peace PC was mentioned, but actually, I kind of initially thought, yeah. Sure.

I think, you know, that that now that we're also seeing some additional documents being presented indeed today actually from the LSR group, the fact that there are vendors that are already looking at some implementation aspects of t of TVR. This potentially can get very complex very quickly, when we're looking at the the topology, and potentially layering if we use the LEO and I'm kind of breaking my own rule here by talking about a use case, which I thought we should maybe as a longer term use case rather than the short term use case, but let's stick with the LEO. Now add MEO. So essentially you have sort of two layers to your network. Maybe you you sort of connecting your Elio to your MEO or Elio to geo.

Brian, Dan, Lewis, and our contributors, we are referring back to IETF Technology applicable. So these are essentially sort of our topology wherever terms.

Of course, not to be confused with the fact that we have a TBR element, which is an entity as well, but this essentially is our graph. And, as I kind of already discussed when we talk about a termination point. It may be physical, it may be logical as well.

And therefore, something that we can expect in our schedule cool. So we've got node yet link, of course, you know, there are dependencies between these elements as well. When we're, thinking about some of the routing considerations and deployment scenarios. We also started thinking about how do we we need to consider, some of the use cases that there may be a partial updates. Or for certain scenarios, there may be a full update So the full kind of schedule is gonna be published. What happens in that example, like, earlier, where you've potentially have many 1000, tens of 1000 of nodes won't be implementing a full control plane. They won't have all of that protocol overhead or signaling capability. What you might have is sort of some of the sort of the the wireless technology where you've got sort of relatively dumb nodes that are talking to some kind of local node that has a bit more memory in CPU that's a controller has control the capability. That's where you would exchange the the schedule to, and then you distribute that to your local notes. And that that's sort of fairly typical for things like, airports, campus networks, industrial networks, where maybe you you can actually find these networks are quite complex with many diameters, of layers as well.

And then I've I just started thinking about some of the security aspects as well is, and I, again, we use existing mechanisms, but we don't have a security consideration section yet. But I feel it's it's it's very important. Even if it states, There are several mechanisms and, that we can use for, threat vectors and scenarios, but we should also consider that, maybe some sanity checking would be required to make sure that Well, I didn't know, actually, you had someone fat fingers and that's, you move the decimal points, it potentially can caused great harm, as well, and is, you know, is there gonna be a mechanism that will satisfy this check a partial change in a particular, schedule. Good. I suppose I've address these. So, yep. So it's an informational document, not standards track. I don't see the harm in talking about maybe applicable technologies. Again, if we're looking at some scenarios where they're sort of lightweight entities, then maybe a REST API. Something like rest comp may be applicable because you don't have all that state overhead.

We are, sort of lowest Brian and myself with big fans of GitHub, but actually there's kind of strengths and weaknesses at how what what's tended to happen. Because we're using GitHub is that we're having discussion and we're queuing changes to the document and then sort of flushing and publishing a new document. Sort of, just before the IETF may maybe what we need to do is yes continues to use GitHub because it's a great issue tracker. You can see sort of visibility into the the mind's scary mind some cases of the authors and contributors of the document, but we'll, we'll, we'll take an action to kind of just publish interim versions of the document more frequently. Than just having one new document just before each each Iutf. But we found, and thanks to Brian, especially that the automation tools of, GitHub means that we can just use XML, we branch, make changes, assign them to the other contributors and part, and, well, authors for review. And then once they're approved, immediately goes back into the main XML document and it's generated so we can just submit it. Very, very easy.

Again, just thank you very much to the new authors slash contributors, of the documents, we are really interested and can continuing the control plane implications of TVR. But as I kind of mentioned, it may be worth kind of having that as a focused session with kind of scope, 4, maybe it's too early and we just sort of continue to have that discussion within TBR. But it it seems like we might be worth kind of synchronizing, at some point. And we may also want to start thinking about, verification, and, identity management for the schedule as well. And that's that's something that's not discussed in the documents. So we're kind of maybe we're gonna be driving some input now. For the use case document itself. So Yeah. I think that's, 9 seconds left ahead of schedule. And and we have some time built in for discussion. So so briefly, Thank you. And very good to see this edition of schedule identity and verification.

There there's also a a significant discussion in the chat relating to the nature of the management plane and, whether, centralized versus distributed, controllers are are being considered here I know that there was a section on on distributed controllers, but are there thoughts on the nature of controllers as whether they must be centralized not yet. Not yet. It's it's a really it's a really interesting problem. And and it's something we've discussed just just for sort of traffic engineering and network optimization in general, but with the time element, it gets this this additional dimension. And with sort of federated environments multi domain, hierarchical, sort of parent control, child controllers suddenly you start getting into the cat theorem, problems in terms of partition tolerance, availability of data and data consistency, I'm really happy that that that it's maybe time that we kind of have this discussion, but We just need to be careful that some of this is theoretical and is not gonna be deployed in the short term.

Starting with, Zicky, So this is 30 from Qinghua University. And thank you very much for this nice talk. And I just have two questions about this after.

Yeah. It's it's a particular scenario for some use cases. But it's not something we would address directly in the requirements document. I think I think it it's part of the of the control plane discussion. But, you know, we can make it clear that there may be scenarios where the IP addresses use an identifier, and maybe maybe not, in some cases, maybe you we're not using IP. But you still wanna have a contract. You still wanna essentially say that this node will be online at a particular time or an interface. Yeah. I see. Thank you. So my second question is that where you just mentioned the security security problem. And you mentioned that, maybe we can use some existing mechanisms to adjust this process. So do you think there are any new secret problem due to the unique characteristic offers time, very network example, because the dynamic some existing security mechanism may not work if a customer with producing that? Yeah. I think it's maybe a little early to that there are definitely gaps that we don't have the tooling. Currently in the IETF, but because it's kind of a a new dimension for our networks, you know, sort of time hasn't been such a delight you, essentially, we've had in of control plane and management necessarily, and certainly not in the control plane.

Couple of, observation comments. First of all, he, when we go through this schedule based routing. There's a need, actually, to back off from that schedule.

We'll have to several others. Yeah. And one last comment for the the gentleman who was on the the 1. thing is basically Absolutely. That was the ends on the type of scenario. But if you're going on a terrestrial network, the address, it can definitely stay IP. I don't think any, is an issue with with using our ideas in Addressing.

I think it's a problem because this, for me, and maybe I've just gotta sort of malicious or suspicious mind, but this looks like a great way of sort of attacking the network. You've got the capability to actually start making changes on a node that then get flushed or an entity, and propagated throughout the rest of the network. You can do some real damage. So maybe we need to think about the mechanisms and tools that would actually stop that or maybe like a hold off Yeah. We we we really need to kind of consider this. I think it it potentially has the potential to do huge harm, but On the flip side, it's probably necessary for some use cases. Alright. And and, lastly, Lee. Thanks for your presentation, and I have confusion, but, you transfer it. Mhmm. Cost is. So the interest center Yes. It's a a set of customers are in integrated in the algorithm. Mhmm. So I want I want I want to write those serious need for the managerial devices to other warehouses or schedules to the managed, devices. Yeah. Yeah. I think it depends whether or not the device itself is capable of getting the schedule and time information from its neighbor. Yeah. Or if it needs, like, an agent or proxy to provide the schedule, and what what we can do with this document is maybe come up with some examples may or maybe detail them in the use case document that actually showed for some set scenarios, you learn it play from your neighbor, and in others, you learn it through some kind of management agents, a particular node in your domain that can talk,"

So I'm gonna present an update of the use case document on behalf of my professors. So we we have presented the use case document several time. So this time, I'll just focus on the update. So, play will be quick. Okay. So, currently, we have 3 categories of use case in the document. One major change based on the comments we received last time is for the 3rd category. Will change the title from mobile devices to dynamic eligibility. And for this 3rd category of use cases. The major work we did is more editorial changes. Try to act with clarifications more wording to change. To make sure that, is clear to everybody. So it's just a quick summary.

And for dynamic resubility, you know, group is targeted And it it's also no. What TBR or how to be able to describe the change based on our schedule. So for the, detailed use case we added the major change in this version of the document is based on the comments we received last time. We either edit, title network. Into our operating efficiency example. So that's where the network topology change is caused by the traffic come Python. Typical example is you have a campus network. Traffic may the the the daytime traffic and nighttime traffic tightened up. Very much different. And that may cause y'all network to policy change. And the second example we added to the dynamic ability is the predictable, like, movie. Of, example, trains are cruise ships, So you they sell top like, you can think it's moving on your track.

And then so right now, the working group targeting to use a young model to define the schedule.

So, the outsourced guest got together, I have had several meetings talk about, how it marks the draft. So Right now, the the design of the module We currently have 3 modules. In this draft. We have a common module that defines the schedule. And then we have a TVR node to get a module. That's the device model is designed to manage a single node based scheduled attribute. And then we'll have the TBR to polish your module. That's to describe a network topology with time Verint. Attributes. That that's what we consider as a service module. So the TBR schedule, young module defines the common grouping for a schedule. You could This one shows the tree act tree structure of the module. You can sing see that we simplify the start date time. Start time and end time a little bit. We'll remove the always option. Because for the end time, we do have the in finance. Options.

Because we want to eliminate that implementation and deployment dependencies. Because if you are augmenting certain model, Right? Are using the augmenting the links example, you're in that existing model. You will need to implement that model first. And also the another point to discuss is, later I figure out you know, Adrian, Adrian Ferro said that email mentioned the ACR model actually already have a schedule, some sort of schedule defined. So we actually have a meeting scheduled with the officers from that draft. To look at the possibility of whether we can collaborate to look at the schedule together. And, beside that. We have a example in the appendix a way to augment, routing protocol for example, but that's being appended. That because we there's exactly how the protocol react to it, how is up to the protocol.

Okay. I I'm actually I think that's done. So maybe hold on. Let me put it. Here. Yeah. So I think the slide before you had something about power. And I just wanted to to raise a question. I understand that being able to report power is quite useful. But isn't what you're saying here in this particular example that during this schedule, the router is unavailable to perform forwarding or perform rooting in some way So the the fact that it's not powered is the cause of its ability to not actually be able to to forward data. I I it strikes me that within a within a young model which talks about plain variant routing the value shouldn't be Whether it's powered or not, it's whether it can root or not, or not, because there are other reasons why something might not be able to root that aren't power. I can think of use cases where radio receivers radio systems may be in receive only mode. So the device is powered. But it's unable to root, except across bizarre unidirectional links. But I think there's think we're meshing the use case of of, yeah, there are power constrained devices and there are where there are power schedules that affect the ability to root. But I think in the yen model, we be a little bit more logical about this and say, the the option here is we are unable to root not, we don't have power. Sorry. Semantics. I understand."

Physically. Yeah. Yeah. I I think I I suppose my proposal would be that list power schedule, Uh-huh. Could be list functioning schedule. So you're you're you're your bullion is Is it functioning? Uh-huh whether it's not functioning because of power or because of some other reason is is isn't important.

I sort of see your point, Rick, and I would say that, you know, indeed probably to to capture this and add the reason for something. Like an error code, it was something like that on the media XML to say, okay, so if this thing basically is not routing, this is the reason for it. Those 2 big rooms. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. We can actually have, it because of the power? Is it because of, you know, the interface is down? Is it because, like, you know, something like You can augment that piece of, you know, the SMS or, like, the the young model. To to actually be more expressive in terms of why the degrees as state. This is Yeah. Yeah. This. Right. But but but com configuration, if you are you you you can have a later way when we have really, expand the modulator. That's the operation state. You can say what's the reason for this? Not optional. But if you are talking about routing for go to an abstract level. I don't know what's I don't care exactly what the reason is if I can now route traffic I can now roll traffic. But then you because of your electricity or because your latest broken. That's that that that this this is actually nicely leading me to to my next question. Is that what is the what is the use? Just get closer to the mic. What is the relationship between this and the operation? Like, you know, do we actually going to distribute this of things within the, the the network. So right now, this one is 2 defined. This schedule. Right? So if you look at the problem statement, that's That's our first step. We we need to define the schedule And the second step about the distribution of the schedule.

One is do you want a whole new module to, provide schedule, or do you want to augment a different module, to give you the results That's one question. Another question is what elements do you wanna include in a if you choose to do a standalone one, what elements do you wanna include in that standalone one? And you've defined one grouping for schedule, but then you start defining your own elements within that. The the parameters of the link. You could reuse something, like teinfo. Link info. I think that's, defined. Yeah. Will report. Not the I'm not saying the whole module, I'm just saying the grouping. And if you don't use that grouping, you should go look there and make sure you got all the same elements covered. Because there's pieces here that are not. Yeah. So, one major issue if we choose to be standalone. Is, you know, because we define all this modules about our self. Right? Well, there's something that's truly stand alone. I think you're saying a module. Right. Right. And when you'll so for example, when u. Use, in OSPFO and for 12 by PE. Right? So you know how to be able to before right now, we don't have, like, a direct way to might exactly.

To augment tetopology. You can augment tetopology and add in the schedule. Right? That's an option. Right. And I underst I understand you're choosing not to because you don't want the baggage of t e, topology and the t module sort of massive, and I understand that comment. But I'm just saying that that decision is separable from using grouping, existing groupings. Uh-huh. And if you choose to do something completely independent, make sure you include all the information. That is in those groupings. That, I totally agree. That need to be consistent. Otherwise, later. Yeah. Exactly. And and or you're gonna miss something. For example, I don't believe you have everything that is in the of the te link. And that you're gonna end up needing that eventually. You know, for the topology right model, right now, we do use some information from team audio sun, Yeah. Yeah. But what's the in the end the goal wanna go back. Okay. The goal we will have to keep them consistent. Otherwise, they later they become a use I have agreed. And I think it's completely reasonable to ask in the working group standalone, or Auglements. Yeah. Are augmenting. And then if taking the stand alone, what's the methodology to build that stand alone? Because you, again, can take groupings from other modules. Thank you for the good summary.

We wanted to do a simple case. If we were gonna do something like you were talking about where we wouldn't be routing, where we'd be non transit, That would be a different. Case, a different schedule. And regarding the tetopology I'd like you know, the deployments of the tetopology model. To step forward. That's what I thought. Anyway, any anyway, but we can look at we can look at the groupings to see what what things what of that best tree is actually useful. Yeah. We can look at the groupings, but the chance of us augmenting the key module is Jimmy thing. So I'm just gonna come back to AC on this one.

It might I think I say augment. But is the purpose of the scheduled to say when you can and cannot transit traffic through your when when When do parts of your topology work or not work, or is it to talk about the the function of the devices that make up that topology. And I think there's a 2 very different And I think if we start to drift into, well, we've gotta schedule for when the red light comes on.

So just just to reiterate, my my point is understand the description. I understand exactly What you mean by that? That's fine. My question is whether it is the correct property to be talking about within the scope of a topology change schedule. I'll give you an example of something which I think should not be in there, but I could put in there using your paradigm which is, I could say, the blinking green light is on between 9 in the morning and 7 at night. That makes no difference to the topology as far as moving data around is concerned, but it's a schedulable thing. So my question is, Is the purpose of this young module to talk about the apology for the moving of data or is it to talk about the scheduling of things? And I think we need to be really clear about or may perhaps I just missed this point. That that that What is the purpose of the schedule? Because this is I know this is the node module, but I see it as part of TBR. I apology. I and this is where I get confused I think we need to be really careful, or we'll end up with young models that are a big bag of everything. And that's my question. Okay. So, I'll try to ask if I see right there. I understand question. Right. Right. So right now for the, note module. Right? We only have the simple one for just for note power on and off."

And we are, augmenting the interfit. Look at this. Positives, Yeah. Okay. So so so right now, if the see what that topology, I I mean, the schedule model, they only have the power on and off or SPF cannot directly use it yet. So we are not there yet. So Today, the big biggest question is Whether we want to do stand alone volume or we want to do augmentations. And then for that, later, when the when we really write them out, The when this model is about to finish, you will see this how moldy stuff I should use So different things can use you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, pick whatever they want to use.

Where you start to add every single potential property of every type of node as part of that schedule within that module, rather than saying here is the schedule for things which can change on a node.

Chair hat on to answer Rick's question, If you take a look at the charter, you will find that our charter says we should work on routing not LEDs. That said, the grouping that you showed previously back up on slide, If somebody wanted to schedule their LEDs, that grouping should be just fun for doing exactly that. And my one might go ahead and amend things in the interface. Or if it's an LED on a card, maybe somewhere in the hardware error model. That's something that should be reusable. Yeah. At this moment, we have no intention to do any LED related status. Thank you for your patience, Luke. Go ahead. So I think Tony stole some of my thunder. I was gonna say let's go back to the the grouping. I think where the conversation has gone is is that there's interest in a paired down module that, is you know, very focused on schedule.

And that's why I'm saying I don't really care about arguing about whether we augment t topology or not. Those people that wanna augment to eatology can because you've given them the right grouping. So I I the that's the part of the reason I actually chose this small basic one. Yeah. Logical network element. So we we we are not augmenting this, but we try to keep the information consistent. So Yeah. My only question, and I I I should have the answer to it, but I can't decide. I'm gonna emphasize. Is whether or not the grouping should be in its own module. That that sort of that's that's actually what I've read out this way. Ask you this way. What what's your preference? Do you want to house them? I can it both ways. argue I haven't come to a conclusion. I'm sort of leaning towards having it in its own module. Because then it's more easily reusable. Yes. That's that's tricky. Use it even if it's not in its own module. It's a little ugly. So I I I guess I'm right now, I'm leaning a little bit towards module, its own module. But I'm not gonna say that's like, hard and fast argument. So the the ourselves had discussions debate among ourselves, right, whether we want to do augmentation or we want to be stand alone. It's the in the end, we we we turn. And I'm not arguing that. I'm saying there's clearly a use case. Or there's people who want to have a stand alone. That's great. Go do your stand alone. But That doesn't preclude. Having a solid definition of a schedule grouping, which then can be brought in as an augmentation into other modules. I'm saying do that too. Okay. And the question I have, still, and I don't have That was true. That's right. Is should that be its own module? It's all part of the same model. We have these two words that are almost identical."

So you might have your your TVR model might have 2 Yang modules, one of which only has a grouping. Well, Yeah. I I think we can take through the list. Yes. So you are seeing some of the augmentation to the modules. We can have that module also included in this document, but there are separate modules. I agree. Yep. Bhavan Biram, probably going to repeat what Luke said. We do have fair number of top policy models out there. There's The base model is 8345. I don't know why you're 0.8530 here, but the base topology model is a345. You could have just use that that just defines the notes in the links. Then there's various variance of ttopology. This is L3Ttopology. This SRT topology. There are, you know, auxiliary AWS folks who are presenting OSP of topology assets topology. Right? Uh-huh.

As the mechanisms for that. So the this, draft was already presented at 88 116117. So it it goes in the direction of enabling and of path mechanism. Exposing the schedule topological changes. And on how in the in the figure, you can see the the the workflow of what could be the idea behind that So, essentially, we can consider that our operator is programming on schedule changes, for instance, for maintenance purposes, or upgrading a software or removing a card or things like that. So these, the second step will be to evaluate the the the the impact of these schedule changes from the point of view of that of from the TBR point of view, So with that, feeding the, impacts to, and not to celebrate in this case. Or whatever other mechanism that could be able to expose these changes to applications. So in such a way that the applications the users of the network, aware of the the the future changes, right, So probably for with this, they can take informed decisions of, well, maybe injecting traffic from another endpoint or things like that. And then the final step will be the activation once the the time for the changes is is happening. So essentially, the the here is that this mechanism help us as a a purpose for his speck his posting schedule changes to applications or services. So in such a way that the applications or services are, becoming, aware of these routing variations. We position Alto because it's an external solution. Alto incorporates this cost calendar feature that allow to exposed apologies in, in a scheduled manner, the idea will be to leverage on that mechanism for this, off path, way of doing things."

For the other requirements, the the compliance is full or even partial So depending on the nature of the of the requirement. So, Also, we send to the mailing list the question that the the authorized in the previous that you had meeting about the mirrorities with the contact plan. There was some discussion on on that in the mailing list. I I'm from my point of view, this is already clear. And apart from that, a a performance on editor editorial updates. So just a summary of the advantages of that, I I understand this approach could have. So by leveraging in on Alto, possible to implement this offline of of loading of the processes of changes from the network elements. Be an external element, the one in charge of doing that processing. And so Also, we would, avoid some undecided and decidable effects like, the cascading or the propagation effect or changes in the notes because this is something that could I mean, one note inject, you know, a lot of enticing when change could propagate. A kind of cascade effect in the in the other notes. So making all of this, in, in a separate company, let's say, we avoid to to have this escape in effect. Also, with this mechanism, we can easily consider the the impact of a new links or nodes in the in the network. So those that are not existing today, but but will be existing in the future.

So figure one in your draft view put a network digital team here. So can you explain how we can set up this is to change in practice? Well, this is just an example. So the the of the idea here would be to have some kind of, mechanism or tool for understanding what will be the the changes in the topology and the impact instance, in terms of changes on metrics or occupancy of the links or or so on so far. So we put to the network, the the doing as a potential solution, but it will be maybe some tooling, being part of the network controller. So this is just for illustration purpose. So we said, we we put whatever the adult doing as I as a reference for some tool that could help us to anticipate what will be changes or do the calculation, basically, with that generate the the expected new topology.

If we are using, actually, the the the network digital twin, we need to be sure that we have the proper information. So either the current apology could be injected by the network controller or could be retrieved directly from the network. Yeah. Okay. So thank you. So my my second question is that, maybe in your later slides, you have mentioned the advantage of using ALTO thing for TBR. Yep. Right? So maybe you can move to the next slide I can Oh, Take care. And Oh, yes. Yeah. So do you have some And not at this time. I I mean, quantifying the the upload of the processing is, we we didn't quantify it, we can try to do so. For for the other 2 probably, it's not a matter of quantification. It says, a kind of, literate consideration So if you're moving I mean, with this of of path mechanism, it's easy to to to to have knowledge of what could be the the impact on new links or notes. So it's it's hard to quantify is just simply a matter of of the mechanism. And also the way of exposing, you know, so we can maybe try to quantify this. This to be an exercise, but we we don't have now that that such quantification So looking forward to your new results. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. K. Zoom? Out of the burger.

No. I I think that we we could we could use the same topology model. I mean, with Alto, we could we could use the the current protocol, alter protocol. So posting the car rental or network maps and cost maps that are not following the any I, let's say, have a particular format.
