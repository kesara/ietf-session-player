Ito was done here so as you\u0027re as as the the buffer size increases with the oversubscription suddenly you get some loss and then the number of buffered frames before that happened was it was twenty four so that relates to the latency and he tried this with another case with a hundred percent rate and you can see that again it\u0027s you know it\u0027s so doing very well it\u0027s it\u0027s basically saying 24 is the answer again 24 frames kind of consistent but then he tries it with three and now it\u0027s twelve and twelve and twelve so that\u0027s a sort of an interesting case that we oughta be looking at a little differently here that makes another sense thing if it\u0027s if it\u0027s twelve and twelve yeah yeah but this is so this is the sum I guess for 24 that\u0027s right yeah yeah he didn\u0027t he he he kind of he he looked it looked at each one of these streams separately so so this this seems to be the linear case you\u0027re right you\u0027re right all right so now that we\u0027ve come to the new slides that mr. Ito has shared with us so he\u0027s now looking at this possibility so he\u0027s saying we\u0027ve got this buffer all the frames are either going in the buffer or somehow getting out of port for and he says since the test frame also flows to the received port during transmission it is not known whether all the test frames were accumulated in the buffer or not so this is actually the the kind of correction factor I was trying to put in "

Ito proposes that we stop the pause in other words allow the traffic to flow the traffic flows now and now we count the received frames as the buffered frames makes sense let\u0027s see what happened go ahead - it makes partial sense because once you operate with pauses for some vendors it might change the architecture of the behavior of the buffer hmm for particular priorities okay so you might get some wrong results well I think we\u0027re in you know we\u0027re sort of an experimental mode here and and barak gives me a thumbs up on experimental mode that would have been lost in the recording thank you very so we recorded gonna learn things here that we haven\u0027t anticipated maybe more complexities than are expressed in this diagram so here\u0027s here\u0027s the here\u0027s the test and essentially what we what we learned here is the DUT latency plus pause time produces 10 frames for one set of flows nine and nine and the answer is 28 now not 36 so we\u0027ve got a little different result from this different procedure and I guess that\u0027s it so mr. Ito I hope you\u0027ll get a chance to listen to this recording and take this further this feedback further in your future testing and perhaps we\u0027ll see a future procedure on this topic very useful so any other questions comments Burke just a question like I like the previous method to push more like two ports to one hmm I think this is very clean and then you don\u0027t need to make any assumptions about what the behavior for PFC and not for PFC and correlate some stuff around it at least personally I prefer okay okay and and between these two the hundred percent the the dual hundred percent and the one percent oversubscription you know I mean we got two different answers here we got 24 and forty-eight because I guess this 1% really really I mean there must be some there must be some buffer in in this path that wasn\u0027t really getting filled "

    "text": "then the I ppm work have been a simple sort of cross connect loop back here maybe just a cross connect cable mm-hm and and that and with that you\u0027re able to tell whether your test device is able to for example generate all the traffic necessary to fill up a a 10 gigabit per second link and I mean you don\u0027t have the timing problems that are typical because your test device is using the same clock on transmit and receive but you want to know that for example that you\u0027re filling the 10 gigabit per second pipe when you think you are and and as I as I pointed out before with those tests or serrations the the software traffic generator that we\u0027re using isn\u0027t quite measuring up to that so you know it\u0027s a I mean that that\u0027s a kind of a test on the calibration itself right there so I mean it may be it may be too strong to say that in the benchmarking world we haven\u0027t done calibrations because we have but what we\u0027re what we\u0027re doing now is calibrating against against a range of targets so I think that\u0027s a good clarification sadena I thank you thank you for for mentioning that you know the kinds of calibration that are going on today okay and one more question is like you said I mean the the pipe right so a Gigabit Ethernet internet that means normally the provider will give big a bit Ethernet to the first hope router because they don\u0027t have that much because the bandwidth is shared so we have a contention like oh I know one is 220 or one is 200 like that because the the last of from the first router to the work all the users will be sharing a common pipe so you won\u0027t be getting a you know Gigabit Ethernet you know if you are going to the Google server you won\u0027t be getting that so the they always mention like the last last mile okay you have that pipe right then after that it does it as you said like when I you know 25 megabits to the Syrian Network or that so that will be you know testing that will be a complicated right because you cannot simulate all these things in the lab and we have a confined area or we have to use emulators to do that well the there are some laboratories that have that capability there they\u0027re not they\u0027re not in this current phase one scenario where we\u0027re doing this calibration but but labs are out there that exists that have this and you\u0027re gonna we\u0027re even in the production environment where there\u0027s things going on we\u0027re gonna need to demonstrate that at least some minimum rate is achieved and and and very often the specifications have some variation in them like you know they say up to a gigabit and maybe the minimum then they will give in some lesser value so I mean those are the kinds of things that have to be verified with a short test in the field then then you have to be a clear demarcation right oh yes oh yeah yeah because okay this is from this with this point A to point B from B to C or the node B could not see you don\u0027t have that that because it\u0027ll be oversubscribed or "

    "text": "it will be content well there\u0027s there I mean there are there are there are ways to test this where in fact you\u0027re truly searching for the available bandwidth and if it\u0027s dependent on on other users like the mobile environment typically is then you\u0027re going to be searching over a wider range but the first thing you should try is the the rate that that you\u0027ve been guaranteed or the the rate that you\u0027re is part of your service contract so that\u0027s I mean that that may be a very short test where you say you know is this rate available or not and then if you need to search around because because the the access infrastructure is shared then that\u0027s going to take a little longer yeah but it certainly ways to do this yeah because because it takes a longer time and it requires the complexity testing to have this much of slots available or like that because right and obviously mobile is a lot of dynamics dynamicism it scary agree it\u0027s pretty difficult that\u0027s what I think okay yeah thank you thank you I\u0027ll come back Dottie telecom this is useful for internal testing I think and UDP will certainly give better result than TCP but when it comes to the regulator they want us to show that the customer actually get the bandwidth we and advertise including all the TCP and city and stuff and this is a problem I would I would challenge that a little bit because the barrack regulation your DT right the the the barrack regulations specifically talk about IP capacity now they\u0027re now they\u0027re testing tools are using TCP yeah but but the but the regulation which which incidentally your guide and I have you have talked about at some length they\u0027re there on the right target for the capacity of the IP payloads now they\u0027re gonna have to do some kind of correction factor with the systems that they\u0027ve just chosen which do use TCP but and another factor that I didn\u0027t mention here is that obviously IETF is working on the quic protocol yeah and that\u0027s the thing that\u0027s changed over the last five years I mean I mean in five years ago we could basically trust almost any internet access was the bottleneck now that that picture has changed with this introduction here we\u0027ve got some to see everywhere is the dominant transport that\u0027s changing it so lots of things have changed there we\u0027re pointing to reporting to UDP as a actually a more representative thing for this sort of future world and and I think it\u0027s gonna be simpler to test with yeah especially as some CPEs prioritized TCP X for example to account for some queuing issues right that\u0027s right yeah pretty good thanks give your name to our note-taker here so "
