    "text": "and he came up and we talked and so anybody here would like to be a mentor it\u0027s fun so check it out okay so I\u0027m here to tell you about the changes into a 0 DB ripple spec really two things one is we made a technical change to the to the protocol and some editorial modifications and improvements and then secondly i have an appendix in the document that describes implementation in a simulator kuja simulator now I I did not have any personal involvement with the code for the simulator and it\u0027s actually this week should be considered to be preliminary results that should be published or submitted for publication sometime soon but the code from the simulator the plan is to release that and it could form the reasonable basis for other implementations so the main changes it\u0027s a technical specification is that the instance ID in the I is always even it was a previous version it\u0027s allowed to be odd but it turned out to be easier to understand and probably diplomate if it\u0027s always even and so there\u0027s an explanation about that and I\u0027ll say more in just a minute and then the other thing is a details about what was chosen ended example topology and so on for the simulation so on the instance ID in the request message is always odd and as a result of that if you pick exactly the next next number for instance ID or the route reply message then you don\u0027t have to send back the target IP address because it would be the same as was in the route request and when the originator know it gets the route reply it\u0027ll know what target IP addresses about so this is a way of saving space in the route reply but the normal case the route reply is that the weld instance ID for that would be an even number and exactly equal to the value of the route request essence plus one and then you don\u0027t have to put the target node IP address in here but it is possible to imagine conflicts so that the route replies should not have the next number route push plus one so then the new modification is to just say well it still has to be even and then you put set this T bit and when the T bit is set then you do have the target IP address in the route reply so that\u0027s "
