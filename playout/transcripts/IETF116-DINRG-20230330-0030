All the negative effects of centralization. And the second section describes decent and and and nominate some techniques that are sometimes attempt to use to decentralized a protocol and it explores the limitations that decent centralization has.

Is there any particular, like, examples of that that you are especially worried about because what I have seen in the document is that you draw from a lot of examples. Right? Cloud computing Dns. And as an academic I can't help but wonder how comparable and how different they are. And if it's the same type of central centralization and if we even need to be worried about these things in the same kind of way and. To give a bit of a example, for instance for my host drug I'm gonna be focusing on the dangers of central centralization when it comes to cloud computing. And I think a good argument can be made at there are more dangers there than there for instance are in the Dns. But I'm also very happy for you to tell me that I'm wrong that you have a different perspective. So yeah it's a very case by case thing. Definitely.

Which is, you know, we live on a big plan with a lot of people. So that's not surprising. The cloud to me is really interesting. And if you wanna go to the details then I've written about this recently actually a submission to the australian senate of all places. You know, if you look at infrastructure as a service, So just, you know, compute, for example. That's switching is relatively easy in that market. I can go and take my image and stick it on another cloud provider and know that it's probably going to work and it's gonna have a network and, you know, I can turn it on and off, and don't have a console. And so I have a hard time believing that centralization is an issue there. It may be that we have one or two extremely large providers. But they feel the pressure of the fact that their consumers can go somewhere else if they treat them badly. However, there are a lot of service is around that, which are value adding and making it a lot stickier. And and that's where the issues are. The challenge is is that, you know, having briefly been employed to do cloud standards for a cloud company. You know, that is still an area of rapid innovation, and it's not clear that they're ready for standard yet some of those facilities. Yeah and as another point in terms like conceptually thinking about centralization. I I agree with your point that has an to consumer, it's probably easy to move from one cloud provider to another.

Right? That that's... That's not enough all by itself. And we think that that's important in the broader context of having a conversation about centralization, but we also think it's important for the research group and it's charter and we'll ...that's obviously on the agenda here. We think of consolidation as an outcome. And and you'll hear me talk about it as an outcome that's not just an economic come but it's actually a combination of motivations that causes centralization to take place. And here's my slide about that. Our central centralization an outcome really is in many cases in economic reality, we see that all the time. But we argue in this draft that it's also an outcome of protocol choices. And so it's not just a matter of economic and it's not just a matter of economic cloud by a few major players that have economic reason to take advantage of that, but it's also engineering efficiency, protocol design, in reality. The graph towards the end of the draft the draft argues that centralization changes architecture. Think this is a really important thing. To say here at the Ir, it's an important thing for the Ia to hear This is probably not a necessary outcome of protocol design.

That is how design has to evolved as decision happens. Without being intended or even without being necessarily connected with initial design decisions.

So first, on the contrary to reach out, I'm very happy for you presenting this I I I Honestly, I need to digest this document, but I find it we refreshing that you come back on on this about end end I think it it is giving good light to the centralization issues. I I do have a... I would need more clarification in about one slide that that is... And probably this is the In the morning, I think it's slide the nine where ready playing the the requirements of the application provide the base for a class of arguments I think this is this is probably... Would require more more examples, perhaps or or definitions? The thing that's actually, mentioned about email in the previous intervention. And the points you make on the last slide about smart. Interestingly enough, I been I if long long time ago when I'm up and long with design. And the people who are designing it is unfortunately much it's being passed away and but I'm still working with John Myers and I remember be eager"

And it took exactly this example of this off that you took from the on the smartphone, he said in fact, when you look at people normally, you have perhaps hundred people around you want that time people around you that's really here So your address book would be limited you really need to have an exchange with these people or in whom rather now what she do... The make that for is We have the bits are going through a narrow nine are to a highway On that highway where, you've got tools. You've got also sorts something things then you have to rush between trucks and between also sorts something things to get your data And then you come back and you have again all of these things to come back and then you Alright, Cool? Why are we doing this? So I think you really ask an interesting question that comes from, like, nearly thirty years ago if I remember. Correctly? So Of course, I'm concerned about another problem which is security and the unfortunate it's a how can I put that? The unfortunate prioritization of privacy at y spans of security at the moment. Which is a real concern to me because right now we are we are When you speak about middle boxes in this context, it took me a very hard time to accept the that the people who are doing boxes actually And that's the right word. We are attackers two. The code because the protocol refuses us to see security. So anyway, my mind will say, I think you are asking a good set of questions there would be a lot of discussions with bernard. Thank you very much."

Okay. So we have managed say online. Yes. Hi. I I do have a question. So us the computing and the network people are always shut with the fact that by adding computing, we are breaking the m to end principle and I kinda disagree with it, but I keep having people telling us that, yes, because we're essentially, changing headers and you know, putting some computing, we are breaking the end to end. Your position on that? Sure. Question was in which way would in network computing possibly break the end to end principle. I think we're already the other retirement, but that let's talk about that. It's again, another great topic. Exactly Yeah. Eric not Marc. So, yeah, it's a great topic. So I think we've thought about the gan argument in various contexts complex over time, and sort of one of them is where the actual ends given that the computers have gotten more and more dis and sort what are the contracts between different parts of the system message aggregate. Because even in the most simple cases around reliability."

Lives in some network stored somewhere. Using some other protocols. Right? Took clearly, the data that you reliably deliver doesn't actually get reliably stored on that server, it gets stored on. Whatever fiber channel s three, whatever N nfl anyway. Right? So that's that's one of the things that where I think bert Colin point out saying yeah, do we have enough of sort of it. It it's taxonomy a way of actually talking about the stuff And then bringing that into the integrity slash security discussions. Right? And do we know what we're talking about? When is this a? A composition where I fully trust my my proxy whatever. See the thing, because it's really what I consider being the end and the fact that it does something behind it. I don't care. Right? I'm supposed to know It's really posting itself. In my end end conversation, those are of two very different things. So. And I think that that affects for what what we think our end to. I think it's very much policy say this decision. What they chances the city whether not trust maybe that's up to individuals. And therefore we should. Support different policies. Instead of just one. Trust this. And as requires will be able to tear apart. You exactly where the end is. Calling. I think eric eric said lost what those I say. The ends it's back to security and control. And the ends are not so much a physical place as who is gonna control of the covid. Places. And a lot of the issues with the the computer and the network protocols the security model. It is very totally defined currently."

So we now have twenty five minutes left and still two items on the agenda. So Mark, max. Takes on me work and the re charter discussion. If it's okay for you, Can we start with the charter discussion and then see how much time we have? Great. Thank you. Let me Okay. So Yeah. Quick quick summary of the thoughts and discussion on the on the chat so far. So I don't have to talk very long to this but just to go on on the same page, this group has been around since two thousand seventeen and So quite similar to also what not mark cunningham him talked about. Well in the beginning, there was lots of interest in trying to assess the so utility and applicability of of all these decentralized technologies towards the internet. And so there was different types of contributions. On that? And then at some point, well people kind of realized, okay. I mean, this is it's sometimes really interesting research, but quite often more like like point solutions that addresses like a very specific problem. Often these things are not intended to say the the Internet as as a as a whole."

And so over time, we got more interested in like, systematic analysis of of internet centralization and also the discussion outside this group on new threat model, it's and the economic good causes. And so overall, that seemed to be like a Yeah. Really important field that so this whole community F. Hasn't been doing enough on. So there have been some some activities, web workshops, and and so on. But Clearly was more interest and continuous work on. And if you remember, we had this what we found really interesting and and really productive workshop in twenty one. Where many of you participated and contributed and so many good observations from that workshop and and from from the discussions still. Just maybe let's just focus on on the what bottom part here. I mean, we discussed all this economy of scale arguments, but also then the economic really strong economic drive towards centralization. And also the real significant problems that arise from that. And so that kind of... So in the light of of the of the of this focus and all these interest in these in these topics"

Really, in a maybe also should avoid the words centralized, but have like one place in in the Community as a focal discussion point. So where that we maybe than have also more. Say substantial and hopefully impactful work on this. So talk a bit through the Ib. We had the Ib. This week as well. And so our ideas that, yeah know, we want to really simplify and focus charter. Maybe also rename the work the the the research group to just decent centralization of Internet. Research group. And So these were the the the work items that we proposed in the new charter. So just Like, really focusing on on on the like, key items we would like to focus on. So measurements of internet translation and the consequential society impacts. So what's really going on? And how bad is is? Or what what what is is the the impacts. So we think that is will use useful to really make people aware. Right? So... And like bring some ground truth.

Also increasing say awareness now at legislators and regulators and and on. And our idea is also to kind of give them say, yeah. First of all, good information, but also something like like good arrive advice what is meaningful to do what can be done technically and maybe should be done leo in the end. Still we want to, you know, have energy as a space where, of course, we we want to invite new research ideas, technical solutions. So quite often, you know, people know these days dismiss the word like decent decentralized technology and they equated was with blockchain directly. That's probably a bit of an over that is not very useful in in a the research environment. So we think there there's is still interesting work that should be looked at. And of course, I mean, will not be like, one silver bullet it, but still you can learn many things from looking at. So specific you know, proposal system designs and how it could be applied to some of these topics. So the last two points, I mean, I'm went a bit like more like"

So we got bit of feedback and mail today would be great if we could maybe continue a little bit that this discussion. So, yeah, people appreciate that the charter is and more concise and also thought this maybe good to not mention specific technologies. Yes. So there was one comment that said, okay, this should not prevent bringing dedicated technology and but also architectural design examples into discussion. Yes. So that's... What I mentioned earlier. So it's gonna be important for a good balance between the say more analytic work and then kind of constructive proposals on on certain aspects. Some people mentioned that Well, there are different places in the say I ef upcoming some of this the randomization tech is being discussed. And there was a suggestion to kind of whether a dinner can help in some way to be a collection point for for this... I think this needs to be discussed a little bit more because well we think this group should really focus on like, the Internet centralization."

So the the previous focus of the group was, like, too much on on on blockchain and, like, internet translation. It's really too far away from that. So it's questionable with whether a charter would be an honor or maybe we should just start a new group. So we discussed this a bit also was the Ib and miss Colin. And So what I I I hope I explained earlier is that well the idea of this group has always been to you know, look at internal internet centralization in the beginning, it was a bit more say technology solution oriented. But over time, like, at least like since two years now, we shifted the focus to yeah, really tackling the synchronization problem or understanding it better. So we don't think a a new group or something makes a big difference compared compared to charter. I mean, we we have been working on this for two years now. We have the people I think in the group, so seems to be at least far useful to, you know, follow ups as continue with the the charter. And so bit for feedback from the I be review with this this week, which actually I really good discussion. So we I... Yeah. And we agree with that. So we really have to think a bit more about how we actually want to achieve these objectives that we"

And so the Ib, for example, well, has been working on this topic as well because their Id like, programs or activities and and so on. The strength of the Ihs research groups is typically that well, we can have continuous research work items and engage these communities also have meetings elsewhere. And so that The question is a little bit here. What are these communities and what communities are we missing? And in particular, say the whole economics discussion. Could call for bringing some additional expertise to this group. So that's maybe something discuss more. And so these are two points I I I wanted to highlight and they they were few more if if there's anything else, you know, please bring it up. And yeah, with that, we'd like to invite you to share some So additional thoughts, maybe suggestions. Things we may have missed. You would like to see I think that's Alright. Okay. Go ahead.

And I think that was because there was a lack you pointed out yourself of economists, and legal scholars. And having doubled a bit in other fields where, like, working on the conversion, it's very hard to get these people to one place little alone to agree on something. Right? Let alone to model or or provide solutions, especially in the international environment. So how do you think about addressing that this research group. So how do you think you... So are you gonna host intermediary meeting at other conferences invite policymakers or like, what are your explicit methods or aims of doing that or also explicit non ends of doing that. Wow you can see from here, summit some suggestions. To me personally me, I think number one when you direct, we need to explain to others. What the goal of this group is. So that using that the starting point, we dis whatever goal is, to proactively reach out. To those paypal, in economy. In regulation. The very first thing, we need to take first step.

So we we need everybody's input. And so we have the possibility to also do say unusual things and say, you know, for example by... By invitation only workshops or bootstrap things in a... While quick way if you want to say run a workshop somewhere. So these things are all possible and So especially hoping for people who have connections to these communities to help us set something up So I'm supportive of the charter. I think it's a really good idea. I think blockchain really needs to be treated as an example of technology rather than the topic of the research group. So I think refocus the charter is really it a constructive thing to do. And on a personal level. I'm willing to contribute effort in terms of writing drafts for the research group. I think that that's something that a a concrete specific step that needs to happen here, the research group has they have some drafts that it regularly discuss both on the mailing list and in its meetings. So I I think that's That's really important. And that would be something as an objective for San Francisco to continue to do that to continue to generate enough enthusiasm where people are contributing drafts, because I think that twenty twenty one workshop was extremely successful. But we really haven't built on that success. I mean, it was it was very successful. The the meeting report reflects how much interest there is in the topic"

But also, reach out to the people who contributed to that workshop and ask them to be a participant and and to contribute concrete concrete text here for this work research group. I think that would be extremely important. So I'm very supportive of the charter. I I don't agree with the the comment that I think the charter text is appropriate as it stands and doesn't need sort of massive reconsider I don't think that's really required here. Thanks. Thank you. So there was some other comment... Somebody talk to me. And set Yeah. It would be really useful. I mean, just to have this group to yeah Will document like, clear like, mis developments and take issues that that that the Internet creates do to the centralization and the consequential threats that arise from that and to have, like, one group that you know, calls this out.

May I suggest that because I think we're a lot of work in the Ib and that work went wrong because different understanding of centralization existed So maybe but maybe this might be a two academic approach of, like, making a draft with different definitions and understanding almost like literature review str different fields.
