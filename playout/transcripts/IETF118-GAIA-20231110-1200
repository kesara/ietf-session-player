This research group is part of the internet, engineering task force research task force, the IRTF, I'm gonna go through the note well. Quickly. Many of you have seen this all week, but it's important that we go through it again. Just a reminder of the IETF policies and effects on ver variety of topics such as patents, codes of conduct, etcetera. It points you in the right direction, and also there's a note here about the patent policy. You'll see there are, different information here about the BCPs.

If you look at trace routes, you look at latency 1 thing you'll notice, and this is not a and your problem Pierre, and Roderick, Leon had looked at this a couple of years ago. There's some recent people also looking at this, but a lot of traffic still goes to the so they go to it goes to Amsterdam, goes to London, Ghost, Ghost, to Germany, goes to France, a lot of traffic still leaves the e leaves Africa with the EU this has a lot of very horrible.

I think to Africa will also show up, Google's subsea cables have already showed up. So there's a lot of work being done by content providers to create more tables. There is work being done. Also to add data centers a lot of them showed up in South Africa and some now being proposed for Nigeria. And Kenya. So there is a lot being done. And one of what we've been thinking about is that how do we look at the problem from a terrorist drill. Aspect. So I talked about all of the cables coming in. The cables are coming in the side, a lot of data centers that go into the south Africa. We we got content protect the content over the next couple of years. A lot of it is happening in the west, think Nigeria, Yeah. Think I hear it, basically. Mass a lot of content is gonna come there. So then that's the question. How do you get content providers or how do you get data centers how do you get? City and locations there. So the data centers are being put in south most of the content is projected. In the west. You look at all of the data centers that have been put in so far and projected still kind of in the south. So there's this question of what does it look like to actually get connectivity from the south. To everywhere else. I I think you'll see that all of the cables make it so that you basically had to go around one way or you essentially go into Europe. So one question there is what does it mean to add more IXPs? What does it mean to add local or remote local pairing between IXPs and MNOs. Or what does it mean to add?"

It's unclear to me. Are you saying that Local traffic goes through Europe, content is in Europe? or does the Local track, both It depends. Oh, So local traffic goes through Europe, because of the way pairing is set up. It's often easier to pair. I guess if you take a step back from a historical perspective, most of the pairing and most of the content most of the content was in Europe. All the pairing was through Europe. We've gone forward at several decades. A lot of content is still remote. In Europe, add when there is content local, Sometimes it's it's often more cost effective to go through Europe. And so I feel like just like you're a buff filled. Was also baffled when I found this out. At first. I think, the first papers by Pierre where 8 years ago. And it hasn't changed significantly. I I Can we go back one slide? Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Thank you. I think what we're saying, like, if you look at the cables here, a lot of that initially was just South Africa. To Europe. And then initially Nigeria and Kenya to Europe. Now you're saying why, Google trading cables. This way medic ready cables around this way. So there are a lot of cables kind of going around So the problem eventually ship that there'll be more traffic, stay local. It's not gonna be going. Terrestrial is gonna be going all around. So"

Based on what's changing right now, there'll be more data centers here. Some other clip that might end up coming down here. But the question here is how do we get content? In other places, and also how we can actually get traffic flowing. Within the continent itself. Next slide, Now, And there are multiple people working on this idea of trying to keep traffic local. And the idea of keeping traffic local is booked. Getting content providers to show up. In different locations. Getting more terrestrial cables, getting the IXP themselves to pair. ISPs themselves to peer. Differently, and there are a lot of different ways. Different solutions. And the question is how do you incentivize providers to show up. How do you decide which policies are better and more importantly, how do you try and reduce the overhead actually having people show up, in different locations. And I think My thesis is we need to reach out to rest your system. It's not just my thesis. I feel like, at this point, everyone else, I've spoken to that goes to in Africa, period, summit, or that shows to that shows up to either Nigerian or the South African pyramid or the Kenya pairing. I'll have the exact him idea. So I feel like At this point, This is not an original idea. And yet there's still this question of how do we actually realize it. Next slide. So I wanna make one random point. I I think from an academic perspective, And whenever I talk to people, not too familiar with the continent. I think that this question of how to improve things. And one point I wanted to make is the consignment is not Muddl ethic. I don't think one strategy is gonna work everywhere else."

So when I say different regions, I'm just thinking of 3 Countries KES South Africa in Nigeria because it's a the big countries where a lot of people are focusing on right now. You look at them, but from a user perspective, they use using different browsers, the network has different profiles. And also, the traffic is also a little different. So we're thinking about strategies, it's not gonna be a one size fits all. There's gonna be a question of focusing on individual regions or individual countries, but that was one points that I wanted to kind of make in terms of, we're trying to get data, it's not Let's get that there from a bunch of random places. It's basically it's a focus on individual locations and try to get a bunch of consistent data, from, you know, one country from one region. Next slide. So What I'm trying to get right now is data from the data plane. So think traffic matrices, think counters, think usage patterns, trying to understand, which content providers try and bring to different locations, trying to understand how do we rethink protocol? So the past, I've done a lot of work with quick, and you'll notice Oh, I've noticed that, performance is based not just on the protocol itself, a bunch of are the factors.

And then, you know, is a bunch of control plane data that we already have access to that we can use to analyze the routing but I believe that we need data across these three spectrums to try and think about how do we make reasonable change in different countries. And as I said, much of this is basically a call or a cry for help. And I'm kind of open to try and think about what are the data, how to get the data, and more interestingly, how do we use the data to try to convince different stakeholders to change how they're engaging in different countries. Can you explain what IXPDB is for some folks? They may not know. So I XPDB similar to PRDDB. A database where, Ixp's Either opt in and provide some information on the user and automation tool that provides information about the PRN information and and roughly about their size, end.

Also, a lot of change is inspired by large content providers who I love because I love Netflix and Matter. But it would be very interesting to think about things. From the end user perspective, not just in terms of 1 large content provider what do the end users themselves need. There's a lot of work to do digital transformation of services,"

Of My pet peeve It's not just one solution. We're gonna have to break things up and try and think about either region specific solutions, our contact to wear solutions, and I'm trying to get a lot of data put active measurement data and passive measurement data. Need help with everything. And I think that's That's it. Excellent. We have about 6 minutes for Q And A. And I think you had a question earlier about why some of the traffic wasn't was not staying local, If you don't have an internet exchange point, sometimes your traffic isn't gonna stay low Right? They were tromboning their traffic. Subsea cables in a lot of African countries. And so it would transit through, it would go through the Subsea cable, come through Europe and go back to have 2 ISPs talk to each other in the same country. So, but by building an internet exchange point in country, you're exchanging traffic totally neutrally over that. Fabrics. That's clear, but I would be interested. I'm sorry. I can, understanding better what are the obstacles to doing local peering Are they social? Are they economical? Are they technical? So I I think I'll let the above, and this goes back to this to make sure there's no one problem also. So there are some places where they're no IXBs. There is a dominant ISP. And so when you're using that dominant, ISP, you will basically use whatever routes it uses, which is to go through Europe. In some other cases, when there is a content provider location, there, the content provider location isn't just what Ixp, what ISP."

I I think kind of going back to what are some of the underlying issues, some of it is trying to find ways to create communities. I I think you look at US. We have Nanook. That happens in like, every 3 months, a little operator show up and they talk and they try and find ways to do parent, or you look at, In the EU, there's every country has a bunch of these think the question is, how do you try to change the culture is one of the things not there.

I think it's going and trying to replicates, Not replicate it. But find ways to create some con conducive culture to more cooperation. Yeah. No. I think you're absolutely right. And, like, there's the IEPG and maybe network operators from Africa could come. Cause I think at the end of the day, actually the operators, the companies that telcos in Africa probably have different in, in my view, probably more interesting problems to solve than, like, gigantic multinationals, but that's just my assumption, but we won't know until there's more engagement So, anyway Right. So I think Okay. We have 3 more people in the queue. Okay. Yes. Yes. Alright. Alright. So I I think Got it. Yeah. Can we do speed round? Like we're not gonna get them to come to us. You look at 1000 last last last 2 months and next month, there was a huge period summit in Ghana, and there's one in Nigeria and there's one in South Africa, and a lot of the providers had to go to all three of them. And they asked the question, well, if you went to Ghana, why wasn't why do you have to go back to the next country? That's next door. Because a lot of the providers will not show up. Don't have the budget to travel. So, basically, if you're I'll let up the operators who still have the budget to travel.

And, there's been, as I mentioned, kind of a growth in this idea of connecting it longer links. So basically you'll have a long haul link who sort of a least fiber or something like that that can cross multiple countries. Long distances and create pairing environments for networks that are not actually next to each other. But sort of from a a network perspective, look that"

Then so the reality is, of course, traffic goes over multiple ISPs on its path to Minneapolis, but from, the IXB's here perspective, It looks like just ran off. And this is a growing phenomenon, especially in in in Africa, for this kind of, tromboning issues that we had mentioned or that, that Theo mentioned earlier. So this is sort of a, a bigger issue that we're starting to see. There are connections from IXPs in Thailand, for example, all the way to Europe as a single hop And this can, confuse some elements of of the network structure, and so this is really a place for people to talk about the pros and cons of the space. And why why this is happening and and what the sort of positives and negatives are. So kind of, I'll start with this. Does does anyone wanna add anything to this definition is I've given it. Yeah. We have a challenge with the definition of remote peering because some of our members also pointing, like, you know, link between Prague and Vienna, which I mentioned before is 1 millisecond. And for some company, it's, appointed, like, remote peering because it's a foreign country, but it's a it's a 1 millisecond, which means in City of London, you have data center, which much more farther than 1 milliseconds. So I think the remote period could be a little bit challenging for definition. Yeah. I think, I agree. That's one thing that came out of the email discussion on this was there is like, like, the benefits of remote hearing for smaller ICP is when they're remote hearing with kind of each other in the sense, that,"

But that's obviously very different than some really long haul links, that we're seeing elsewhere. Any any other additions he would like to make if I may, I think it it it is very similar to what you just said because it's, because we we should highlight the the existence of resellers, in this market and a lot of pairing goods for resellers, and I think if I'm not mistaken, the if you're using a link for the reseller, it's it is considered as a period, as a remote pairing. Link even if you're within the same region. Maybe just a question from me, rather than sort of adding on to the definition And I think it will be good if we could make a distinction between IP transit and remote pairing or maybe to explain what I mean further. You have provided us of IP transit. Who will receive prefixes from their downstream clients and allows those prefixes most of the time at another exchange point or at various exchange points around the world, providing the IP transit service how do we differentiate between the two and, yeah, I think it would be interesting if we could be able just clarify at that point. Yeah. I'll say from what I understand, you know, the distinction is that is really at the BGP layer, which is that IP transit, the multiple ops, the network. Are included in the payment so that that"

Because I think we generally we, in this part of the world, are more familiar with IP transit, and that's what we are sold on a daily basis. We have IP transit providers calling us all the time to offer a better deal. But I have never been approached by anybody offering remote hearing. So that's I think the context within which I was coming and I I would like to sort of connect that to the comment that Amrish mentioned where talked about resellers and this is where I would probably see that confusion of the gray lines coming in in that an IP transit service may be you know, presented. If I may use that terminology, as a remote pairing, but is it really remote pairing? Is there a commercial difference the way it's happening out there in in other parts of the world. I guess this sort of number is the question that I was, is there, Like, what are the differences from business and technical perspective for up between sort of traditional IP transit and these remote peering arrangements.

Something, hopefully, my question apples sort of classically done. And my appearance had very similar functionality. Why would an or station choose to remote peer instead of a traditional IP transit arrangement. Okay. I can try to go first. So, usually, IXPs, especially the big ISPs or are quite appealing as a, as an entity because they are they have so many different peers and, usually contact networks, amongst, their peers, and and they might not or they might not, you know, pairing with the local transit provider, in, let's say, an African country. So it makes it very appealing for for smaller ASPs, let's say in the African region to remotely peer with the bigger IXPs out there. Because then they can easily have access to the big group of, the ASMs or the PLS and and mostly content providers in a as as the goal to to reduce the the latency to to connectivity, actually, to to the end users. Okay. We have"

One is costs for if it will cost me less, through a remote peering arrangement will be able to get better visibility on the internet better diversity in terms of my prefix. Let's call it the whole routing management Right? Then that's an advantage. But I think probably from a, a point of view of a ISP that is a country like Malawi. Which has very, very, very poor infrastructure and very little in the form of content delivery networks the closest CDNs sit in Europe and in the Americans. So through remote gearing, being able to thereby abscess. You know, a much wider range of or even just even have primary access. To CDNs to be able to thereby offer a better quality of service and optimize other more expensive routes That is also definitely a appealing proposition. Yeah. We have also a few members who are using remote peering, which is sense of just more than tens of milliseconds And they typically are the gaming company who wants to have a coverage for some reason, So for example, then they develop"

To have a little bit more controlled than just buying IP transit. Just to add on lately to this, when you say control, what do you mean? I mean, At at at certain point, they have, some definition of latency. Which is between Prague and, remote destination. It's typically fixed. And if somebody, it's, something happening on the link, It's a changing just in small percentage. But if it's ip there could be few re routes and the the parts can be different in the time. And so there's just because it's a lease line you get some SLAs that you don't get over. Tobias, do you wanna jump in? Alright. Oops. So, to be a Swedish, doing stupid things and running an AS, with also a lot of funny remote pairings. And one of the things you'd see, for example, is that you have things like GP Global Peering Exchange by, 174. And, well, if you can just get any form of tunnels slash looking to you. Like, it's actually layer 2 to a location where there's an b you just can put a switch that is a whole lot cheaper than getting any GRT fault full type of capable device, like MX 104, MX 2 or 4."

And, like, those switches also usually take a lot less powers power is also something which is an MRC for you. So you basically get the same latency a hot glass and, the same being at the So it sounds like is here is that it is cheaper to do these remote peers rather than IP interconnect, Again, I would say classical is that an agreement with everyone? It feels weird to me in the sense that, obviously, you're using Brian, go ahead. No, I think you are making a point. I'll let finish, then I'll come in. I just wanted to add a disclaimer to my enthusiasm. Oh, sure. I I I I think my my point is complete. I think, like, that cheapness is, is something that's, it's something that has always drawn me into this question because, again, it's like the same physical infrastructure, but this, like, overlaying this causes these changes and we'll get I think to a little bit of the problems with this from, networking perspective from a broad routing perspective. But this has always been really intriguing to me that it is cheaper. And trying to understand why has been a goal. But, Brian, go ahead muted yourself. Sorry. Yeah, so I think for me latency, That's the keyword. And this I would say is a major concern or issue"

    "text": "that would probably compromise to a certain extent the participation of especially networks or ISPs that sit on continents like Africa or in countries like Malawi, which again have difficult. Infrastructure issues or are not connected to high speed pipes. For example, right now, I just did a ping to 8.8.8. I'm getting and I'm getting the 50 milliseconds to 132 I'm sure if any of you do a ping to 8.8.8 on your laptops or on or devices, probably get below 10 milliseconds. And that just is a very good reflection of you know, to a to a significant extent how latency plays into some of these things. So I think the question then would be you know, if we were to try and say we would like to encourage more remote pairing for networks in places like Africa, we would need to find ways of being able to adjust some of the specifications or requirements. Around latency or find ways of optimizing the latency. Or cushioning, against that latency Yeah. Yeah. I think so. If if it's cheaper and faster this sounds like a good thing. And, obviously, the the ISPs, that are a little bit more Frontier will will appreciate those benefits. I'll say, I want to lately speak now to the sort of downsides which are somewhat religious in nature, at times"

The attends, when those ASNs are hidden, in the hearing, then it's much harder to guess what route is the quickest way somewhere? And so that's one problem that I've understood. And then at an even higher level, there's a feeling that some of these peers are really causing centralization of the Ixp infrastructure. Which is to say a little bit to what Amish was saying earlier, of how, this allows for kind of centralized places for CDNs. Everyone interconnects at Minneapolis here. In the US, and the infrastructure goes in there so that the, you know, the IXP is incentivized to get as many eyeball on their stuff as they can and to have as many peers as possible. Even more than, you know, their physical infrastructure, I should say physical network sort of layer 1 network underneath can, can ostensibly handle. That it looks like they're basically the center of the Internet. More remote peers just makes it look better for for the kind of metrics that they care about. Are these real problems? Is this, you know, me as a networking researcher being an us about, kind of silly stuff, or, or is, or is it just something that, like, you know, centralization is, was is a repeated theme across a lot of infrastructure. And as much as it's harder for network like Brian's, it's, sort of inevitable and and just how how things grow. So question to the ballots. And in the audience for that matter to bias, I thought your comment was wonderful."

    "text": "So Yeah. I would like o Go ahead. Is someone speaking? Okay. So now I would like to to jump on the, on the latency issue. Yeah. Yeah, definitely when you you do remote pairing, you reduce them above hops between the source and the destination. But it doesn't mean the latency is reduced. Because, you have speed of light, of course, limitation of speed of light. And And the fact that the the the EXPE is hosted, let's say, on the other another continent. Definitely the speed would be much, sorry, the latency would be much longer than if you had to access content from a local ixporhilocal Internet service provider. So it doesn't mean really that you will reduce your your latencymon. What when do you reboot appearing. Udefinitely would reduce the number of hubs. When trying to reach the the other destination. But not necessarily the neat latency. Another thing I I would like to to say is that, and you rightly pointed out, Curtis like we do not see, all the EShops in in the bath necessarily, in in remote peering. And this causes complexity in you have to debug your your your your network profit. Right? So if you don't know which topic is using and and where is the bottleneck? Then, it is sometimes very difficult to troubleshoot. So it adds I I think it also adds complexity to traffic engineering ultimately. Yeah.

So, I would really only be speaking from a third world perspective And of course, yes, things like latency is an issue, but Another big challenge is skills human capacity. Right? Is a big problem. In this part of the world. Even today without even connecting to an internet exchange point, you have ISVs entire networks that are still running with static routes, lots of static routes in there. No IGP. No dynamic routing you know, Sometimes, that is the biggest barrier between them even joining their local internet exchange point. For period because They don't know how. They don't have the skills. They've given sort of do this, do this, do this, these other requirements. You need your own s number. You need your own block of IP addresses. You need to have BGP and configure so that it can be able to peer. You need to be able to put in your BGP filters and configure them in this and this and that way. And, you know, they freeze. So a barrier as opposed to a downside. And I think it's also important to recognize that there may be some barriers while remote theory might offer a lot of advantages, and may really be a great thing that can help especially networks like mine coming from our region, there are some barriers that stand in the way.

So they can decide if they bring in them new value with the that the remote peer or they just can do quick reconfiguration and get rid of all our remote beers. Tobias? Yeah. So, tobias, again, so so I'd like to get actually to that point of getting rid all the remote peers because, as as you said earlier, there's a question about whether it would example, for an ISP in Malawi, not be better to be at a local IT speed. The thing is if the content happens to just be in Frankfurt, it it actually might be better for them to, just have a remote peering to D6 because then it's Basically, you know, Transit was extra steps, while the local ISP gives them other local users. What would help is if the local ISP would also have a local Google cache. And then latencies would actually get better. That is something we probably have to keep poking people with, like, the Google things on their batch like, you have to do this. You have to do this. You have to do this. And then sometimes they will do it. And apart from that, it's like, yeah, kind of transit with experts types. I mean, I think this really comes back to what Theo was saying Yeah. kick off top here.

So you set up these remote peers, to Frankfort and the like, and and that just sort of, you know, resupport what's, or I guess reinforces the is the sort of model of of the internet. Sounds like Tobias would like to add on Yeah. Sorry. Be because I actually, kind of remember what's my first point was before you brought up the community, which was like Brian's point about, we are lacking knowledge, which brings us to another kind of remote peering, which is a network community, really. Really? Really? Really despises, which is channel peering, like, you know, all the kind of toaster and, washing machine IX piece, which are, like, remote tunnel only or are, like, the law kicks in and, you know, you have a Yolikoto record. Couple of switches. But the thing is it actually helps people to do things with BGP and to do things with in an environment where it's a you know, kind of break everything for the AS. Well, they don't have ipv6 at home. Like That is bad, but, you know, you don't have, like, other people that don't have ipv6 at home because of you. And there I see this a role of remote peering because technically, especially if you have, like, not a Dock cover connection or a wave. It's it's all over tunnels, right? It's just somebody else tunnel and the NTEU is a bit little bit larger. But, then you also have, like, this this impact of this kind of distracting on actually building abilities and letting people run things. Greetings Malorie's comments.

And and in terms of trying to potentially resolve this as a problem space, A question for the panel. Yeah. I believe the centralization is occurring because of the placement content. Right? So if content is centralize to some extent on only on European IXpeas. So there's a preference for for some content providers to place their caches in big, IXPs because of maybe competitive prices and there is less of a market value to place them in smaller expertise in Africa. Then this is where, This is where the centralization is happening and it kind of forces the hand of smaller ISPs In that case, not to choose, not to go with the local speed, but it said to go for local pairing. Sorry for remote pairing. And therefore, yeah, it doesn't contribute this the fact that remote pairing is available to some extent is that is not contributing rein reinforcement of the local pairing fabric, I would say I don't know if, Brian would agree with me Yeah.

So for the foreseeable future, we we do see it it we we we we are sort of stuck in this place where we're damned if we do and we're damned if we don't. I would say that we need to figure out a way of sort of striking a balance between boosting and promoting the local Ixp and figuring out ways to improve the utility available, and it's great to see that some content providers. Have actually embrace this by offering edge options. So you have cloudflare. With the pangea, option. That have a sort of scaled down version of their traditional CDN node that they can put into a frontier network or into a remote location. Just the other day, I had a very interesting discussion with Netflix Regional Head And, you know, we are trying to get a new Internet exchange point up in the long way. The capital of Malawi.

I guess that would be the only additional points towards Ambridge mentioned that I put it, put it, put it, put it Mallory? Mallory Notal, CDC. So I don't wanna be too reductive here, but I wanted to compare maybe policy possibilities that would be an improvement over some of the other trends we see. So in in Europe, as well as in India and Brazil and places we see an increase in policy that requires data localization. I think it's for a similar purpose. But, actually, I think coming at this problem from where we are. Presents a potentially better solution, which is it's not about user data. It's about the the hosting of services. And so one of the problems Well, one of the opportunities actually is, You have banks. You have government services. You have loads of other kinds of commerce. Happening, on the continent in country, and that's getting hosted abroad. Whereas the government's the government's government policy has a lot has has an opportunity to incentivize rather than penalize, like, in the case of fatal localization, incentivize companies to host in country.

It really if we're talking about a draft a potential something that guy might do, keeping that sort of policy, maker in mind while it could maybe helpfully be helpful and instructive in addition to helping the protocols and standardization part of the IETF also weigh in and optimize. This situation. Thanks. Thanks. That is a really great thought. Thank you for that. Like, I'll I'll add on this. I think Tobias, if you wanna come up but, I'll I'll add lightly to this thought, which is like, I think there's still this question of whether this is a good or bad thing at the end of the day, and whether Gaia or anyone wants to take such strong stand to say like this is a problem to be fixed I think you see from Brian that there's a clear value in it to certain ISPs and like saying that this is just something to, like, choke out, because it's bothering the internet architecture, is a strong stance. But I don't necessarily know that it's the wrong stance either. So maybe just continued discussion, but once we make that decision. I would love to attack this sort of policy setting. It's really interesting of, like, you know, requiring peering with just neighboring countries as an example of something that could be put together pretty easily. I easily, I say in terms of, like, you know, thinking about it 5 seconds at a panel. Tobias. So, I think it all boils down to what Bryan said, which is capabilities, because if you look at where stuff is hosted within Europe or within the US, Well, the answer is usually ec2 or, well, Echer, Echer, through a lesser degree of Google"

Well, maybe at first, but you will notice as soon as it's not anymore. So so, like, this whole marketing thing and this whole belief among policy makers that this is how it has to be, which has also been contributing to the erosion of capabilities. So now we have a region which is lacking according to Brian, a lot of capabilities and Well, if we then have people there who have accomplish to get these capabilities, what would happen to them if we are already capabilities here. And we have higher GDP, we would just go over there and be like, hey, do you want to make four times the money in Germany. And then we again have less capabilities there. So we need more capable people, and we need more capable people everywhere, and then we can talk about hosting locally. Because we're not getting that done within Europe as well. 5 minutes left. And in that last 5 minutes. Any any other sort of stuff from from the audience and other stuff people wanna add If not, I have my final question. So a way, like, think there's an interesting tension here in that often these discussions are centered I on, things like Frontier Networks.

I don't think I asked that very clearly, but, hopefully, the panelists can interpret. So My two Tambala. The Tambala is the Malawi currency equivalent of cent. My two Tambala would be I would see remote peering, especially for many countries in Africa as a bridge towards a better future. So I think that the whole world is growing. We are all growing together. And the networks that we have today the networks, as we know them, are gonna look totally different in 10 years' time. We may not even be having this conversation. In another 10 years. So I would say that optimizations that worked today may not be the same thing tomorrow because the rest the continent is growing up. The continent is catching up.

And, it goes along the line with the the depth of transit, which is actually happening. And even if it's not the if it's not the case yet in Africa, it is going to happen as well.
