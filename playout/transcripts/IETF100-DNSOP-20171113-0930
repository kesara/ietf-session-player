Hoffman and I can take notes for you while you\u0027re talking including the big pink box slide edge yep okay so hi I\u0027m Paul Hoffman I am presenting for both Andrew and cousin Horry terminology biz has been around for a while next slide I have the power which of course the first thing I did was point at this screen because I guess I could do this which would be just equally as dumb so I think pretty much everyone here is familiar with the document we\u0027re keeping it going we\u0027re sort of hoping that at some point we can finish we did the O 7 draft in October what has been happening in the last few drafts is we will get one or two people to say oh and I want you to add this or can you change this one little thing we do it but we\u0027re not really hearing much from the working group and so some of this may be ok we\u0027re all tired let\u0027s finish it and so what we want to do today is introduce some things to do one last push and then go to working group last call what I would hate to see happen is is we go to working group last call and all of a sudden a whole bunch of new issues come up that could have come up before now so we you\u0027ll see in the next couple slides we picked and choose some potential real issues which maybe no one actually finds to be issues but we\u0027re going to go for it anyways and then the idea is that once we\u0027ve talked about this a little bit we will ask for working group last call and just then cut it off for those of you who aren\u0027t familiar with RFC 77 19 which this is abyss of we\u0027re starting to see more and more adoption of the of the definitions "

John\u0027s timing one you know when is it safe to revoke the oldest trust anchor keys and sort of there\u0027s a there\u0027s a timing question of do you measure it from now as if I\u0027m trying to do a sleep until that right time or do you measure it from Purdue you define it as a wall clock in other words at this date in this time so now the current document not yet published contains both the and then the the other big question and this is one of the questions I have for you today we don\u0027t have a lot of time so I\u0027m only asking really two high level questions one of which the second one is there is this notion of network delays and retries and failures cause you know the time period that you must wait to be longer and so the question is the math gets of course more fuzzy when you add in this you know flexible time and there\u0027s the the current document you know has a two times an hour type thing plus a little bit well that\u0027ll be later Mike st. John\u0027s suggested a much more complex thing based on the retry integral from 50 11 which ends up being an e did I lose it again come on hello no it\u0027s not it has nothing to do with that I haven\u0027t moved it\u0027s the Mike doing so now I can nope that one\u0027s not working either we lost all the audio entirely oh there we go yeah that\u0027s not good and so somebody might want to notify the audiovisual crew because something\u0027s definitely broken anyway so Mike st. John\u0027s has a fairly complex even more complex bit of math to base it on based a safety factor on the retry integral from 50 11 and do so many retry intervals depending on you know how many resolvers are out in the world and you know whole log end kind of approach I won\u0027t go into the math but that it actually made sense I understand why he picked it the end result is the wreath at the the safety factor could go up to something like 28 days and in the minimum case if you went with that approach so really quickly one of the things I\u0027ve done is I restructured the document so this is the old version and all of the timing is in there and there\u0027s all these math and so to talk about the the piece where I broke down the document into the math terms are now "

PICU this Eric person yes I was gonna say something similar to what you said and I hate to disagree with Stefan but I think the security concern is something I was going to jump up and say something about and in general I think it\u0027s probably ok as long as you define these codes you think about what sort of advisory and what would actually prompt you know a security action in other words if I get this code and it\u0027s gonna cause me to retransmitted or make a decision or whatever then yeah the lack of authentication is a big deal if it\u0027s something that\u0027s you know evidence that just you know gives me an indication just think that through is you define the codes I think some of the codes might be more you know reasonable than others but to just disagree with the TLS thing that\u0027s transport security and this is about like a sort of an object so they\u0027re they\u0027re probably composable but I\u0027d say that they\u0027re they\u0027re kind of different so I wouldn\u0027t try to use transport security to secure an object like a Datagram that comes back that has its own lifetime in caches and whatnot after that so there\u0027s my two cents now very good very good thought thank you Eric Robert yeah Robert story is I I was actually thinking about this on the on the previous slide and you keep talking about an error what if it was air of flags if you\u0027ve got a 16-bit ID or 32-bit I\u0027d be ID\u0027d split in half you could have so many flags that would let you have multiple error codes well so the reason that we don\u0027t have flags because and we thought about that for a while but the reality is we expected to find more than 16 so the number of flags gets very long and we could do things like the weird insect flagging you know where you skip large sections of zeros and stuff but you know the question is this which is better more flags or you know when you may only define one or two or more error edie and s0 blocks which take up even more bits so that\u0027s a that\u0027s a good point Joe I\u0027m Joe Eppley I\u0027m confused by what Eric said so I think I may be disagreeing with him but possibly I just don\u0027t understand what he said I should buy him a beer but seems to me could you repeat all that and a little slowly and more loudly okay echo is driving me it seems to me that what we\u0027re talking about is exactly transport and not objects by definition objects are things in the data model which assigned at the place "

    "text": "so I encourage you to go there and and I think that process is supposed to be open I was hoping that I was hoping David would mention it but anyway so there is actually a particular discussion on names collision that is going to be happening at ICANN Stuart Cheshire from Apple I have a quick comment not so much directed at you warned but towards several of the comments that were made in your presentation you you made this joking reference I want a pony repeatedly and and you pointed out that end users and organizations are doing this already and we sit here at the ATF bearing a heads in the sand pretending it\u0027s not happening and pretending we can stop them I can only assure ports show widespread use of dot home and dot ARPA we\u0027ve already had this little dance at the ITF where we pretend dot home doesn\u0027t exist and we call it home got Harper instead it\u0027s not too whether anybody outside the ITF will care about that they\u0027ll probably carry on using dot home so people talk about problems with referrals and mergers one use case I view for this is bootstrapping you buy a new piece of hardware out of the box and this is the default configuration if you have a domain name for your company that is registered and paid for every year you don\u0027t need to use my company name com DARPA at dot internal as somebody else suggested because you already have a global unique fully qualified domain name that you can use for all your names this is for the product you buy on the Shelf in Best Buy and it doesn\u0027t know what your domain name is and maybe the first thing you do is configure it but to configure it you have to talk to it and talk to it has to get on the network so there\u0027s this bootstrap process so I think there are use cases like that that are valuable and even though it may only exist for one hour while you\u0027re setting it up that one hour could be very painful hour if you can\u0027t get the device and you\u0027re pulling out serial cables and vt100 terminals to configure this piece of hardware that\u0027s what a wonderful use case makes perfect sense I guess what I\u0027m still struggling a bit with is how you know it\u0027s something like that internal would be different than dot local or anything else that\u0027s been put into the the specialties names registry you know there is an effort underway that\u0027s as Edmund mentioned looking at name collisions but that seems to be somewhat orthogonal to this so you know I don\u0027t I don\u0027t actually think it matters so much where the work is done you know if it\u0027s done at I cam that sort of suggests it\u0027s only sort of DNS related and it\u0027ll take a lot longer than probably people would like if it\u0027s you "
