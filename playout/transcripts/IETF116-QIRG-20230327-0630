It's also about how can we apply instead of new research in quantum fields, how can we build the ecosystem, the ecosystem around startups that transfers, community building, It's also about training the workforce for the future. Because we think quantum is of course, important will be big and therefore, we need more people from the academic, but we also need the hands from other institutes to build the machines the hardware and the software engineering. And not to forget what is the impact on quantum technology on the ethics and and and all the other discussions about society and the new technology. And we have also invested in the National clean room, infrastructure in netherlands also not only for the nano environment or the photon area also for the quantum area. There is a good clean room of required. To give develop the technology and everything around this. Go to the next slides. This the foundation sort up by leading institutes in the quantum area mainly concentrated in the delta area around q which the collaboration between the two delved and the applied russia's organization do know. Around q and a quantum focus area in the Amsterdam area focusing on the quantum applications and algorithms and this institute is driven by the university of Amsterdam and the the center of mathematics.

And I think this slide not that well working in this set up of presentation in mid. But it would have proposed an overview what's happening on quan technology in netherlands and that was also published in the media. Like developments of the first quantum link in two thousand fifteen on the campus of the european of del in Delta, of course, the setup of the quantum alliance where the netherlands is driving this alliance in the netherlands to come to repeated technology, memory standardization and many more. To the first entanglement links and developments around teleportation technologies in the quantum networking field that are driven in the Netherlands and where we have a local corporation in global. If you move them to the next slide, as mentioned in the introduction of Quantum delta, we're working on initial program and in the program network the development of quantum technology is important in this area. So also, in this program, we have to go to strength developments of quantum networking in general and quantum technology. The goal hope to build a national network to connect a different quantum locations with the first generation of technology. To link uses to it from the academic world from the telecom infrastructure but also from the end user perspective, it could be from a governmental area. Offer on banking area or other industries that wants to work with quantum network technology wants to do some experience on it. The national test will be also to do something with the cloud infrastructure, mobile networking,"

And the main activity there with key distribution technologies to protect the data on classical network exchange the keys on a quantum network But again, with the provide a solution on the classical infrastructure that is out there. And that's the two directions that we're moving on at the moment. Move it up to the next slide. So the main goals of the quantum program in announced it comes to to networking is will built a fundamental for national network set of different test beds and show showcases will come later on in this presentation. Focusing on the hardware and silver developments and not forget standardization and there's also the link to this event that I'm now presenting on. Especially around the heart or development, there's a lot things going on also. The fundamental part, but also warmer on the applied signing product. Product site and the software focus becoming more and more important. I think also is important for the end user. Perspective. And did develop a couple of a use case applications.

That will accelerate the developments from the netherlands in incorporation with many parties gold. Move to the next slide. Then the goal of the cartoon program is split in three. We have couple of test networks, R and d networks running in the ein open area. And in the adult area, that was first starting with development in the Dell area to test and to experiment with the q technology And now you're working with that same network on the quantum, technology And in the ein area, the R and d technology is built up to test in different use cases and difference. And user solutions. And the goal is really to drive this developments only R and d network networks and if it's becoming a bit more mature, in in the end transfer it to a stating number of the Phase three the staging network is a goal to build a national network between these different locations. And there make sure of stable environment where connect all the technologies or all mitigation zones and play with the other application both application and technology own that stable test calls, the and all quantum staging network. And if we are successful there, and then we have the goal to transfer it to... We call the quantum network of Construction support where industries that are interested to work with content network technology, we can provide with information with experience, but also if they're starting with working on content network technology technology, we can loop the experience back from the industry two the developments on a stable network called the conversation network"

I'm moving up to the next slide? So the main goal is done the National Quantum stage network, as I explained I set in the Delta area and I hope you can see there are small of yellow lines where we have different connections from the belt to the city of Dell, the campus Ariel the two delta to the hague where we have a big important telecom hub there. And nine hole there are different R and D connections at the moment to the automotive campus and to the smart house Campus where we can protect data streams to these different areas. And then the upcoming years, we will start building up the connections between the main suit the main hubs aren't del and maybe more to develop at and build a stable network. Move on to the next slide. Then one of the cases that we start working going in the ein area is how can we protect the the data streams from and to a base station of a mobile network that is connected for instance two five or sixty and network.

And build up the experience on these different solutions and user applications. Next slide? And then moving much more to and the developments going on in the netherlands. Especially in the Delta area the t of corporate with latino has worked for a couple of years on the development of Md K, red sentinel and difference distribute nodes that connect to the center node and where you can exchange the different keys from the sentiment or by to the other locations there, The development was mainly different from Q has was tested in two thousand twenty one the Network on r part, all the Gateway network in life environment and there we have shown that can protect with this technology different video streams from one to another side on the classical network.

Then on the next slide, we made a next step to euro fiber euro five is also one of the biggest fiber operators in the Netherlands with connect connectivity all over the place connecting all the mobile networks or photo also have a lot of cross border networks to Germany france Belgium Luxembourg. There we build up again again qb technology from different operational data centers where we connect three locations at the moment in in the central. Part of the Netherlands in cooperation with Juniper. Also from the... The developments, there wasn't spin out at the moment that called qb, and they are commercial and product pricing the Md technology at moment. The difference compare the previous setup in the K environment is this is really in data centers that is are fully operational that are hosting also so many other critical parts of the infrastructure and that the fiber that was used also was bundled with data from other operational environments there. So this was set up in a complete open environments from euro five and also customers of the fiber are able to work and and trigger and and and test solutions on test in the area.

So a couple of years ago, European commission said that your entities with the goal to accelerate the developments in the member states and last year, all the twenty seven member states were able to build a proposal to build their first quantum networks in the particular European countries that are part of the Eu. And it resulted in twenty seven proposals where there were difference in maturity and experience, especially in counties like the Netherlands in Spain in italy, there's a lot of developments around quantum q technology there. So they built more at phones proposal than other countries. But smaller countries or big accounts that have depth month experience in development of quantum technology they're working close together her at the moment with other members states that are more experienced in these fields. And the goal is to build these national networks there but as a follow up, the European commission will start pushing to build a across warner developments between the different member states. So an important initiative there's also push by your commission to to focus on variety developments in Europe, so that there will be an industry build and make experience build on this technology within Europe. This is one of the big part developments, if it comes to the first generation quantum technology, but also there developments that are linked to the cons that alliance to build into technology to from the content flex.

Our requirements where a quite systems between quantum classical information. The same drivers. Flexibility to include incorporate components develop outside such as future content memories. And support for than multi user operation. Our approach is to take a layer at detector with centralized Control. Inspired by software support defined networking. So with the couple control and data planes define several management functions such as routing and channel assignment, dynamic of path establishment, calibration and optimization functions. You will use at the end to orchestrate all the all optical pickup switches and would wave and entanglement photon sources. That we would have did network.

Basically, many of the comments are things to Rodney and V for the latest comments on the version thirteen and fourteen. We've addressed we think all the comments in the new version fifteen, which has been sent to the mailing list.

So a big shout out to all my colleagues submit possible. Including v over there. And so let's begin. What do we want to achieve with this? Project or what did we want to achieve? Basically, you have we have variety implementations of quan networks, but we will mostly be considering entanglement based bunch of networks that have the generated entanglement through what we call a head mechanism. Where there's point head station between your two nodes and the station communicates whether the entanglement attempt was successful to the No. So this is brief mentioned, but it's important to understand couple of things later down the line. And what we also know is that we have a variety of one to network test beds around the world at the moment we'll be using reusing one that's been also used for some demonstrations in in a lu and we know over a bunch of prosecutors for quantum communication, specifically in what we would call the data plane.

And we also would like these the resources of these nodes to be allocated according to some policies and demands that are dynamic. Throughout the operation of the network. I think this is fairly we can fairly agree on this, and I don't need to convince you on the importance of having programmable networks and nodes. But in in the context of quantum networks, these calls and requirements bank in a lot actually. So I will try to map these goals onto like, simplified view of a network.

At the same time. To make it easy for you and for the paper that we have written in our experimental evaluation. We have only focused on two nodes And also just a subset of all these beautiful obstruction that I have talked to you about. Obviously, we have a plethora of nodes in the lab, but I'm just giving... It was just a first step towards something like a global network, but or we had available at the moment was two nodes. But we we still think critical result. And hopefully, this will open up the automotive experiments. So a few details on of on our implementation. Basically, actually just one slide back. One moment. Again, Our goal was to deploy some kind of networks stack on top of a couple of devices. And to run some simple applications. Networking application. As for the network stack, we have taking things from Literature. We have... We know that couple of four years ago, a first link layer possible for working was proposed and just one year later network layer across. Was also Suggested it,"

One key objective that we had for our stack in General, was that the the way or the the timing that the two nodes would be following to entanglement would not be computed locally or at least or even like, agreed by the two nodes suddenly, because if you deploy these two notes in a larger network, and one now one now connected to, like, multiple of them. I don't think it we don't think it is fairly easy. To for the note to compute a schedule without knowing what's actually going on in the notes that are connected to it. And if these now that also They have more neighbors. This is the the nodes they're considering. So And least conceptually computing a network schedule with a global video of the network. Would be best than the control plane. For that implementation, this control playing was some person. Manually computing the schedule, just to demonstrate the concept. But so what the schedule looks like and is bunch of time slots. With with the second resolution. And each time slot tells each note what does not can do this in this time slot or specifically when it comes to When dung generation what which of its neighbors or m. It can connect to that specific time slot. Just be aware also that"

So you only know when we'd like to start entanglement at network stock mayor, but then the actual trigger happens at the fiscal layer. We deploy our control stack on two nodes, and actually close over this slide in the interest of time a little bit. Is remember is two hours in a university lab So just spaced by a couple of meters. Not that much. So we'll go into the evaluation of this. To summarize the again goals applications that we want to run, these are very simple quan working primitives. Specifically, we try to generate in entanglement at various requested. Given that the underlying hardware actually has this capability, you can ask for a certain fidelity in a range and this gives you a trade off on speed versus quality of the entanglement? And we'll be looking at... Also just simple fidelity or the time state is the quantum performance metric and the latency to deliver in entanglement so the request arrives. As classical metrics. Also ran a couple of more applications, but we we're not gonna talk about them today. The at the application layer, we make use of this software development get called that cas.

And then we'll be measuring in various spaces on the two nodes. Which we call client and server here. So this is to do some kind of on the internal state. The body of the application looks like following at the bottom three lines basically, you create an entanglement with your neighbor, you are performing a rotation to read in the basis you want you measure your... Your end the q. Looks easy. Right? And it actually is. So this is one of the maybe hidden in achievements that we what I to share it with you, can easily program your underlying network. Or your note by writing a simple python application at the moment Clearly, the possibilities are limited by the Hunger. So you cannot run whatever fancy application with mo business you have available, but whatever you have. You can actually call it up. And that's it, basically. I'll be sharing a couple of results.

That's a great so this is mostly dictated by the performance of the huddle itself. So Yes. If your hazardous does not capable of delivering any that is done. That's not up to your control stack, but at least even that our hardware is capable of doing that. We were able to demonstrate also with the software stack deployed on it. If we look at the latency for delivering entanglement, you can see that it is mostly dominated by what's happening at the physical layers or the actual entanglement generation attempts. The higher fidelity, the more attempts you need to achieve entanglement clearly, And as you see this the latency, the physical scales, kind of exponentially with the requested fidelity. And as you can see, also, there's like, a bit of a added latency overhead coming from we call it link layer protocol here, but it's basically the working working so the network stack. And where is this coming from actually? Mostly, if you're on the right hand side of this slide, you can see that if your entanglement request arrives in the middle of a time slot the designated your network schedule then you will only be able to start in time attendance. At the beginning of the next time then. Is for value reasons, but basically, it is to ensure that both nodes are synchronized and start kind of at the same time.

That is specific to the on the lines of the stack. And if some if the compile has knowledge of the physical platform and it now is that some fidelity cannot be achieved.
