So we need to establish form of tunnel and the form of session. between the endpoints, and we need to identify that resource. the endpoint so they can start compressing and decomposing.

We are considering the regarding the session establishment, we are considering how do you locate and trust the rules that use for this session. So that's why the architecture is growing quite a bit, and that's why we will have session on it today. Next slide, please. So the smooth transition that you saw for those slides is exactly what's gonna happen with this working We are smoothly transitioning from Lp1 into shake. So my expectation is unless there is opposition for that, but my expectation is that will be closing shake with 8441, 8442, I'm a bit like sorry. I would be closing at you. And I see sorry. Sorry.

So we there is also ICMP generation, it means that IP the sheet core can also generate some ICMP messages to save it. there is an error. I don't find this rule or I cannot join this device. So we can have ICMP message to inform regular device on the Internet, but the the device cannot be joined. and we introduce also So the device can also receive some IP ICMP message from Vintonet to tell that there is a problem when sending information. this is a way, for example, to reduce the sending rate because the device will knows that his his message are lost. So for that, we introduce also new matching matching operator, a new CDA, to compress also the ICMP payload. So all these things have been tested. We have implemented it in Openchic. on the it works fine. So Next slide, please. So I will go in will explain this different scenario. So the first one is the case where you have a device that send packets. So it's the wave line on the top, so you have the chic packet. and this check packet activate the lifetime on the sheik core or the core sheik.

Yeah. Yeah. Did you think about sending a net? in the latter case, right, the second case. to send Error message with a new code tilling time out or something like that? will be more descriptive.

But very similar. Yes. It can be linked with what we will present after where we generate So that's -- Okay. -- that's the possibility. Yes. So pass Pascal also during entire meetings, ask, for example, in the letter case, for example, if we don't have an answer then, we can also send the ICMP message to the device to be sure if the device is is correct or not.

IPV6 message. Sorry. So it is decompressed by the core sheikh. and this packet cannot reach the destination for any reason. So in that case, an ICMP V Six message will be generated by intermediary router, all the last host. And here, you so the ICMP message arrived to the core sheet. And if you have a roof to handle it, then we can send this information to the device to tell that there is a problem, and it's it's not necessary to continue to send at this rate the information. What we introduced also is the fact that the ICMP message contains the ipv6 original message that trigger the error So we introduced 2 element, what is called a match rule and match reverse rule. So in that case, it's much reversal, which means that I take the payload, and I try to apply a rule that exist for this device. unreversed because here, it's not it's not downstream.

But, for example, what we say by if we don't find the device in So in the context or there's there's a number of contacts you have in a core sheet, so you cannot identify the device. So you send a device not found. So you send a type 0 and a code 3, also not found. And if you find the host, but you don't find an appropriate rule, and there is no no compression rule. So in that case, you say, pork, not dot even if it's not the pork, but it's a way to indicate. We can do something more precise, but we have to discuss if it's necessary or not. And what is not introduced, but we will introduce in the next version of the draft is that, for example, if you have fragmentation And you cannot fragment the package because you your value in the rule diodes.allow you to compress to fragment that size, then you can send a pack we can send a packet to big to the sender. next slide."

I was wondering if there are cases why you would like the SEM image to start from the device. such a way that you ask your proxy to do something, for instance, if the device wants to send a 2k ping to see if there is 2k connectivity on the other side side and doesn't want to send a message with 2 k in it. just to because of the on the first hop, it's very costly. So it will tell the proxy a, I want to send an SCMP to this guy, but please build whatever of 2k size is below it. So you can actually check the rest of the way. That's because maybe later the device will send real 2k messages but he's not sure at this point that they will pass. So he just wants to assert So I'm not sure it that's a Good idea, and it's not present in the architecture. but for security point of view to generate 20 of message with one message is not something that Well, not plenty.

Then a number of a a data were also generated in cast pretty extensively also at an interim meeting. So this is the context. Next slide, please. Yeah. In order to address that, we propose document presented first time at the last meeting in Yokohama. It's formally proposed update. 288824. on the number of points, clarifications around some some corp options already covered in 8820 4, and there was especially one parameter of this. I think it was the only one when for for which there was no immediate agreement that than we we able we were able to achieve anyway. during an inter meeting, we are also introducing the description of our shake is supposed to be used for more recent corp options. clarifications on the Compression of the caught pivot marker and and mostly about how to use this one proxies are deployed. with or without the use of a score.

There was Salambique Yuitian, after discussing against now MT and so on, we ended up concluding for not set. and this version 1 is already considering this fixed consistently. Then Anan noted that for a number of the new options we are covering at least in some circumstances, we can be more aggressive in the proposed compressional strategy. For example, for the op limit option that we are introducing here the the original behavior with in mind for the rule description was just value sent, and that values anyway. going to changes. It traverses a chain a chain of hops. But, of course, that option is supposed to have 16 at default value. So if that's the value that that option happens to to have for that message, you can just take advantage of that and have a not sent for that option altogether. Next slide, please. Thanks. Yeah. Similar thing applies to other option. for the adoption, we originally talked of just just value send, and give you context, the echo option can be generated by a Cop server included in a co op response as a challenge for the client that is supposed follow-up with a new request including the same option with the with the same value for a number of reasons.

And, finally, on the same line, can be done for the request tag option it's essentially a value that client, this case can generate and include as an option in a request. in case multiple concurrent blockwise transfers are happening to prevent strange attack that can enforce mismatch and mix up of different blocks in different transactions. And here again, we went for value sentences general, but Actually, if if the client relies on the small set of well known values for this option one can definitely think about taking the advantage of a marketing cent instead. basically compressing each of those well known values into few bits. Next slide, please. But the biggest update of this version was really about they use checking the presence of proxies. The mechanics of this in itself and, again, it's just about clarifications was not really extended and to give you a reminder, bottom line, you don't use all score, it's all about having clear that the she crews apply hop by hop, thinking of co op ops, of course.

Is it possible that your outer rule says that there is an inner she grew, which is this, and you actually compress out that inner secret for the transmission saving those bytes as well. And then when you process that outer rule on the other side, then say, oh, I now have to make sure I expand that packet, put the sheet rule inside so that it will work. so that you can thus makes more complicated rules. But I'm wondering if, you know, because I'm always as we all are here, we're always thinking about counting bytes. on our on our wireless links.

So the next thing is the functionality in the architecture that is actively handling the way the rules are erased or updated. which is, in our view, the role manager. Maybe we will move a context management.

One of them is how do you install the route the the rules? in the devices like the low power devices, how do you install them? How do you update them? So that's the the the provisioning, and the filter, the firmware update, or whatever. how do you install those rules in such a manner that can trust what's being installed.

So We need to understand very well. what are the nature of the world, to make, for example, if you change a value the impact is very low because you don't attack a number a large number of packets because you just send you one parameter. But if you use ignore, for example, then you have a larger you can attack more packets. So the cost of the attack will be different regarding the kind of rule we are using. Sure.

So the first thing is as we worked on shake and generalize it from, say, Laura six bucks on 2 for the Internet, realize that implicit behind the scene of the exchange that we were compressing, there was a concept of a session that session has endpoints as usual, but it also points on the active set of rules. are being used, and I'll I'll say more about what I mean by active set of rules. or rule set, And there is also an agreement that has to be taken between the two endpoints of who is the device and who is the application. and then there is how we set up that session. like, like, how do we agree on which set of rules we're gonna work, but not only How do we agree on which parameters? Say more about that. apply to these set of rules. and possibly what additions from a original set of rules are being made and controlled by the work that Laurent has just been presenting, presenting, But some point, once we we have both parties, which kind of seemed to have an agreement on what they are working on, maybe there is there is some synchronization work to make sure that effectively they are the same data or or they change the less data that they don't have till we are sure that they will operate on the exact same set of rules. Because if they don't, then we can get any results. Next slide, please. So so we kind of agree that there is this concept of a session that could be more than one session."

But, basically, there is the the the need of something possibly abstract. but that really looks like an ipv6 header header. A a new extension there, should I should I And this new extension either would have to signal a check sum like UDP would have to signal a session ID like a UDP port and it may transport. submit a data. because sometimes you have to say something about the compression that's going on. I'm not saying that will this will be in line membership packet. not the intention, not all of this. intention is that it's compressed to what is effectively used For instance, inova, it's compressed to 0 because we know implicitly which session, we don't use a check sum because we use the CRC, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. this can be compressed to 0. but it can also be extended with options to contain everything that the set and needs to know. about this particular packet or the con the context of that packet. So abstractly speaking, we are after defining a header. Like I said, I'm not saying it's gonna be in line in the packet, but we'll see that the process of compressing, there is a logical step where this abstracted are is useful. Next slide, please. So you think you're going down this this steps of your stack, But at some point, you're you're building this IPL6 plus apearlayerprotocol that can be either there. Right? and then the about the yahoo. different units. protocol data unit, then then at some point, you want to compress it.

And then the the next header there would say u l p and then you have u l p. once you do that when you do that, you start compressing But there is one logical step before compression when you kind of reinsert that header insert that header so you know how to do the comprise to whom it's going, so all the session information, etcetera goes there.

I will show you 3 possibilities ants, kind of what I would like to do is gather feedback from the group about, you know, we wanna go.

So so the first kind of logical step from the previous state where we are where we have inserted this indicator is to decide to it's basically to compress the ULPN. And this we have to do either way. We we that's what while we're here, we want to comprise that thing. And The result would be, now, logically, you've got your iPC header, which says next header shake, then you've got your shake header which still says next set are u l p, but but it goes on the wire like this, it really means that what's coming after is compressed by shake.

Part of the we are saving 2 bytes from in the green piece because now we have the the checks have in the red piece. So it's not like we paid the full price of the shekeither.

And the support would be the session. to bite session. And as we work that out, you realize that in the shift PDU 1, which is the compression of the sheke header The session is now no more useful because it is the source port a few DP, so it can be compressed.

Basically, I'm agreeing with you, Pascal, but I'm wondering if we need this amount of choices and options in the the dock you meant. -- architecture and see this because we'll be applicable to anybody. Yeah. So the new architecture, you say, We're we're guiding you to how to think about seek to apply to new rule. and maybe there's wording around this which is needed, It will be there.

And so To do that I mean, in when you're compressing, you have to compress an integral number of bytes. So I added a structure, which is a sort of padding, padding, But this is one of the question I'm I'm wondering if the right way to do. And oh, maybe we can go to the next slide And Another thing I I I I I I was doing is that we we are compressing as much as we can. So we are taking whenever we can, we're taking the parameters from lower layers, And we we still need to make sure that these lower layers at the very end. We we have that number.

So Here, you have the payload data. and you have some padding, and this is the encrypted part of it. Next slide. Okay. So Yeah. Regarding the the sheet context that we need to to have,"

Because when you are encrypting a packet, you you you do have an negotiation protocols where you at least agree on on the key you're going to use to encrypt that packet. And so because you have that negotiation product, We can almost agree on every parameters that we need to perform the compression and the decompression. And that's one way to I I would say to synchronize the the context between 2 peers. So Here is the the sheet context we're basically using, but, actually, most of these parameters are already agreed by iikev2, which is the negotiation product for IPSec. And I mean, the additional parameters that we need to be to to agree on, is very limited. It's on the next slide, but I think it's 4 or 5 parameters. one of the things that we we also introduce is that the way we are compressing ESP is just one way, and we would like to give the maybe the possibility for other people to implement another profile. So we're just defining one profile for now. Next slide, Next slide, And so to to agree that we we we have to do an an hike extension. So At the end, I'll provide ended up in almost reducing by every ESP packet if you're talking about a VPN, ipv6 and ipv6, by 32 bytes. which make it quite useful. So, yeah, I mean, I I let Laura say, what he wants to say. Please go ahead."

    "text": "Yes. So you mean that you use i to provide the rules to the other hand, Actually, mean, the rules are being defined in the profile. and we agree on using the profile with some parameters that could be used to generate all the rules. For example, if you say We are using the MSB to compress the SPI for example, You need to understand how many bytes you are compressing. And That number of bytes is being agreed with IQV 2. Thank you. the parameters really Daniel, you can Yep. I I can hear you. Go ahead. Okay. So with just one thing we this draft has been outstanding for a long time. we already had similar things to to compress ESP. that was mostly motivated by IoT use cases. and we basically manually define and how we want to do to compress each fields. So I mean, we're very happy that she has been published and that we can reuse I mean, a generic framework, and that's That's why this work has been revived. We are I mean, we we hope to make a huge progress by the end by the next IETF meeting. on that So what do you expect from this group? I mean, do you want some reviews on that? So I I understand that the intention is not to publish here. Right? So it's more like reviews. Do you want reviews copied ipsect me. I mean, Yeah. We I mean, At least me, I'm I I will try I I will I will make that synchronization between the 2 working groups. Most of the work, I would"

    "text": "say for now is how we can handle the Chic beast. and how we so that's most of the work I think is going to happen in shift at least for now. So so that we clearly define how we compress, decompress, we make sure we are aligned with with the chic product called the shake architecture. And then mean, Yeah. That's where I see the work for now. Okay. So most most of the work happens here for now, but then you come back to when when you're happy with the ship piece. Right? or you can paralyze some of it. Yeah. I will paralyze. I mean, there is no I will in any case, I would copy the 22 groups. Yeah. That's Okay. So thank you. And unless there is a question, I guess it's time for us to conclude this meeting. So thank you all for being with us for those 2 hours. And you realize that we have a good number of interesting architecture questions on our plane. plate, and so so, yes, a lot of good work in front of us. Danielle. Thank you. Thanks a lot. And thank you all. Thank you. metric is a drone. Bye bye. Yeah."
