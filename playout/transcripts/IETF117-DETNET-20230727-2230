So the agenda for this session is So -- as this is a joint session with raw, there are a couple of raw topics on here. and then a couple of definite topics as well, which have have over spilled into this, which is great. So As part of the as was advertised in previous raw meetings, The rule working group is merging back into debt that I'm hoping that is not unfamiliar to people in this room and people. taking part. So in a in a sort of indefinite terms, This is our 1+1 merge point where we go back into a into a single debt networking group bad jokes aside. So one of the open questions is the status of the documents that are still resident. within RAW. So of those documents, There is one critical one that is still very much open for debate has already been circulated on the debt net group, which is the overall architecture document. of the remaining documents in the rule working group. They are either proceeding through IS g review and onwards."

The technology's draft is nearing completion, but we'll move across into debt net. OEM support again was originally split out of a a debt net document to draw out the raw features. That's now really being finished off within the working group, and the framework document was a mechanism we were using within the rule working group to capture thoughts as we went along with the intention of being the final piece of work from RAW. we're gonna hand that to the debt net chairs really to to do with as they see fit, either roll it into some other document or keep it rolling or quietly obsolete it. So if you have a strong opinion about that, I I suggest taking it to the list. The industrial requirements document has sat expired for some time. We have the chairs of law have reached the authors on the document to say, do they still have cycles to work on it? We didn't hear anything. Did they were welcome they welcomed the idea of additional coauthors joining that to get it across the finish line. and we did have, at the last meeting, a couple of people volunteer. So I think Really, the issue is whether we should circle back, we should make an AR before the handoff."

So the second thing is we worked a lot on terminology already in version 9, and there's a lot more in version 10 to come. I had some reviews in particular with Danfiddick, and Dave, and So so for instance, we clarify that we are building protection bath. So so the term protection path already there, what is missing in 9 and that we have to clarify is a good reference for what a protection path ease the context of dotnet and raw. So if if we have anything hopefully, in the debt net documentations, otherwise, as well. to point on to say what the protection path is. Now that's the term we're using. So what we Still call in 9, the PSC is basically in charge of defining time after time and quite quickly what is the new set of Protection path that we are using for the future packets. And when I'm saying future packets, it's it's one of those commands by Dave that the weight was welded with next packet was not so clear. that the PSC, still calling it PSC 9, is is not in the forwarding plane. It's making decision for short time, like the the next the packets to come but it's not in the flow of the packet itself. It just writes something for the forwarder to and the forwarder will apply the same logic to the next packets until the PSC comes back and and decide otherwise.

So so if you have this lane image in mind, you can see your car changing lane. which does not really help going forward, but helps avoiding some issues. And when we define those protection path, they may effectively go longer lane for a while, and then skip to the next lane and go back to the previous lane, etcetera. So there's to to go around issues. if we lose the concept of of lane, we still have to to kind of express that some hops are going forward, and the unidirectional and some hops are going orthogonal to the direction, and could be used in both directions. And that's well, in general, by the graph, for one protection path, it's one direction or the other. And we use we we fork the term north south, but right indicated that We are overloading terminology, which means something very different. effectively we are. So we need to find New terminology for Cross Lane, and and fought. So happy to to get any recommendation on how to call those things. For protection path, we seem to have settled just to know if it's lowercase or lowercase and then that will be And what do you do? Right? I mean, did I do the same? Okay. Next slide. Okay.

What what what the PC or whatever that is, because it goes away as well. computates, for a row is like a set of possibilities which are expressed in whichever fashion as a graph, a as as a collection of path can be expressed different fashion, the architecture is very abstract. on that. Now the collection itself is not a path. Example being, there are some hops there that can be bidirectional where in the actual protection path that the PSC will build for that. It will use those links in one direction or the other, but there won't be loops. 5.5.5.5.5.5.5.5.5.5.5.5. so so We wanted to avoid the confusion between the library and the box. And so you will see in the last slide that now we have a term for this. but we effectively made it clear that there is like the like the like the like the like the like the like the like the collection or the aggregation or the collections of all the possible path On the one hand, which we use the contract, now there will be a new term for it. And on the other hand, the protection path that are built dynamically for the future pack Next slide. Oh, by the way, part of the game is you do a path, you're supposed to be able to track the the path is is a fear of the path. This packet has experienced this path. What we what we see with this truck is the collection of all the possibilities for the future path. Right? And it could even be that the packet is kind of a network coded, etcetera, So it won't really follow a path. Only a piece of it will a certain path and be aggregated with another piece.

On what is OEM, meaning it's circulating in the management layer. And what is coming from the machine itself, likelier to trigger. So we had to clarify the the basically, the interfaces. Right? The the PSC, it was still the PSC in version 13. the PSC is talking directly with the system across some APIs and interfaces, for things like and to trigger to get things like SSI. But on the other hand, it's talking to OEM. Actually, there is there is a an EM responder component up there in the stack. that the PSC talks to to understand what's going on on the OEM side. So we kind of We call it OEM supervisor, and we can kind of clarify better if we can that these are different interfaces and different entity Next slide. so this is still quite open. So at least what what they clarified is Yeah. I mean, I thought it was clear, but it was not since we got this from e commerce. the PSC is not Acting on each packet, thinking about what's gonna happen for that packet. tried something in the fib or what so that the next packet will benefit fraud. from it, Right?

It seems that I'm not 100% sure that's the model you guys have in mind. And it seems that there is the one hand, the management plane, and in in the other, the control play. For me, both management and route computation were part of the controller play. the controller is a box with with all this in it, quote and quote. So I I have to make sure we we have the same model in mind the comments I got from Greg at the discussion were, like, PSC, which will be renamed, is is Management plane because it talks to AM. and not control of plane, and they would say, yes, but it still gives me a path. so if you can be talking to AM -- I think it would be helpful for the group to know the terms that we're moving towards that are aligned with the group. because there's a lot of new terms here, and I think people are trying to figure out how it relates to work we've done in the past. where if we start saying, here's the term we're actually gonna end up using. It'd be helpful. So for this for PSC, we've talked about using PLR. point of local repair, which is a a component in the protection architecture that some of you may know may know quite well. and What's So Right. But but you're asking about comments from people about it, and they don't know what you're saying.

That's Taylor to the the wireless environment But I think I remember the discussions, and I think that one is settled. the discussion was more of a layer on you and and Janush, kind of started the discussion. we clarified that we are layer 3, So so we might leverage The over our hearing, but not by doing it ourselves because that's another layer. So what we do is we kind of talk layer to layer down asking, a, if she can do of our hearing, please do it for us. It's gonna be the lower layer, which will do its best effort to to provide the evaluating. But I think the the the discussion at the time was it we made it look in the text. I made it look in the text. that as if our hearing was a function that is part of what we are doing. No. We are just controlling it, asking the lower layer to do something. us, but we are certainly not evaluating anything at but there's no reason why we can't use overhearing. Over hearing exists in multiple to wires even. and if that is something that we want to define as part of that function, that protection function, it's legitimate. Right. It was more more a matter of presenting it clearly as not a function of this layer, but the surface from the lower layer. insist to make sure. But it it there are multiple technologies that allow us to over here. if we want a protection function that takes advantage of it, that's great. just cheers"

I don't know if you had a chance to to look at it. But in the in that side, discussion, we brought up a couple of other terms that exists So there's a recovery domain, sometimes called the protection domain, is the set the area over which protection occurs or recovery. By the way, recovery is just a generic term in the the documents that a lot that disambig you sorry, includes both protection where you pre establish a backup data path or something that can be used to restore service. and repair where you do it, after the fact that there's a failure. That's really the distinction and recovery is the superset. So we said that for a recovery domain or protection domain. Those are good things to bring in. to the document, to reference. We also talked about protection group, a recovery group, which is the set of paths that are used to to deliver the the protection service. the thing that was new is this track concept where it's not a it's not the set of paths which are basically ordered links and nodes, but it's just the whole collection of all the nodes and links without ordering. So it's a it's a it's a little bit of a different concept, and that's why there's a new term that is being proposed here either a recovery graph or protection graph. There was another term we talked about that I liked a little bit better, but I can this I think what I'm seeing, there's nothing to add on my side. You have several more slides. Do you want to touch on any of those? I think"

I think we should We need to set a date for a next horizon for when we want to say it's really done with last call. And for that, I guess, we would like to solicit input from those of you who are continuing have the side meetings and the conversations to see what's reasonable. can I make a request here as sort of outgoing raw chair this has had a lot of review within raw but we really need the wider audience within DetNet to review the terminology to make sure it fits within the model that you guys have built around dotnet. And this is the chance to make it align. because this should align with the rest of dotnet because from a technical perspective, it does. just if we can get the terminology right with there.

The the structure of the oh, Okay. The struck the structure of the slide is it's like this. The first I'll just give a brief background and the motivations that help us to come up with these contributions And then after that, I am going to just give a brief summary of what have had been done in Yokohama on these things. And then give some new contributions that'll be put into this a draft, and then we give the definition and the extension for the young model and then some future work. So this slide, they just, you know I don't know if there's some Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So this is basically just the the title is like a logical dead net transit node. So this is like a a 3gb SA2 project. So make a 5 g s as a dead net node. So it's look look at that central box. It's just like a 5 g s a system. And then, tomorrow, left the side in the UAE, to our right side is the UKF. And then you have, like, the left side, you have the DSPP. is the device side. part.

It can it can be, like, a u e itself, be the receiver of the Datagram or the UAE can also be a are like, you know, can standing towards the left hand side is that side is also a dead net system. So it can be, like, the receiver or it can be a router. Next one? So this is just to give you a concept. And here is like, okay. If we zoom into the 5 g s logical dynamic node, it has a component architecture. So it's not just a single diagonal. And then there are there are can be muckable UTFs, the user plan functions is like a Roger. So it can be more than 1 within a 5gs And then the the project from the SA to 3gbSA 2 Say, okay. If you have more than one UPS, and then you may have more than one dynamic node. And then each one will be identified by the corresponding UPF node ID. Here, for this particular example, is kind of crowded. But here, we have only 2 u p we have 2 UPS. So that means we have 2 5gs Datadogno. So okay. just that you look at the box and look at, okay, this is the component architecture. This is the background that motivate motivate app to do something. that will be in the next slide. The next slide has been presented in Yokohama cost in the 5 g s, it ask For 2 way communication, one thing is for the 5 g s, As the dead logical deadline node report, the information. like resources, capabilities, and adjacency toward a dynamic controller."

So it's like a 2 way communication. So the thing one requirement here is, like, from the 5g ads. They're they're There were 2 Leer than 1 was seen from 5 g from 3gpp to IETF in last November to ask for something like, basically, 5 g s want to get a logical node provisioning. like mac and latency within the node component node. Merck the log within the component node. And then the layers in back from IKEF to 3 GBP, the acknowledged this as a problem, but there at that moment, there was no or work that has been identified to tackle on this. But the faltering delay later, we found the there's the 1 one draft. It's called the BandNET IETF than that probably young. And from that, actually, it's going to help. So in Yokohama in Yokohama, we asked, and then later, it got successfully reactivated. Yes. This is a ping dong in Yokohama, but the a longer can you go to the next one? Yeah. Along the line, and then when we try to continue refine the work, And then we said, okay. After there are more requirements in the 5 g f as a logical dynamic node. So, basically, this time, we country build by enhancing. than that young configuration. One thing is a dynamic no type. it's cost like this is like a component, no type, And then we want to generalize. Okay. We want to define something to make it more generalized. So this time, it can be, like, a 3gb defined 5 g s, and later maybe have something else. That's the first bullet."

And then the component node ID Remember, I showed a 5 g s can be a component. and it depend Depending on the number of UTF, it can have more than 1 Denac node within it. So here, we we we try to define a high level component node ID such that it can accommodate mall substructure ID. It's like a hierarchical ID definition. a new parameter. And then the other one is uplink and the downlink. Actually, about here, I do not I would do not want to expand But for 5 g app, it has the concept of uplink and the downlink. Well, with remember the DSTT on the left side port, and with a from a tunnel called video session, And then toward the right side, the n w port. So that one is like the can go up link. can can opening a direction or can go downlink a direction? So that is all those things we want to identify or differentiate. So 3 bullets, we came to the network, we defined in this ID Here, we are actually about to use r c8340. So here, we reference data syncs and the find the this young model definition. Okay. Well, we're going to continue refine it. It's just like a preliminary definition at this time. k. And the last the last next one will be the last one. Here, just say, okay. This is the work. The next step will be, you know, there are more in this area caused the the 5 g s of the logical Dan NAND node is also evolving project. So yeah. So this is the the things. Yeah. That's why I usually I try to gather a a slot here because This is regarding 5 g mobile wireless and the dead net plus, yeah, that's why I got this idea. Thank you.

Yes. in real life, you will have a single UPF connected to multiple rands, and each rand will have different characteristics depending on the local sites. So You cannot treat the whole 5gssu depicted here, as a single definite node. you would have you can have a single UPF with 2. or more, Rands, that will have different characteristics. Yeah.

This is. As the quarter, I want to give some additional information about the young model extension. because because TMZ has to bring some information or requirement from the 3rd GDP side. So we think there will be some new attributes should be extended in an existing ITVR model And now what we are doing is just to try to reuse the the existing young model that has already been defined, for example, in ITFtopology Young. And another another option is that Another thing is that if we cannot find the proper attribute that has already been defined, we will try to define something new. For example, the the 5G is composite node type and 5G system direction. The case is that we are hesitating whether we're just extending the existing IETF topology young, or we we are supposed to you now have, for example, the container of the net. yaw model and then do the work in the dynamic yaw model.

This is Joanne Chun from ZTE, and this is about to their traffic engineering extensions for enhancement of that So first, as discussed in the scaling requirements against the there are different levels of applications. We are coexist and we will be transported into gaming network and the the services demand different levels of SOEs guarantees. As the figure shows, we summarize that some on. SLA parameters for different applications. for example, their cloud based applications and remote control will demand their their district the delay of jitter and high the ribosome and your 4th smart grid, it will demand the ultra low latency and ultra low cheaper, and therefore in destroying so that it it will demand low latency and low jitter and high reliability and type and wipes, and therefore, consumer entertainment. it will give out high bandwidth and and low latency.
