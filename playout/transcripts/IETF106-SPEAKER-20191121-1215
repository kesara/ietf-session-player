    "text": "to consider that mmm maybe a follow-up question so when you create a transport slice what are the parameters that let\u0027s say Phi G system will daily give it to the transport so let\u0027s say you are a let\u0027s see what will be the parameters I\u0027m just curious at the high level again this is something I don\u0027t want it is something that we didn\u0027t haven\u0027t decided in the design team but as a general concept the input that you receive here I want to connect H 1 2 3 2 H 4 \u0026 5 so a group of edge that should be connected the SLA an SLO for that connectivity is what is the objective that you want to raise is the latency reliability security and so on so forth and some other data which is the use case dependent in the 5g for example I mentioned some other information that helps us not only for automation but for the other assurance and other aspect is how this relates to the end-to-end network a slice which customer is a single what service is that so these are very high-level the detail of that obviously we have to go through it to make sure that we are addressing it in a very logical way and whether or not we need to add other attributed A\u0027s or you know remove it this is the we have to go through the process okay thank you okay no problem okay this is a important from SK key you so a very nice talk I have a one question one comment so you basically you propose intended based and that talking will be useful for our net optimizing is it correct yes so basically you can see a high-level some policy service level will be translated into metal label or device Allegra right so I believe it one of our core functions is translation so are you considering how to translate sub survival policy into low-level policy are you considering or are you working for that what is your question how do you translate policy from between different devices or so which means it you know the high level service of level yes agreement why kind of subjective level of policy I can def of you if you look what Raisa was was talking about actually is an abstracted view right but you typically see today unfortunately I redid a lot of work in ITF with respect to data model standardization but you do see is that the vendors have not all implemented that uniformly yet right so what you need to do is basically even if we say about intent based networking what you stiff typically still see is that you need a device model which is specific for a specific vendor so as such what we are doing is we like these abstract service models which are being defined like for example even in IDF EF l2 as an all 3sm being defined alright as a service model but what you "

    "text": "see is if you have to implement that to the specific device you sometimes need a translation layer so we have like device abstraction capabilities which are actually mediating towards a specific device implementing that particular use case in order to translate for the specific models which that device actually has implemented and but so we have this that is a abstract service layer and then there is a device type of model which is actually then implemented into the device depending on the capabilities that device has enabled then maybe women just add I mean that actually only needs to exist on the edge itself as we mentioned there so it\u0027s beyond that everything in between is about how you can assure the the well the abstract SLA that gets translated into something meaningful for the network how you can ensure that in a closely collimation opener yeah basically the IDF developer many young the era models high-level and low-level the problem is the link to each other the translation is missing line now so many people constantly working with it basically the I to and i7 data security a function working alone about a member so we are basically implemented the policy translator to link high-level policy into low level so I believe Network slicing case I think we can elaborate the previous our work I mean if there are missing pieces which you believe need Standardization I think we are happy to come talk and then see how we can the other our question is a some a collaboration with the other standard apart for example the I to honest F we are facing the problem is we are using in security NATO spirit function with the Sdn for example the problem is ITF I to an ACEF and Sdn the interface should be specified the problem is how to collaborate with other area standard body so your cases the 3gpp and airier some standardization and I\u0027d have some the station has something called collaborated right so there is my some actually how to collaborate we are we\u0027re probably running out of time here but we can take this offline to see what needs to happen okay thank you thank you very much we have to stop okay sorry [Applause] "
