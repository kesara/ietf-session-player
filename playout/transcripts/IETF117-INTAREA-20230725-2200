I don't know, but I can imagine there may be a situation that because of the time domain and maybe need for something special. Another case is IoT. I'm much more confident about that. I'm a little bit familiar with 7 Splinker networks, like, for agriculture and as a case that could really use some really simple IP lights, like address maybe to octets, The header may be atocteds, GDPR only, that sort of thing. IPRI Food provides, again, instantaneous compatibility. Another case would be highly Secure networks, maybe financial, maybe military, that could use something special. And, actually, I believe alone is already should be happy about that because of not disclosing the internal IP addresses. the references which are light, you can discard them.

So you can change it later if you want. But you can you you don't have to replace everything to connect it. And another interesting thing, I think it's gonna happen to IPV 6 is that IPRS is gonna make it focus on the Internet a little bit. and more specifically on connecting networks Okay? Not not host. Like, it's into that. Right? which might not necessarily be IPV6. And, also, IPref is gonna allow ipv6 not to have to be everything to everyone, which I think is gonna be 4. I'm Also, also, really exciting out on the nontechnical aspects of this. see. I think HyperF is gonna support some substantial economic activity around networking. It's not just you know, the transitions, the gateways, the architects, services shows of that stuff. That's the thing. There's gonna be innovation around that because IPI have bring some new possibilities here. Next. Impact on MPV 4 needs some context. So the context to that is the so called shortage of IP addresses. This is a term that is no longer accurate. It was accurate when some 25 years ago, but these days is a bit of a miss number. It's because there is no shortage of IPV for addresses. something else is a problem. So how does IPG for"

So there is a high level 32 bit space, and there is a net there is another theoretically, it's a little bit space, but in practice, it's like 24 bps or so. at least. this obviously creates a problem because those new IP addresses They may exist, but they're hard to reach. So that's is a problem known as nuts reversal and something that I would like to rename to address space traversal because this is a little bit wider. issue them that. So that problem was solved part by assigning global IP addresses. This works only one way, but that's okay because most of the services are client server types, so let's say it works, so that's fine. Now IPref brings complete solution. IPref works like peer to peer and across all of addresspaces including IPV 6. And remember, Those others are also published. So that's effectively solve that problem. completes So the impact on IPV 4, the first thing that we have to say is that Indeed, ipref makes ipv4internetpossible. There's just no no way around it. We need to know that. And so all of this extra IP address is like with these 2 hierarchy here, you get, like, 32+24, so like 56 beats, If you're doing something like CG nuts, then you're getting another level. So it's like levers with another 22 bits. So it's like 78 bits of IP addresses. And they all are reachable. They all can publish services. They all are in DNS.

I guess There's some really smart people there, and they they figure out how to make it more useful. Okay. IPRF incidentally, this is interesting. ipRF does make this IPV 4, you know, potential possible, but it's also gease IPV 6, means of winning out And this is because the way IP ref works, the the the host that communicates with the other end Actually, doesn't know that other end rounds. Doesn't know those IP addresses are, that doesn't know what that other space is and doesn't know what the practical it is. So so IPV filter host maybe talking an ipv6 course and doesn't even know about it. even more, even more, even if you does know it is actually ipv4, but there is an Internet between those. So and that Internet may or may not be IPV4. It could be ipv6, and it really doesn't matter. And communicating hosts don't know about that. So at this point, at this point, it's like, what do you care? Right? You might as well be ipv6. So this is the reason why they think what they think eventually no matter what, ipv6 will prevail. I'm particularly seeing this because it's you know, special network. It requires some specialization with IPV6 afford to do whereas APB 4 can't.

So This works because when you really think about that, and work on this, then you notice that the host that originates communication actually does not need to know what the destination IP address is. So we can so instead of trying to figure out what it is in to the ipv0. the 4 hosts what the ipv6 address is just don't do it. We We just allocate reference that represents those. And the reference is just an opaque number. Okay? And then when the packet eventually reaches the target network the target network has the enough information and context to direct it to the correct host based on the reference. So that's how this works. And Because it doesn't use any negotiation. There's no negotiation necessary for this. There is no bravo configuration necessary There's no shared information than that is required This produces an incredibly remarkable solution. So this so this is real. You can actually connect before to v 6 and not even know about it. You can go behind that. You guys like, carrier grade not, which is like a tree level of nuts. Okay? still works over that.

So this is combining those 2. So let's talk about what we're trying to do here. Alright. So there are 3 different use cases that I think fall into this intersection between proxy configuration and PVDs. that have come up a lot For us, recently, we're doing some new stuff with proxies around mask, so some more secure HTTP proxies. but it applies in general. So first, we have the whole category of network provided proxies and how can we discover the network has a proxy associated with it. Then there's a question of I already know about a proxy. I wanna find a related one, And finally, I want to understand something about how this proxy applies to traffic and what it is able to support. So to illustrate each of those cases quickly, First, we have a network provided proxy discovery case. So a client is connecting to host through a network and the network. has associated with it or it's directly providing 1 or more proxy servers, maybe that's a mask proxy or maybe it's a SOCs proxy or something else. a couple different use cases where this is interesting. There are I'm sure people are some people are familiar with cases where networks already provide proxies oftentimes, to be able to, like, filter content on them for enterprise scenarios. But we also have cases coming up"

    "text": "such as the 3gpp proposal around something we call ATSSS, where you have a proxy in a network that can support multipath access so you could migrate connections, across Wi Fi and cellular links, If you have both of them provided by the same ISP slash carrier, And that is a case where it's kind of an open question about how would you actually discover the presence proxy. this is one use case. The other use case second one is when we have a proxy I already know about. So let's say I was configured in my system settings or some enterprise profile, oh, use this HTTP proxy. And that's all well and good, but maybe I want to discover other properties about it because there are new protocols that can support proxying UDP over HTTP or proxying IP over and I want to know does it support that. and if I If it does support that I need to know the URLs or other properties about how to get to this thing, how can we discover what's related to the proxy I already am on? So And lastly, some proxies may not apply to all traffic. This is, you know, very similar to what we would think of as, like, a split DNS case for a VPN. but here just in the proxy world and VPN protocols like IP2, allow you to communicate, their split DNS configuration, but there isn't a great way to do that with proxies yet. Okay. So if you're familiar with the current proxy ecosystem, you may be thinking of, well, there's pack files and there's WPAD, and that solves proxy discovery, and that lets you learn about, you know, which host name should go for the proxy and not. But for various reasons, I'd like to not reuse that solution. going forward for new things. So these, 1st of all, aren't actual IETF standards. I think that they came about"

So I'd like to avoid building more of that in, just to learn a split DNS list of domains. these also don't work with new proxying types. we're seeing a family of new proxying types coming from mask and the HTTP working groups that are based on a full URLs and PAC files as they are defined always have a host name in a port, and and They just kind of don't they would need to get overhauled anyway. So I'd like to avoid doing this, and I think we can do a lot better. we can do a lot better with PVDs or provisioning domains. which is something that came out of Interia. So Raise your hand if you remember what a PVD is. Alright. That's pretty good. woo. Okay. Okay. So PVDs are here to help. It's So they were defined originally in the multiple interfaces working group that was closed, and then we finished some of the work here in Interia, So 7556 defines PVDs, as the architecture and the concepts, PVD is a consistent set of network configuration information. And then 8801, which was done in interior, essentially 2 main things. It has V 6 RA option that allows you to explicitly name, a provisioning domain, handle multiple RAs, from the same router to say you have many different uplinks and also to associate additional information with particular PVD, and that's this JSON dictionary 8 8 8 8 that can be fetched over a secure HTTP connection to say, Here's other properties that I don't want to stuff into my RA. it's the, you know,"

What are some examples of when we have them? And the the common ones are we have, you know, my Wi Fi uplink have a router. Maybe I have 1 or more PVDs from it. My carrier network is giving me at least one PVD. But if I have a different slices or APNs, those are each technically a different PVD. It may have different local addresses and different DNS configurations, etcetera. every VPN tunnel, it's its own PVD, But, you know, here here is something that I don't think we ever really explicitly dated before in PVDs, but A proxy itself is a PVD. It is a way to access a particular network, it is a type of tunnel. It know, you don't generally do DNS over the proxy, but it does DNS for you. And, like, is its own way of accessing resources And so a network, may have a proxy as part of its configuration, but then that proxy itself is yet another tunnel or sub configuration itself. It is a provisioning domain. And so that is the kind of philosophical leap that this proposal is based upon. the document is really doing 2 technical things, and this is just a 0 0 document, and I think there's a lot more work that would need to be done to flesh it out and at all the considerations we would want, But, fundamentally, it allows you to given a PVD that you know about, you can enumerate proxy URLs that are associated with that PVD. saying that, hey. My provisioning domain has proxies or other proxies, associated with it. You may be interested in them. And secondly, you can fetch pvd configuration, 4,"

So first, here's an example additional information JSON dictionary that we already have a PVD, it already has an identifier and expiration and prefixes. And then there's just one new key which is an array of proxies. So you can enumerate those. And in this case, I have 1 http proxy and 1 http proxy that supports UDP. and that's this URI template thing. But that could be a SOX URL or any other type of thing. So you say, I have these proxies. There's an open question here about do we leave it implicit? What the types that the protocols here are, or should we have an explicit nested structure that can be a nice little bike show discussion we could have. But, fundamentally, it's like, you know, let's have a list of proxies associated with a PVD. It seems like a reasonable addition to have And then the other mechanism is if I know about a proxy already, how do I fetch the PVD that belongs to it if I want to learn about other proxies or I want to learn about details, that may only be configured in that dictionary like what are the DNS domains? As the document is written now, you do a get to the URL of the proxy and you use the content types that are defined already for PVDs. We talked about this yesterday at the mask working group meeting. I think there's suggestion to instead just use the name of the proxy and fetch it off of the well known slash PPD, which is already defined, That sounds great. I can change that. But but, fundamentally, it's like, if you know about a proxy, here's a way to get to a dictionary of things about it. which may include other proxies or may include other information."

If you go outside of these, I may not be respond. So it's kind of a hint saying, if I have many different proxies, that this is a way for that proxy to tell me oh, yeah. The I'm only used for remote access to my enterprise, and I'm only gonna be able to resolve these. as an aside for the use case here, recently on Apple Platforms we have support for using mask essentially as a VPN replacement and Cisco has built support for that. And this is one of the things that they were wanting to have that rather than forcing clients to have a static configuration of the domains that belong to a particular proxy, proxy could update this list and kind of cut that list down as configuration is dynamically changing. I think this is something that would be useful. It's something that VPN protocols already have. Lorenzo, did you wanna jump in Now okay. I'll get to the end. Almost done. anyway, So there's a question, I think, of venue for where this is appropriate When we discuss this in mask, I think, you know, this is an area that people working on these types of proxies believe is useful to solve, I yeah. It is explicitly not within the charter of mask. I don't think it necessarily fits within HTTP. since this could apply, you know, much more broadly beyond HP proxies conclude socks, etcetera.

So Why does this document exist is the first question I get asked. So SOV6 as it stands, has known, security vulnerabilities. particularly when you manage to get a packet into The so called limited domain. And those security vulnerabilities are documented, both in the security considerations draft, And in a mail fridge on the v Six ops list, etcetera. and the links are in the deck. But 8402 says that SLV 6 that leaks beyond the boundaries of a domain, creates a security violation, 8754 says that to mitigate attacks, full thing into the domain is required. The only current way 2 actually limit the domain. is through LPM filtering. Now There are some operators, out there some way that may argue that they can do that on every external port in the domain. I would for myself and for many other people I've spoken to argue that LPM full filtering on every external port on a broad scale is neither practical nor is it scalable And I just wanna point out that if you look at operators History with prefix filters, over the last 20 years by taking a look at the BGP tables,"

So If you're interested in hearing about exactly what the security considerations are, take a look. Otherwise, you know, myself and my coauthors are quite happy to have this conversation with anyone at any time. So what does the draft attempt to accomplish. We want to give operators, that feel that it is necessary to protect themselves by closing the domain a way to do this. So instead of saying that your domain is closed because of some LPM filters, which are pretty error prone. We wanna make it fail closed, if the operator chooses to take that option. So we are giving them an option. It's not mandate 3. we are hoping that people will actually take this option but we are trying to create an option. We wanted to keep this really simple. We know that SLV Six is out there. It's deployed. rewriting SRV 6 now wouldn't work. There's been a lot of work into it. They will some people who love it, we need to keep SLV 6 intact while at the same time fixing security floor.

A 100%, the differences here, we are saying that this is an option to allow operators to choose to run it as ipv6, with the security concerns, or run it as its own protocol? Well, I so it's it's great that you're saying it's an option, but I'm just wondering all the ramifications introducing a new ether type on the network I I I doubt that's the easiest thing in the world. Right? Because they have all the routers, all the devices, all of a sudden, using a new ether type is that Is that feasible, And the other the other point is this is actually kind of mudging layers.

So we're We're using this ether type as a pseudo new protocol even though it's it's still For all other purposes, ipv6, The other question I have is how is this any different than if we just look at the Yeah. PV 6 packet. We see there's a routing header in there why not just filter that at the edge of the networks instead of doing LPM or anything fancy. Okay. So let me address that last question first.

I would say that when you go out there, to enable MPLS a network, atstage. right at the start, You have to go out there and enable Every interface, full MPLS. If you are deploying SLV 6 in greenfield's environment where you've never deployed it before, It is no more difficult to do that than it is to turn on MPLS. It's the same. Turn on the knob. etcetera. Yes. You may not be able to do this cross devices that don't support it. Same thing with MPLS. But that is an operator choice. The operator gets to choose, do I, say that if it needs to run this, and I can run this in fail closed. Or do I accept that I'm gonna run the other way have to LPM filter anything and hope I get it right. Alright. But it's not just about turning a new Ether type. It's also about the management patrolling, all of that has to change. Right? So So I think on one hand, you're saying, don't change. SRV 6, and that's a very noble goal.

Oh, okay. So let let me follow-up. One one more sub question. So If there's no edge, and you're using a new ether type what prevents forwarding, the packets in that ether type outside of the network. Because if they're going outside of the network, Typically, I'm only going to enable the processing of that ether type. on the ports that I know that it is needed, it is default when I've got this enabled, to that if the type processing not being enabled, the same way that by default, MPLF Processing doesn't leak, because you've got to explicitly enable it. Well, but but this ether type is containing ipv6. So an edge device CSS and forwards the IPV 6. And the edge device is gonna say, well, won't know that this is V Six because it's got the ether type on it. Okay. I guess I just don't see how having a new ether type or the same packet format. potentially helps. Okay. Thanks. We have to move on There's a big q now. Tianjin? Yes. Kenji, China Mobile.

Since those are real the ether tab, the real layer like a big one. But now you're trying to use something You know, it's like a bigger patch for some very smaller things. Then you try to define a new Etherhub, that's on the same equipment class. like the 0x800zerax81.1q, and the regular the traditional V Six.

We can define new user time. for IPO or IP tunnel, for GRE tunnel, all kind of tunnel. So that is the type wise I want to argue.

So that's the the context of the discussion. That's the the context of the problem. Next slide, please. if you look at RFC 4676, there's a DHCP options where an endpoint can obtain the location information from the network. It defines 3 different variants. 1 is about network providing the client client's location. another is about It's a networks location. It's a point of attachment. and thirties and node closest to the to the endpoint. So it defines a different semantics. So that's 4676. Hey. An end station using DHCP will be able to obtain this information. Other variant is RFC 60 to 25. it's about geospatial coordinates. The endpoint can again using DNC, we will be able to obtain the the geospatial coordinates. the similar semantics are missing in IPV 6 in Endy. If I'm obtaining, let's say, data's configuration or or c 6106. I want to be able to. obtain and, let's say, obtain the other parameters let's say, through PVD options or other things. Now"

IPV 6ND to define new options. So the 3 ways, I think, the the the the different approaches to get Next slide, please. So one is define a new, you know, PVD option essentially along like, in how we what we did with 6106 Right? One is for Civic another is for geospatial. I think now, again, As in DHCP, we can define similar variance because In many indoor Wi Fi environments, with indoor localization, the network, like an access point, knows the precise location, the endpoint. So if you can provide that to the endpoint in the SIP signaling, it can be used let's say in the SIP PNE header, p hyphen ANI, accessing for identifier hidden, it can include the the information. So there is value in the call signaling it will be of immense use. I think so one approach is to know, straightaway as a define a new n NDA option for the same. replicate no. Replicate the same semantics as literally what is in know, the DHCP, the the the the DHCP and the the corresponding DHCP options, which pretty much use the same semantics and define a new ND option. That's one thing. 2nd approach, next slide, please. Is Ulotron proposed a new draft on universalr, it's purpose is to use this around. The RMS is opaque. carriers for configuration. But the draft, you know, the working group did not like that. It didn't go anywhere. But now the question is, Should we bring that back? And 3rd option is next like this. there is the PVD support now that more it's an"

Now the the question is also, like, is location a PUD know, specific domain, or is it a global. I think that's but But at least semantically, you know, we should be able to deliver location as a PD option. Right? Or define some JSON elements, allow the end point to use the URI to query the URL to get down. the current the location information. So different ways to, you know, get there. Now last slide. Please make sure. So now I think the I got sound feedback in 6, man. I think generally I think there was one discussion on the it's a network location, there's no problem. If it's a client specific location, If DCP is the right way because there's a client specific identifier. But the counterargument is When you do unicast, you have the same semantics We do that unicast extensively for various use cases. So different ways to get there, this agreement on this if you see value, at least There's a use case. The emergency calling is a real use case. We want to be able to support So Any feedback is appreciated. then Hi. Bench Schwartz. Meta. So I went and and glanced at the RFC, and this option is defined for GSE 4 and the hcpv6. So I'm a little confused about why you think it's why that's not sufficient. I think the it's I I think with DNS, we have defined if you look at 61 Right? We have defined the DNS configuration options. We the using the RA, I'm able to deliver The network can deliver the configuration. Along with that, if the if we can deliver additional parameters. This is the location you're in. the endpoint is has all the configuration."

    "text": "I I I would roughly describe the goal of the this part of IPV6 architecture is making it possible. to run an endpoint without DHCP. and it is possible certainly, very possible to run an ipv6 endpoint without any use of DHCP. that doesn't mean that everything that can be done using DHCP must also be able to be done without DHCP. and this seems like you you've actually mentioned some pretty good arguments for why DHCP is an especially good fit for this metadata. because neighbor discovery is really about learning properties of my neighbors that And RA is learning about properties of the router and provisioning domains are learning about properties of the domain, and that's none of none of those are exactly what you want. What you want is properties of this particular host, this endpoint, and that's the dynamic host configuration I I think that's a good comment, but I think we have already standardized you know, 66 the 6106. We already standardized 8801. we are already on that path. We are delivering configuration options to the endpoint. So I'm not taking you know, entering to the debate of whether the HCP is good or not, but if if I'm able to operate a network with ipv6 only without using data I should be able use the same for this as well. Yes. Laurence. So a few points. First of all, I think The thing that you need to think of before you do any of this is what is your update strategy? because different configuration mechanism, different update strategies, DHCP's up state strategy is you can't ever update anything. ARays are pushed based using multicast and and those updates apply to everyone in the network. so on and so forth. That is something you need to decide before you do anything. So and and location is obviously a thing that's not for client. it's actually per client, per point in time."

The other thing is Please, please, please, please, and life you know, we will hit you over the head in 6 months if you try to do this. please don't do anything that requires unicastyrase. RA is a push based configuration mechanism. It's it's it's basically everything in the RA has lifetimes, it is fundamentally sort of push config. So don't do anything that requires unicast rs. A bunch of platform which won't do it. You won't have any update strategy. won't end well. other thing I would say is for RA versus PVD, generally speaking, I think, when we were working on the PVD stuff. sort of the design team and the folks that were involved in that discussion were usually thinking along the lines of the RA is for bootstrapping and for stuff that you need to connect to the network. And stuff that ideally is needs to come in, in one packet. And so there's a lot of things where the array just's fate shares everything because the single packet has the DNS configuration, the prefix explorer, the PIO, the RIO, the the RIA time, everything in one packet. This is probably not something that needs to be there. So generally speaking, I think the PVD is is actually the best option here. And there is an update strategy for PVDs because I I can't remember what it is, but there is a way to to There's an expiring time, but there's also a refresh mechanism. Yeah. because we we did that at the well, no. I wasn't in among the office, but that it does have an update So Okay. Thank you, Lorenzo. You know, Enrique, again, the ROC 8801, the the quota with Toby. those PVDs, right, can be generated dynamically. so it can be per host. maybe both page visitor. like, Yeah.

And, also, she want to deliver client specific prefix. Will you do unicast status? unicast? RA is not like a like, some bad thing. We we are we are doing in wireless it's it's it's in life. Right? I think but but yeah. So but but I think I under I agree what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. key myself. Some of what I've said has already been said by others, but I'd just like to say, I I I might have some more to add. So I don't think this necessarily belongs in RA's.RA's are for I've just connected to this network. How the hell do I route packets on it? This isn't to how the hell do I route packets. This is it's important information, but it's something else. RA's are also multicast, so you give the same answer to everyone. might want to save someone on this Wi Fi access point at a different to someone on that WiFi's point. You can't. You could kind of do that with RAs, but it would be mass Let's not do that. And, also, this is just adding more and more information into RA's, something which is constant slightly shouted out over the network. And we don't want to be making these massive packets, which we're shouting out is to everyone. this probably DHCPV6 might be an option. PVD seems like a more sensible option here. But yeah, do one of those Don't do our eyes. Right? Thanks. Thanks for staying back here. Hey, Sri. Just some a quick suggestion about in the first slide, they show they are a picture about the 5 g here. And then, actually, the 5 g has already defined some very good technology for the positioning park. It's very accurate. So if you put there, and there's you're trying to do something overlay and have the IP to do the predicting part. Actually, it's it's way, you know, worse than what 5 g the radio can do"

Benchmark's meta. that's that's So first of all, on on on whether on DHCP's update mechanism to Lorenzo, my understanding is that if the client really wants fresh, DACP metadata can rerun the DHCP Discover broadcast and get fresh metadata back. And so I think that if you're in this situation, I can imagine you're You you make an emergency call. The phone doesn't have good geolocation. It that DHCP discover like, right now and gets an absolutely fresh estimate. So So so I think DHCP does actually suffice for that. If you do wanna do this using provisioning domains, I would strongly encourage you to make the content of the provisioning domain JSON document itself static, move this location question into a separate service. because I don't want the provisioning domain to have to be dynamically generated. ideally, I'd like to be able to, like, by hand in an editor, write out my provisioning domain JSON document, and drop it on the file system. This dynamic thing is separate. Got it. Thanks for the feedback. Thank you. Alright. Okay. Thank you.
