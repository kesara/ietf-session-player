    "text": "internal node reachability terms of all kind of funky failures right we added a new section and basically what we recommend is that the internal node injects its loopback address into the north direction which basically without failures allows you to reach is no internal either from south and from north ok the interesting things happened is when nodes lose northbound connectivity you you have to think that through what happens but basically the node may become unreachable from certain nodes so what we recommend is that in such scenarios the notes inject south PGP ties there loop X which makes them reachable again at least from the south so that marriage may be farther a consideration but we thought that through and there\u0027s a section dealing with those failures the precise D for regeneration procedures in the southbound direction has been written down so it\u0027s not entirely trivial I pretty much spelled out the rules I don\u0027t think on the fly it makes a lot of sense to go precisely through them what they mean but I put two nevertheless into the materials that people have something to refer to so a node will inject a d4 under certain conditions right because in other conditions the d4 injection we just need lead to black hauling which makes no sense The BFG interactions are are relatively easy so we allow or allow or optionally it is just fine to run BFD on the same links as rift right and we just specified the interaction that you bring BFD after the rift brought the three-way and the BFD after it came up and goes down can break the stuff down so to prevent all this admin down problems that are protocols have we aligned the link ids which is basically unique identification of a link in rift with BFD discriminators so implementations can very easily basically reuse the values if that makes any sense and the BFD may be used on subset of links on all the links in terms of like having a micro like all of a sudden right micro be of tea running over a lakh and ultimately basin on experience the encoding has been changed what it means in thrift terms is that a lot of sets have been replaced with maps and lamentation get much faster now look for elements with india encoding much faster when they when certain information elements have to be accessed and that\u0027s about it [Music] i\u0027m surely on the time greg Mirsky as t can we go back to the BFD slide yes sir I\u0027m thinking so we be the we refer to "

    "text": "you are on the fabric this only works on a 5 stage or larger because in a three stage fabric a three area fabric you cannot tell where you are because everything you\u0027re symmetrical so basically all you\u0027re doing is running SPF with a hot count of 1 you said all your metrics to one run SPF and then you do some simple math subtracting max from current and etc and you figure out where you are on the fabric and as I said this is not something that works on a three stage or a three fabric we have changed the encoding it\u0027s in bold on the slide because this is something that\u0027s changed less and naming came out where the new draft talking about how to encode the tear tear level in their draft it\u0027s a nice change so we took the encoding out of our draft we\u0027re just using theirs because it\u0027s actually simpler to merge the encoding schemes in a way that makes more sense for us is so that we don\u0027t have to actually manage that piece of it for ting optimization or forward optimization of flooding essentially we\u0027re using neighbors neighbors if you\u0027ve ever read the man a mobile ad hoc network work this is very similar to that in that you\u0027re using neighbors neighbors and you\u0027re deciding which neighbor of yours can reach all of your two hops and only flooding in a way allows one of your neighbors that can reach all of your two hops to reflect all of their peers or all of their intermediate system neighbors this is now this is another change in the document we used to have a do not reflect it and some other stuff and we have changed this to using the local LSP in 7356 so it seems simpler to do go ahead AC beat me up at the mic that\u0027s a C\u0027s job should I back up and wait one I guess since he referred to me I need no introduction who needs no introduction this seems like this repurposing of the scoping scoping of the it\u0027s really area information and you\u0027re repurposing scoping it at the link level to limit flooding it seems like kind of a strange mechanism yeah it there but it\u0027s the simplest way to go about it it seems like to me the main problem you run into with eius eius is there\u0027s no header bits remaining to do anything with so you can do different mac addresses which lubricates it on lists or you could do a new LSP type which is what link local flooding basically does or there\u0027s other games you can play but essentially since there\u0027s no header bits to play with you know it\u0027s like it\u0027s there are very limited options here but you still have to use it you use the information at an area scope even though the it\u0027s actually a link-local only yes but correct yes but you have to treat the received LSP as if it\u0027s a normal LSP but you simply don\u0027t set this SRM bits right so you don\u0027t reflet it that\u0027s "
