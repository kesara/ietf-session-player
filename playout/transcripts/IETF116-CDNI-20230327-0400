Today is Monday March twenty seventh. One Pm local time, And so I greatly appreciate everyone's participation here. Some of you that are remote, have either very early in the morning or will they very, very early in the morning. So greatly appreciate it. Thanks everybody. Got a tagged agenda, so I'm gonna keep moving forward. Let's see if I can do a a next slide here. Okay. It's see here. Perfect. Alright. So note well, And I really mean it noted well. Everything is out here so, like, wanna read all the details there, but just be aware of the It policies on your contribution. Alright. So next slide, Few tips.

Most of you are probably pretty familiar with those agenda and meeting preparations, and if there are any issues, technical support, etcetera? And with that, let me kind of walk you through the agenda. We really have So the agenda back for two hours, And largely, the discussion is gonna be in two sets. One is the we've got a lot of working group documents There are three of them that we're gonna be talking through the session here today? And then the second part is there are several new submissions So we will be covering set of three new submissions and Glenn will get also give an overview of those three before we go into the each other the individual documents of glen will walk through what the overall objective is and what they are. And then individual contributors well and a alfonso and Ben will talk through specific items. And on the working group documents, obviously, So the one we wanna talk about is the delegated credentials and christ staff, will kick us off kick us off the conversation there. And then we've got the Cd triggers. Hopefully, ned is on the bridge as well. So he'll talk through that. And then capacity edward advertisement extensions, then we'll cover those. We have those two major groups of discussions, and then we also have open mic and then we'll wrap up. So with that said, thing I'm gonna have pass it over to Kevin for the other parts of the agenda items that we wanna cover today. Starting with milestones."

I think it's pretty much done just waiting to get processed So congratulations there. Hopefully, that will complete soon. We did send out the working group last call, which we'll discuss in the next slide. The acne delegation draft, that leaves us with the three other items currently in our milestones, the the triggers, the sub delegation and the capacity advertisement, which we will talk about today.

We've been working on this draft for many, many, many years. It's nice to see it finally get to the get to the finish line. There's a couple days left in the last call if you have any thoughts questions comments, please post it to the list. Otherwise, I think the draft is in pretty good shape. We've talked a lot. We've done a lot of iterations on it. And if there are no objections, we will move to submit to the Is shortly after Id f one sixteen. So please go read it and send out any comments.

So the scope is about well the document defines two objects, one I and the one Object, which enables the h Delegation using dedicated credentials. So we have those two objects last meeting, there was a discussion on how what the proposal is. And what how to... How those two objects were, So or I have some detailed example about that in the next slide. And so the current draft, which has submitted like, two or three weeks ago, so it reflects the current proposal. And well, there were small updates regarding more typos and formulations. Next slide.

So if we do to the next slide, So the... There was a discussion really about how do we handle expiry and how do we cook with the renewal of the credentials. From here now the ideas that the Object is not used to Cope Aria renewal. It's really up to the upstream cdn to remember when the dedicated credential it pushed to the downstream Cdn expire, and it is up to the to push those new credentials to the Downstream where needed and the Object is we just here to announced that the downstream sedan is capable of or handling a a certain number of dedicated credentials. On the right here, you have a a example workflow where you have in in step three, you have just these downstream again, which announces the number of dedicated credentials reported instead for the Upstream cdn pushes the dedicated credentials using emi mri object then the... There was credentials I used. And at some point, there are some dedicated credential there spray, and then the upstream skin can and push new dedicated credentials to the announcements here. So...

Send another a bunch of comments Obviously, we should address those. Sanjay. Could you go back one slide, please? One thing here is with respect to the metadata interface pushing. Cdn l does not have a push metadata interface. Right? We have a triggered pull So I think perspective, we may want to just clean up that language with back to C I, but we can obviously make that generic to handle I know open caching may have a push based interface that they're using and and that's fine. But I think, we can clean that up. There are a bunch of knit that I I passed along. But otherwise, I think the draft looks pretty good. After having the discussion last time about what that metadata object will do I... I'm okay with that. I think there's... I think we're a little... We we probably have to do a couple of revisions before we can get to a last call, but I don't see any major blockers. From for my personal opinion. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Thanks.

The clarifying question I have is that you you talk about the the number of maximum number of credentials supported that's not that's not any hard limit. Right? On on the Dc side, it's not tied to the number of servers either. Correct? Because and you talk about there's there's a allows the Dc to announce the maximum number of delegated credentials supported So is there any hard limit there? But do you mean by how limit... I mean, yeah it's just announcing that well as a downstream again, And if you give me, like, ten dedicated queries, I can handle them. I know where to deploy them that let's it's the idea behind it. Right. But so if the... If the Uc decides give you twenty or more. So that's what I'm trying to say. There's there's no there's no limit on your side. It it then you didn't want to use it I guess the upstream team can do that, but the the downstream won't use them. That's my interpretation. Because they would just... I mean, they they that it doesn't need more than can this example? Three. Okay. Alright. That's that's all I had Thanks for clarifying. Okay. Okay.

Alright. That should hopefully popped up for everyone? Yep. Okay. So this is this should be relatively brief. So I'm just gonna cover a summary of what this draft is four what it does very quickly, and then we're gonna get into the revisions that were made in the latest version. So capacity extensions, the whole idea is to allow the downstream to communicate to the upstream how much traffic it can accept so that the upstream can make appropriate traffic delegation decisions. To facilitate this we've created two different objects. Capacity limits, which specifies both a hard and a soft cap for various types of limits based on what you can see on this slide here. The most common of which would likely be you know, egress bits per second. And then To go along with that, we've also defined a telemetry object which allows reference to an external telemetry source. So that the upstream can get feedback."

    "startTime": "00:18:00",
    "text": "On the downstream view. Of the current delegated traffic. In addition to that external mechanism, there's also an in band property in the capacity limits object called current which allows specifying a point in time value. Along with the rest of the limit objects. So those together allow inform traffic delegation decisions. This is just a brief example of what that object looks like. It's relatively straightforward. And none of this has really changed. Since the the previous draft. Only thing that we've done based off the discussion on the mailing list. Is remove this scope object that used to be present here So right now, you know, that this can be associated with the footprint like any other capability In the prior draft, we had an object called capacity limits scope. Which allowed a more fine grained stopping mechanism. Based off of a host name or service Id or property Id. The feedback. On the mailing list with that? This is perhaps not the appropriate place to do this. Could apply across other objects. So we decided to pull that out of the draft. People are already implementing this capacity limits object right now. And I don't think there's any reason to let this stand in the way of the draft. If any if we do develop up some other more generic mechanism, it always be applied to the subject. In the future like it's applied to anything else."

I think the draft is definitely looks better but there's still some questions, but mh. I living in the right direction we figure this out. Yeah. And I definitely appreciate your thorough and detailed feedback. So, yeah. That that's that's right. So I'll... You know, I'll do another revision of the draft. I encourage everyone, please take a look through it and add your own comments as well to the mailing list. And I'm hoping, you know, with the next draft we can proceed forward with this. So we'll we'll we have plenty of time to meet the milestone for it. And given that people are implementing this already, I you know, I don't think we should we should wait. So you know, I'll get the feedback incorporated get the new draft out and or the new revision of the draft out. And I guess, I know the next step is a is a working group last call or or what do we do after this? Once we have once we've got it to a point where we think it's ready, then we'll do a last call and and we submit but I think we'll probably need to do a couple revisions I I did have one question.

Is that something that you have an idea on that you're that you're going to define, or is that something that we may need to pull out So the configuration right now is a defined as a, like generic container object. So it can be used to reference any external service because everyone has their own telemetry sources. And we didn't wanna bog down this draft with defining configuration for you know all of the dozens of possible to telemetry services that people are using. So instead it's a generic property container that can hold whatever is necessary to you know, to communicate the things that are needed to talk to those services. I guess my concern is that as an object that has no actual definition don't know how to des serial it. Right? I don't know how to actually process it. And from an interoperability standpoint, that's a problem. Is it something that you could make a generic string? Or that... And then the parsing is, you know, up to whoever needs to not parse it. But from a basic Json parsing perspective, I can do something with it. I I mean, could you elaborate on why you can't parse a generic Json object? Well, I guess I don't know how to validate it. I don't know what fields it should have whether And and I guess you're saying I don't I shouldn't care, but it feels a little funny to me. Yeah. I can understand that perspective. I think though if if you know, the alternative like you're saying is we define it, But here's a... You know, here's a property that's a string that can contain your service specific configuration. Like, okay, you can validate that this is a string, but you're still not validating the configuration of that service. So in my view, I would see them as equivalent."

I think Chris, limits just point out on the chat that if it is just a string people just put the Json This is sub object inside this string. Okay. Yeah. An eighty percent chance But I'll take that as Chris is okay with a generic object. But, yeah. I I I'll I'll definitely take a look at the the language surrounding perhaps I don't know if we should really include a usage example with a service. That's not defined in the spec.

There is is that the subject that can be and checked pretty instead of the Okay. Having other way around. I believe it's sufficient. This is... Whoever again, we haven't touch the original structure of the protocol itself. We just change the object. Don't and if somebody think it's it's if we can discuss it offline and if we think it's it neither who can do that to work on that. But it's open a window phone a very large set of changes."

Right? The original design was to be purely dressed full, a purely respirator interface and you know, you have you get back an Id for a ass object that you can pull. Yeah. I think it would be a big change, we could think about it, but as Near said, do we want to couple that with the current changes? We can discuss it if it's if it's a critical feature. And actually, it's this is another sample where extensions can be used. Okay. So one they can may define the extension of okay, report the completion to this endpoint the completion of the day to the table we can define such an extension and some Cd sedan would support it and some other and other would not And this is a great example. So for a look... I we can do that. How can we use that extension Good point. Okay. So but that said glenn you might just stay on here because your next to go here. Yeah. Hi. This will be very brief. I just wanted to kind of put the next couple of presentations in context for where we are with the s Configuration interface project, so go ahead next slide. Yeah. So, you know, when Started, look can get to how we configure the open caching systems. We started looking at general commercial Cd and open caching systems together and realized it was the same set of problems pretty much.

The idea is do this work within the Sv, but then you go ahead and share it back into the that's what we're starting to do now. So next slide. Yeah. So July twenty twenty one is when we submitted our first draft here, which we now with the two revisions on that, we let it I. We got really good feedback a lot from Kevin. Thank you very much. It was just a monster way too much stuff in there. It was really a set of Mi objects going beyond the relatively small my objects that originally done an in r c a zero zero six. We took that feedback to her? We did publish shortly after their our first version Configuration interface a multiple part document that had all of these extensions in it So the part two doc really was a mirror of that that original Draft. And a simple configuration Api which is pretty much the metadata interface from more c eight zero zero six with a few additional get methods to to get by individual host. But also, I think was it was Adam pointed out earlier. Push extension was added. For an upstream Cdn to push metadata into a downstream Cdn interestingly, the new capabilities here discussed for the triggers, you know, you use a trigger As suppose to push out of data.

Three pieces are gonna go in today that you'll hear next. Then there'll be another round of metadata, interface objects definitions, for f one seventeen. Next slide. Going to see in the chat here can't remember it was so long ago that see line was started. I think it was twenty eleven. Yep. So the two o standard for the Sdk configuration interface we'll have this metadata model extension is now broken up into multiple ports, like we talked about the three in red or the three of that the guys will talk about today, but there are a set of these. Now since these were originally done in one dock, there are some cross references. We're trying to d them have the dependencies be loose and if depend... There may be cases where the dependencies are only in an example. Across references, and we'll try to clean some of that up and make sure we're properly referencing the other documents. As Sv a does more work on proposing more new metadata interface objects our policy has been if there's some other long oklahoma for those documents, like logging is a good example. We're gonna have a logging standard spec and we'll define metadata interface objects over there.

But what context you allow them in? And also possibly allowed values and allowed properties that's a work in progress. We're also starting to look at a set of Apis and interfaces that work with some, you know, popular devops ops tools like terra form, and allow you to d configuration publishing from deployment right now on our push interface that we added that simple interface pushing metadata data from an upstream City and to a downstream Cdn. Sort of implies publishing it to them and or by the way go alive was that there's no way to sort of stage you to put it into a staging environment or increment to lead deploy at Blue green, nothing like that. So we wanna to start looking at getting into that role of things. Next one. Yeah. And this is the von. Just this sort of puts all the the the parts of the Sv configuration interface spec in context, basically, the Fc sci advertisement, moving from downstream City and Upstream Cdn we cover some of that in in parts two and five with the spec. A content provider pushing metadata in That is the simple interface part three.

To add additional Mi generic metadata objects, And this predictor draft is gonna focus on configuration options for setting cash control. Between an upstream Cdn or Uc and then dc. And there were five components to the presentation today. And I cash policy. Allows you to configure the internal and external refreshing policy. And my object that allows for a caching of negative responses. An additional m I objects that will allow for a caching of stale or stale objects within the downstream Cdn. There's also a small addition to allow the cash k to be configured in the downstream Cd.

There's the internal caching policy, and the external caching policy So how does the downstream City and itself. One to cash particular object and how does it want to pass be caching information to and external user. There also attributes to allow you to force those back cash policy set the true Otherwise, the cash policy set up by the origin. We'll take take hold. Next one down. So in addition to positive caching, we want to be able to deal with negative caching As you can see here, the negative cash policy actually contains a cash policy sub object. Just for consistency. And the negative cash policy lists allows be upstream to list out a set of error codes that will that the cash policy will then be applied to. So an example here, we've listed out four zero four five zero three five zero four. As negative responses and then the cash policy that would apply would be in this example internal cash policy of five seconds. And we want to force that setting."

Under these conditions So you can set the stale while rev, attribute which instruct the downstream Cd to serve out potentially stale, response while it's rev upstream. To avoid latency during that refresh. You can also set the stale of error. So if there's is an error in this example, a five x seller while trying to refresh a resource the downstream Tv can go ahead and respond with the stale resource. And then finally, a failed refresh T l setting allows you to configure how if we have one of these conditions how long do you want to continue serving that stale response before retry to refresh upstream. Next one now. So m I computed have key. This is the generic metadata object that will allow us to handle more sophisticated or complex cache cases. And in this case, you're able to set up the computer cache key to be based on expression And as you can see in the note below, the expression is out a scope for this particular draft"

And if those conditions are met, you can set the bypass cash attribute to true. Indicating that the particular request will continue through the downstream Cd to the upstream. And one thing to note is any existing cash content will not be elected as part of this test object. So I think that covers all material. As we have some questions that came up previously. We can either handle those now or we can jump into questions from this session. So I I don't see anything on the queue yet. And I have to review the draft. I know so gonna hold off my comments. Okay. I know we got some back from Kevin earlier today. Yeah. I just got around to reading it. I apologize for for the late read, but I did send out a bunch of comments.

So in building this, we wanted to have two teenager modes of operation. One is we wanted to allow a simple mechanism that allowed everything to happen in band. Without configuration for external services. So, you know, we didn't want the parties to have to outside of the existing interfaces to exchange something before secrets could then be exchanged. So to do that, we have the first mechanism based off of x five zero nine certificate. So using public private keypad pairs, the certificate can be shared by one party is then used to incorporate values on the other side. In addition to that because many organizations utilize existing services for accessing secrets. We have a reference mechanism that points to an external service. The current draft defines a configuration object for Hash corp vault key value store. But I think the attention will expand that over time incorporate other services or also include something like a generic mechanism like the telemetry object in the capacity draft.

So the supported modes are the embedded the embedded model where we have encrypted values in Cms format. So that's a Rf c that's been around for very long time, originally targeted for exchange of encrypted email. Which we're utilizing here because it's fairly straightforward. We also support a clear text format for testing purposes so that allows you to just utilize the secret value object anywhere where it's needed in other objects. But just include the value as a plain text string. And then the third example here is a reference to an external hash corp vault instance. Where we have to specify the endpoint. Next slide, please. Secret value is how you actually reference the secrets inside of the places where those references need to happen. So this could be inside of a property, for example, in an Mi object that contains a header off token it could be inside of an Mi object that contains an encryption key for an encrypted value in a log file. So in the case of an external reference, we specify a path So you utilize that in conjunction with the stewart configuration.

Stripped of the header and footer in embedded directly in a string value. In the secret certificate object. So the the draft doesn't tell you right now, how to handle your P I. So you know, that that's think out of scope for for this draft but, you know, they this could be handled in for instance instance in a testing environment, which self science certificates in a production environment via private Tk I infrastructure with a private C. Or could even be you know, an a third party c. That's accepted by both participants that science the certificates. Next slide. And then to facilitate doing this a bidirectional manner so that secrets can be shared from both sides. There are capability objects that wrap the Mi objects? So the same functionality can be done from the downstream side via the Fc interface. And that's pretty much the whole thing. It's pretty straightforward. Two simple mechanisms for exchange of secrets. It might be a little hard to envision why we need to without seeing some clear examples of usage in the context of these new Mi objects.

And so I get nervous when I hear that we're gonna build something on top of this and and maybe I I just have to wait and see what that is, but I I just wanna voiced that particular concern with respect to how deep we go into like, specifying a Url that points to Hash corp. Okay, fine. That's probably know, perfectly okay. But once we get into other things where we're specifying keys, and then we start best like how to get keys we start specifying how to use keys, it gets a little dicey. I understand that... That's why the messages themselves are based off an existing Rf that's battle tested for you know, fifteen years or something now. We're not doing anything new here. We're just utilizing an existing facility for exchanging encrypted messages. So we're not fully finding our own thing. Right. And so and So the the... What's presented here seems okay to me it just I get a little nervous on where we might be going with it. But okay. Lot...

You have to indicate to the Dc And there there are some of those... If exchanges that involve moving around keys that are actually sensitive. Do you... You assigning token as it stands?

And I don't know that it's necessarily gonna be a good thing if we hand waive the important parts to avoid doing them properly. Yes. Yeah. I I'm not sure I agree entirely with that line of reasoning. We also don't specify how the parties authenticate to each other to these objects in the first place? And if that's a similar issue, is how do you establish trust between the participants. That's currently also out of band. So we're gonna answer this question of how do we how do how do you get your counterpart party's certificate in a way that you can trust.

It's a topic of discussion that came up in several discussions and war groups we have at open cash working group at S, so kind of the mini projects that"

    "text": "borne out of that in recent months. So what the motivation him to begin with to to summarize the high level, right? Is that we see that multiple use cases have emerged. To that to kind of require more advanced for capabilities that the think have been explored in open caching and and or Cdn and I until now. And just some example of kind of business use cases that this is where we're seeking to have multiple distinct access net works to be managed on the common Dc management. While still distinguishing and differentiating between different access networks. Differentiated Cdn and layers. So there's a whole topic of kinda last mile slash edge cash layers and how you manage them. And within Vc, with potentially different functionality and coverage. It can also be dynamic. As well as various geography related requirements that exists in Cdn. For example, like, topics like Gdpr and so on. So all of them gonna rely and rely on some form of footprint to be used. And kind of what we have in kind Cd and I today and we could kind find a bit lacking. Because sort of right now, footprint really are kind of we say We really mean footprints and capabilities, but that's really capabilities. And footprints kind of an afterthought thought. What we need is ability to have footprints to be used metadata data, both inside Fc sci done today in capabilities, but also outside of it and it can do in configuration interface, slash metadata data, a new and a new other of effort that we're starting like and we'll be bringing forward here. I'm sure"

    "text": "in the future, like cash management logging and so on to be able to refer to to these capabilities in in a footprint a context in a consistent manner. So have a way that to have scope of that footprint to be global as opposed to right now it lives with within individual capability. And that cannot be used as kind of consistently across different places in in the interfaces. Other things that we we found like other the thing that we more complex footprint logic. Because kind of it's often we we found that kind of, you have to say complex things like all users in particular country, but exclude this and that, but don't exclude this kind of, so various complex boo logic. As well as dynamically changing footprints that are kind of change often. Especially in the context of, let's say last mile or edge caching where kind of coverage may change quite dynamically. So we need a good support for that. So all of that kind of bringing us forward kind of the following draft and again just submitted this this morning. So our that's initial submission. But the changes we're proposing are kind of at high level are as follows. So we want to extend Fc I to actually advertise footprints separately from capabilities. In a way that those footprints to make them accessible, kind of floor bose one common advertising so you can actually get all those footprints in one Api call and have, but also have individual footprints to accessible as well. So they can be referred to kind of as as objects. And this advertising, we want to be because clearly, there is a case for kind of at least couple of layers of benefits footprints within one another."

    "text": "Adding name play support. And I'll expand on that way if we have time today. And supporting caching really because that's a way to support dynamic advertising. So you can publish of footprint definition that's valid for some amount of time and in combination with individual footprint advertising, Uc can pull query those footprints cares about more often than for example, others. If you have more dynamic footprint, that's the definition. And you you you want the query event because you use it, you can query that every nine hundred seconds, but query others once a day or even more as needed. So provide this kind of for feedback cache logic as it's as what we're looking to do. So as a result, I think the overall kind of Cdi operation mode kind of changes that from thing now kind of I think what's implied and maybe I also I haven't seen like actually explicit referral to them, but I think the the intention is that capabilities can be refreshed periodically but not too often. And I think with introducing footprint advertising that may change more dynamically we're kinda want to have kind of as part of the good bootstrap process to have separate retrieval of footprints. That are named, the advertising and I'll show the details how it's done. And then allow refreshment of those cash or for footprint advertising as needed including individual ones. To support that those things and another goals that mitsubishi I mentioned before, we're introducing two new types One is a name footprint. So that's ability to refer to footprint that been advertised kind of into this new process."

And the second type is actually tapping the Cd and I fresh language with the mel, to define a footprint in a complex way yet keeping that quite concise. And that potentially may super proceed or compliment. The other work has been done around for Union. So because I think the mel kind of goes well, you know, above and beyond that providing bull and the nor in combination and expressions kind of powerful expression language. So that may be something that can super proceed for Union draft that's making us way to the group. And last change is another implementation detail that came up is that we see that some of the complex footprint types actually are I'm resolved. So when you say good things like country, so it's which a good thing to say, well, here is all endpoints that come from Us kind of it's a match, but what is Us can be subjective because it in reality implementations, use different G databases. And we found that in some cases they may not match, which may resolve in two kind of delegation issues, mismatch of basically uc and do not agree what Us is or even in some cases, which Ip address belongs to which As So they need to to have some consistency. So we want end introduce some of that to the extent we can. There's certainly limitation there So... But kind of alan hold on a second. I I think I see Ben on the queue. I'm not sure if Ben has some comments here or benjamin you wanna wait until the end No. I I have a separate topic. Okay. Alright. So I"

    "text": "Right. So... Yeah, just to to delete the time. So the proposal is to allow within Fc sci to kind of have resources that you can actually query advertising of footprints, also individual footprints and names spaces. And on the right you see an example of how that advertising would look like. You see the new type of footprint can called dane footprint, which provides the name, the uri eye, the the kind of caching information expiration. And and the definition. Kind of and accordingly, with the... With the advertising, including caching information. Basically, here's my definition of footprint it's good for another twenty four hours or nine hundred seconds. What have you then... So each definition prompt was its own expiration attribute allowing for differentiated query. Right? So you in bootstrap this by retrieving initial advertising getting all the footprints in. And then refresh them as they expire And also it may skip the footprint it doesn't care about. If if there footprint that's not using for its own kind of request handling link. It may actually not query this too often. Right? And and certainly, but even it does. So query that individual footprint separately from others at have longer to tl. Caching, introduce E. Right? And and just to walk into through an example, right so so on the right, imagine that you have a footprint that as I mentioned that's let's say you have a common Dc that actually operates to this... To this thing geographies may footprint for Us and Brazil? And for Us, it may have a separate software within it, which is"

And the the purpose to define an actual x listed an ear as opposed to let's say, for example, as you see in a routing table of that footprint definitions combine different types So it's not necessarily clear without actually stating what Eric is which footprint is more precise. So E is there to define call the the the sentencing. And the assumption is that the parent footprint includes all children footprints within it. And the matching is big ambiguous. So within same tree, well, why the Ip will match kind enough we'll we'll match Brazil but will not match You s. So that... And that's kind of up to dc to to define I got in the on ambiguous way. When... And when it does and publish of this advertising. So name spaces, kind of... So names space will show that we have multiple pipes of of advertising. On the right, right. So and the motivation here is that the the the breakdown may be different depending on type of traffic, for example, And type of traffic can be many things. It's can be the kind of individual host name it can be kinda combination of them, can be a prefix so rather than tying that kind of into the advertising, we kind we provide a name space, which can be then reference from the the metadata data objects like, oh, for this traffic, I'm using this name space. An example of motivation for that, for example, that you may have situation where Dc handles traffic For example, always centrally"

Just an example of what we can achieve with the mel expression. I'm I'm kind of quite quite excited about this. So I kind of I think that you've seen that that kind of those as we build kind of complex for footprint definitions that can be pretty hairy, right and kind and actually quite lengthy to build it using Json. So using the expression language, you can do first of all, kind of concise and concise definition that kind of can meet various kind of types of logic like, hey, this is this country, but exclude those signer. And or and or kind of match exclude the Ip before six. Include excludes of include the country, but some subdivision code and so on and so forth. Kind of their powerful capability, to do that and we're building on the on the draft that kind of our colleagues submitted submitted and But to support the footprint logic, we need to end to add several variables. It's kind describe not a request in response so who's all done until now, but actually endpoint. Which was the the kind of the endpoint that is initiating the request. And you see on on the left here are the five five variables we're proposing to to add As Id before I six country and some."

Cover coverage of endpoints. Or we actually extend this to to mean also sets of traffic. Within the footprint. So do we actually bill of the kind of various ways that may exist that you can build traffic into this or we build it into separate object and binds and then link them together And this kind of links to what Ben mentioned around capacity that that's the think what one place that think that came up with there others as well. So kind of Do we scope capabilities and object by footprints, that are coverage or and or we extend us stream to mean also traffic subsets in it as well. I think there's a lot of interesting stuff here. I'm looking forward to reading the draft. Think there are some questions as you've as you've mentioned, know, it does it is a departure from what we have traditionally held with respect to what footprints are, what the footprint interface is, what the footprints mean. And I think it's a healthy discussion for us to have but I'd like to read the draft and and I encourage everyone else to read the draft too once it's available."

All the the structure is going to be time Is it out of point pm the Or or not? And when we define Hierarchy key that is there way to say, okay. This is the Us.

I I'd like to give Ben some time to to ask his open my question. I think if we... If we're getting into the details of Alice proposal I'd rather read the draft and take away. So I I'll I'll give just the point, just they also into consideration or the But we fair to this between second, and maybe we need a new footprint that which is a footprint name footprint.

I just wanted to quickly ask about milestones because at the beginning of the meeting, on your decks sanjay J, you said that we had to re charter I think it was with October or August. It one of the two. So given that we're submitting all of these new drafts and we have a lot of activity now. Surrounding them. What are the steps forward to incorporate those as or incorporate the future new work as milestones and continue the working group pass that the re charter deadline. So we can we can change the retry date. That is there based off of the milestones that we have. If we choose to adopt additional drafts and they fit within our existing charter.

We can always re charter. Retry is not necessarily in high of high. As long as it's not like our deadline, like we have to do this by x state or we're done? Okay. Yep. Alright. That was my question.

Please, you know, review the draft, and provide your input into the mailing list because that's important for us to sort of gauge where the interest is and who is implementing it, etcetera. So I think it's very important that folks review it and and provide their drafts. That really help us to sort of, you know, take the next steps and adapt those drafts into the working group. That's one thing. And then I would also say that footprint that Alan has proposed we we we we need to take a look at it really carefully. It may make sense, but something that we need to take a look at it. And then lastly, I would say that Rf c eight zero zero seven bus that new presented, Again, that needs a lot of review. So I'm I'm hoping that between now and before we meet at Ia of one seventeen, we've got some good input Kevin I I will second everything that Sanjay just said. I'd like to thank folks for bringing the new drafts, Glenn, I'll say, it the work is interesting, and and I'm happy to see it and I think we care in the City I working group are happy to take it on.
