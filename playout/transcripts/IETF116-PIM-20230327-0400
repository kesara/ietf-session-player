We have some drafts about p election that I've been sitting around for a long time, we need to Try make progress on those. We we'll have a presentation today for one of those drafts Otherwise, there's actually some Rf seats that have been published store or approved So let's see. So register packing and a start packing, they have both been approved for publication now. I... On a slide here it says revised draft needed on a start packing, but that's like until the status is until today, I think. It's actually approved now. So Yep.

But yeah, I believe that it passed the adoption calls, so make it a wrecking group document. There were some comments about allowing more people to contribute and having more details about his three and so on and and Yeah. Once we welcome come to contribute to to the draft that if they wish.

And then this trick that El alvaro mentioned that putting in explicit bits is not an actual allocation that should be understood as an example to how I might prescribed it because I was sitting there writing my third packing and was really wondering how would I do a nice picture without, you know, being sure that Ar is going to allocate this bit.

Sure. It sounds good. It it meets all the requirements. They said the same thing. And the were included. Including Av overall. And And then at the same time, Lois said, okay, you need to start the process over again and request it. So it sounds like if that was right. We need to...

What what did the prediction of the r seven? Sorry so the r seven imagine between r six and the receivers so so between r six and the receiver there is another router and and just imagine that your P q space rather than terminating on the r six somehow takes you to to the r seven, which is, like two hops away from r two and and you don't have a like, a team adjacency between r two and the r seven.

What is the scope or what exactly we are going to cover in this jar. So there are there are two points which is going to be covered in this draft. One is how exactly we are going to define backup dr r. And why backup B is coming into the picture right now to me, it looks like maybe twenty years back when we define them, that time convergence may not a convergence requirement were not very restricted are very a very strict convergence requirement right now there are applications. Which really want to have a faster than convergence in case of any kind of failure. So that is one part of the. Second part of document talks about when you have a failure, and you move to new dr. What will happen if old dr comes back? Which has a higher priority. So there are use cases are there are deployments where customer really wants that once you have elected someone as Dr r. No matter who is coming in the network. Let it be the Dr r. We don't want any movement across the network. In the last router. So that is a two part, this draft covers, we can go to the next slide. So I'm not going to really talk very long for these a problem statement, I think problem statement is well known that if we have r eight and r line here, on the line, if r eight was the dr r, which failed"

So there are multiple factors which will decide on how fast we can convert Next slide. And having backup dr definitely does help in some of the scenarios where you may end up even doing live life kind of scenario where both of the Dr are receiving the traffic. And since maybe the application is so sensitive that to the traffic that you really don't want to lose any packet In that case, you're okay to burn some extra bandwidth where you get traffic from the both of the side and just last our router decides, who is going to be forwarding on the line. So in this case, when you have any failure on the actual are backup, as soon as it detects all it needs is to open the gate towards access network. And start forwarding. So that is where we really want to have a backup here can we go to the next? Okay. So just to your slide one more line. So one of the procedure, this draft talks about is how exactly we are going to have backup they elected. And we really... I think we really don't need new extension for that because all the procedures you are doing to elect actually r. If you read rerun the same algorithm, and pick the second best dr r that becomes a backup idea for that network. And that's exactly the stuff talks about that we can still use our all the pi protocol procedures where you read algorithm? If you are the second best dr r, you are the backup deal. We can go to the next And second part of draft which talks about is that having h question comes at why why may even we need this ticket. So in this lan. If we have four routers,"

Your our backup dr is going to take over, which is route of three in this case. Maybe if we are using live life kind of scenarios, everything is working fine. Everything is going perfectly fine. Convergence was much faster, than the earlier are the base bim go to the next Now the question comes what will happen when out of four comes back again. And as soon as router four comes back, it is going to announce its priority as a four hundred. Router three was d r at that time, maybe two was elected as a backup dr r. Now four came which is supposed to take over as new Dr. As soon as four announces it's priority. Now three has to give up the dr roll. Four has to rebuild the three four has to rebuild all the forwarding states depending on what kind of platform, what kind of basic capabilities, you have, you may have some traffic delay here traffic loss. And this is what many customers are trying to avoid that if new router is coming, we really don't want to give up on that dr role. This is the genuine case. What about if there is a some false spam message comes on the line, with higher d priority. And you ended up giving your Dr role thinking that there is some other team router in the network. And we may go into situation where we are not forwarding at all. And that is where this new procedure is coming in the picture. Next So new procedure what we are trying to do is still trying to keep it as simple as possible not very much have you wait protocol extensions here. It is initial alexa remains as is So we network comes up. We do that Dr r alexa based on our dr r priority,"

And that is where this new extension is coming that can we the last post off dr priority maybe ten or fifteen. Which we will use as a mute. Where once you are dr, you hold on that max priority. And you get that max priority to get assigned And now you will start announcing that as your priority. So what will happen in that case, no matter which router is coming and going. Auto whether it is accidental config or maybe some genuine attack you are not going to give the dr priority. Next I think this we already covered. And same thing is with assert matrix because this d r D r and they are the one who really defines that who was who's going to be forwarding into the lan. So whoever becomes the dr r at once and if we want to have this is to give behavior being there. So we adjust both of these metrics to max so that they... The router which is Dr will never give. Next So implementation we already have implementation for a sticky security dr behavior. And I think similar mechanism there are some other vendors which who... They said that they are also kind of considering to implement the same behavior of his security on. Next Dina know? This is Dino. In terms of the backup Dr, Did you spec...

So we're gonna present this new protocol This is first time we're presenting it at Called gap. That's fine. So what is it? It's a totally decentralized multi cast group allocation protocol. And the reason I say totally is nobody else has involved in allocating the groups then the receivers and sources that are participating in the application. Okay? There's no central entity that allocate the group addresses. And group addresses are allocated and are guaranteed to be unique unique among the gap speakers.

It works on a sub single subnet as well as a layer two infrastructure. It's a layer layer three infrastructure. If the layer three infrastructure doesn't support native multi cast, it will work over overlays that support multi cast. Okay. It can coexist with other group allocation protocols because we'll use a Gap range that doesn't conflict with those other allocation protocols. Okay. When native multi cast is not available, overlays will be used. Next So how does it work? Multi cast source and receiver knows participate in the gap product call an application specific group name. This is the key to the protocol. The group name will always map to a unique group address. And when a bunch of applications say one audio group or another video group wanna be able to run and and and join and receive with multi sources that they'll all use the same group name and they're further they're guaranteed to use the same group address at the network layer. The group address is a hash of the group name. Gaap notes will send claim messages to a well known Aya allocated gap group make sure that there's no collisions in the addresses. Claim claim message contains the group name, the group address and a timestamp of when the group address was created by the first either send or receiver. That's So claim messages are sent to every one minute. If a notice part of a group name that receives a message For a group name, it resets the one minute timer.

If a node uses a group address found in a claim for a different group name, That is defined as a collision. So if you have food, and you have bar and they happened to hash A very rare occasion if they both hash the same group address, we have a collision and we have to resolve the collision. Okay. Notes that detect the collision set a one second random delay timer so somebody can trigger to tell the guy that he he collided. So everybody else did noticed that there was a collision would back off the random lay timer allows the first guy where the timer expires to send it just like Igm p works, and so everybody else suppress it. So if somebody collide, you don't have n minus one, message is being said, you only have a single message. And that's why the other nodes with the same group address press sending trigger claims. Notes part of the collided group address will rehash. So what happens if you have two group names, Food and bar, and they both shot two fifty six clyde the same group address, the guy who has the timestamp who's was the first creator gets to keep the group and the other guy has to rehash and the hash is the group name plus one, the ask string of group plus one. And we'll do that up to four times if there's a case where there's more than four collisions for the same group. K. Next. So what happens at the network partitions and the group...

Do you wanna take it now or How about if I take it right before the? Okay. I think I'm almost almost done. Okay. Next. Protocol scale, like I said, there was only one claim per group regardless of the number of notes using the group name and there's all at most one claim for collided group Collided addresses are not used converge quickly since collision detector detector triggers the claim. Next. Security the way we So I I built an implementation of the protocol myself and they decided to use the cipher charge out twenty cipher so all messages are encrypted on the network. So somebody can't inject... I mean, if you read the protocol specification, you could hash you can take s two fifty six and hash the group name and you know what the group address. But we're gonna try to keep all the messages encrypted if possible. We'll use a default key will be the group name. Okay. And it can run in hybrid mode so some notes could use plain text other notes could use cipher text as well. And the protocol could actually detect bad actors, and a bad actor is defined as somebody sending too fast. I'm sending too many claims or actually forging some of the fields in the in the packet. Like timestamp Okay. And and by doing that, so So this is a work in progress is that we're gonna try to do some re keying. If we find out there's a significant amount of bad actors. Can we go for a period of time"

Overlays can help suppress bad actors because overlays that are doing head end replication could actually do admission control on receivers. So we could actually make the network more secure by using an overlay rather than need a multi cast but. I don't wanna say that to this group. Regroup could also happen. If there's too many people that are like, signal jamming the group, we could actually regroup as well by using plus one plus two or plus three of the hat. Next So we decided to put this as part of an Api So we believe the private protocols is lightweight enough where you could actually we run the application library. So the application would go ahead and import a library, the gap library called the gap to start the start the protocol operation and then supply a callback function and the callback functions there in case the group changes the application knows that the change happened. And it's a pretty simple Api. Those just four of them as you see there. The application would say allocate for, you know, my group, which is the group name. And gets returned back in a group address and it starts doing starts it's receiving or sending to the group. As it wishes. And when it's done, it can release of course the application could allocate multiple groups if that's what how it's design. Okay. Next So like I said, I did implementation of this, and I built the cap library python and I also built an application really simple application called Echo send and echo receiver. And we're gonna demo it now we have a lot kind of a live demo recorded live demo. And so basically what Echo sender does is simply just sends this message periodically, and then the receivers will receive it. They're that running the Era application."

But it might be hard to run ga per s, on Ss because then you have to specify the sources and that's going to require some centralization. Yeah. I would I would I would think about application they are flooding by just, you know, all the routers in such small domains have a gap forward and think how to build that In the meantime thing, it's a small domain, but we want this to work This is a generalized mechanism that we wanna work wide area. questions how wide area.

What didn't work? And and how this mechanism is different than what Str sdr to do. So it's pretty much the same mechanism, but it it's done at the application layer as as you know. And it was also built not only as an address allocation system, but also as human being rounded views system to publish you know, groups and content and that sort of stuff. So This is this is the thing this is kind of the revelation that we said is that we multi cass was always depending on things that are above it's layer when this is really a network layer function you know and how do routers in the uni has will know which way send packets. It's because the address our advertised through the. So we we're thinking that we kind of missed this a long time ago where we should have tried to done do something like this at the network layer, so it was self contained. I mean, if I wanted to do this demo with names and not addresses, I would have to bring edward... It's a Ping demo. Why would I have to bring up Str sdr to do this?

We want we want ga to depend on the multi cast service in the network and not have to depend on the protocol mechanisms of anyone given protocol. Fine. Okay. So I'll just wrap up or do can I wrap up? Okay. So the point about collisions is we did some simulation and these collisions are very rare. And it turns off for Ip six, it'll never happen your lifetime because we're gonna cash to two to the thirty two addresses because we have more address space fry six. And it's true that we want them to not collide at a twenty three bit space because we're running over a layer two network. But, you know, this width the the hash the uniqueness can vary as well. So what we did is we did we went through one million groups. And we said only two percent of the time, we had a collision And on the right hand side, you could see that collisions, most of the clinicians have with one collision five hundred happened with two collisions and eight happen with three collisions. I blew it up ten x to ten million and we had a twenty percent chance. But remember that's actually hash to twenty four bits."

What you could look at this is there's kinda two documents that we have proposal status right now, which is One is, how do you allocate the multi cast addresses? And then the second is how do you advertise what those addresses are. For applications to figure out what should be using. So next slide, please. So to provide a little bit more information about where all this came from, the environment that I work with is more layer two networks. With devices that are different capabilities. So you might have a hundred megabit sensor and a one gigabit sensor and you don't want to have the stream from the gigabit sensor overwhelm, the length the hundred megabit sensor. So the way that we handle this is we put those the multi cast stream coming from those devices onto different addresses and then use multi cast snoop in a default block mode to prevent those streams from going off the links that can't handle them. So you can kinda see this illustrated here. This is problem with a standard switch because Standard switch will just forward everything by default. The hundred megabit sensor gets overwhelmed. Next slide. So the answer here is to to block that using managed switch and the multi cast new thing. Devices will only request the strains that they are capable of handling. So it's kinda well known to determine ahead of time that that stream for the radar is gonna be a gigabit stream or that that's stream from that other sensor hundred megabit, and you only... As a device are gonna request what you're capable doing. Next slide? Okay. So as we get got into further, well how do you allocate these addresses dynamically ran it to some problems. So This is the format of a link local Iv... Ip Uni has address, you have the interface Id right there that's gonna become important later as we get into the address allocation. Next slide."

You have the first Rf each eighty four, which has a hundred and twelve bed group Id and then thirty three zero six broke that up a little bit more and you see that there's a group Id associated with that. And then finally, you're getting into the dynamic allocation, of the the Ip six multi cass address Ro four four hundred and eight nine is really what works well for our environment and that essentially, any device that uses Slack to get a an address will have a a set of multi cast addresses at its disposal that it can then use to transmit on. So that group Id or the Ii right there, that sixty four bit black there. That that's kinda what is specific to that interface or that address. And then the group ideas what vary for for different streams coming from that specific device. Next slide. So with the address guidelines here. You've got specifies group Ids are are kind of broken into three different blocks. Four point one two. Those are gonna be more of the pre allocated ones. Four point three gets into the night dynamic, Ip six multi test addresses, which is gonna be and the hex eight zero zero to F f range. Next slide? So the problem that we ran into though is when you go to transmit on Ethernet, you take the the the the Mac address the destination Mac address that you're using on Ethernet, is gonna be the first two r three three three three and the last four test or the last four tests of the Ip six multi guest address.

So, essentially, the different nodes that can generate the different Ip six like local addresses, different Ip six. Multi cast addresses, but then they end up with the same Mac address. That's a problem. Next slide? So in developing and having the original discussion around this, it was kinda interesting in that the environment that we operate in is very different. And so I wanna kinda go through and establish a baseline for for where what we have as. So zero configuration, most of our customers don't have an expertise on network configuration and don't really want to. No internet connection. So there's no possibility of using some sort of outside server to help coordinate all this stuff. Networks are typically single subnet although we're seeing or we're planning for networks going to multiple subnet nets at some point in the future. And then what we need is we need a unique Ethernet destination address. And the reason is because the switch parts that we have don't really support source specific multi cast address. So we basically have to have it each multi need to have a different destination address. So looking at Rc c four five four one talks about how different multi cast vendors are handling. This and most of them, they're only looking at the Ip six destination address. So... And then we also need a mechanism that's decentralized avoiding a single point of failure. So there is an existing solution for dynamic assignment, which is Mac path that that relies on a server. And then we also need to account for multiple streams coming from the same host. Next slide?"

The dynamic range was x eighty through hex F f f. So on, basically, we need to sub divide that into different ranges. One of those would be used for mad cap and then the others we could have additional protocols allocated for that such as the the protocol that we're getting to a little bit here, such as gap these this would allow these protocols to operate in parallel without causing collisions with each other. And then Going beyond that, the proposal that we have in the zero comp draft is to use kind of an application of Md S to ensure that the group ideas is unique Dns s is is your configuration technology and it would basically be probing before the initial use and they continually monitoring. So some of the features that we saw in the Gap protocol are also features here and that if you have kind of that network partition and coming together and that that consistent kind of maintaining the viability of the network that's that's a part of this as well. And then, basically, as we saw with Four four nine, the application uses the group Ig Id to generate the links scope multi cast address and then uses the S technique to ensure that that address is not being used at. That level. Next slide? So this is kind of a proposed change to that that"

And then we say see zero through Cf, that's gonna be the S based zero configuration algorithm that's described in the document. And then d zero through F e, f f f f, all of that is for other algorithms. Such as gap. And then the other thing that we thought was important to call out here is that this table does not reflect that with Ip six, there's the solicit of node multi the cast addresses that are using the range f f zero zero all the way through f f f f. And so potentially somebody who's not aware of this we can configure their mad cap server to potentially be allocating addresses that are gonna collide at the ethernet level as well. So we also feel like this this is an important update to to note. Next slide. So basically there's the technique that it uses in order to that the group Id is unique is that it uses a Pt record or just as a note, Dns uses P records for perform worth reverse lookup. So from an example, there if you're wanting to do reverse look on your Ip six address, That's essentially what it would look like. Down there. You got your try six address. And then kinda the... You take that and and take each hex. N and and put it in in reverse. To get that Record. So the proposal uses a P record the layer two address as well. So there's an example there and you're basically doing the same thing. You take each hex ex They and you you separated it with your Dns labels and have new special use domain called east dash add dot arp. And that's what you would then"

You would then choose a different random number. Continue to do that until you get one that's not being used. If you do find one that's something being used, then you publish the east at R record. With with that information instead. Next slide, please.

So you have example that local that's gonna be its host name and then the application would be in front the application dot example dot local.

Including the application in the Pt name field there is what allows you to have multiple applications. On the same host. Each application be responsible for having a different application name.

A third one about the load balance, so typically in Isp isbn neighborhoods, we have some vacancy for protecting parts. So we could leverage on that capacity for receiving traffic from different let's say links towards common destination. The fourth one the situations where they are merging know with different multi services of this could help us to have the an initial transition in in that merging. I'm finally the final one was the multi series migration, so we need to to move from one with service to another so we can do step by step. Without... Let's say losing the the the the service from the from the old service provisions. So just see from one to the other, you know, month way. All of them are applicable for fix on for mobile while for sure. And apart from them, also other use cases are emerging in relationship with the rubber reception of flows. So emphasis liabilities having multiple replica of solution as well to those other use cases. Next, please? So regarding I've seen solution mechanisms, well is the in the document command, we in a different kind of mechanisms? The first one of topic interface so based either in in the channel or the content or the group. So channel, the subscriber or even using priority for the interfaces yeah. According to the some policy that they I network provider could fine The second one will be automatic soon interface selection for this project, we will require probably know.

And yeah other the point of the could interact with the different sorry, the that are with the different proxies so how how we could plan in the overall network, the how the different consume what are the the that are activated and and far so far. Next, please. So regarding the interface selection for the case of the controller well there will be different options either interface based on any specific user. So based on the house Ip of the other packet of the message from the user to subscribe the content. Either in the in the source of or group to be skype, or whatever source for a giving group or whatever all source for group. Also precedence could be defined for this different criteria.

We added the the reference the Poc, we have the reference to the requirements that were were the previous draft so now appearance somebody table in this draft and so so far. So the as for finishing the presentation today. So the point is collect it feedback on the group.

We considering the Ip address they I. Yeah. The message for. Okay. So what it it needed to update the configuration of the ip your address. If we it change on, or or home Gateway way. For ip address. The configuration of the dial subscribe into to Okay. But we are we we will have the join the message joining group we will have the Ip address for the ip from the customer. Okay. So just to use that for for selecting the customer. I understood. And the last question is if is the approach of a subscriber based and If two subscribe connect to the same or a key of switch, which is joined the same channel what it will induce duplicated traffic. This could be you maybe to two different policies. I mean, this could happen. There is a policy for maybe one subscriber in the day saying content. I mean the with the humidifier from one provider or the owner. So yeah, this could happen we understand that this could you be due to different policies. I don't know.

To define the same, but the content is not the same. Only the provider is not the same. Oh. Oh, okay. I got it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for rev this work. We need move on. Toward us. Well, finally no new technology, but some really, really old progress see Next slide. So we we are in the process of trying to update the status of our core protocols. Igm p and Pi and all the other stuff And so Rf eleven twelve is defining the original Ip multi service the host stack of it. And one of the big issues that it has that includes the standardization of Igm version one, and Ig p version one is obsolete, but we still you know, implementations coming up in host that are implementing Ig One because It's the only full Internet standard. Everything else we have v two and v three. Doesn't have that level. Even and even if it gets that level, we still need to retire Igm one, but obviously, we can't retire Ip multi cost. So what do we do? So the proposal in in this document the this is remove Igm version one. That is an appendix And then just do the minor changes that are not bringing any new functionality, but just updating the text as minimally as possible. Next slide, So I already had sometime in twenty one and then got sidetracked with other stuff. So"

Right now, there is no document that defines Ip multi for Ip six. This is only Ip four. And then also introduce the fact that since we introduced Ss, this service is also called any source multi cars. So that term So that's really just, you know, nothing new just updating the text so that it covers the the broader scope. Next slide, Yeah. So so so this I'm coming back with zero one, I converted that into the Md format it's on Github and starting also some of the administrative discussions around that. Next slide, So as far as the work that probably still needs to be done technically. The Ethernet Method for Ip six is an Rf c twenty four sixty two. That is not full standard, So I need to talk with six men if we bumped that up to full standard as well. And then Diana just sent me a long list of, you know, possible Diana text that this document would need in terms of everybody. Referring to eleven twelve would need to be bumped up to referring to eleven twelve bi. And then the whole bloody discussion about the twenty one nineteen language And so there there's a of politics. I'll go faster through this feel free to read up on it and and get back to me So the Trust would like to get copyright and so on. So kind of the bureaucracy when you're trying to update an old Rf from thirty years ago. Next slide, Yeah.

Of non Ip cars packets that wouldn't implement eleven twelve, but which we still don't want to be considered to be multi cast packet and that is the ones with multi sauce addresses and we had some big fun in fixing these fifteen years ago. So So that's one interesting technical point to also discuss with six men Whether that would be appropriate. Next slide? Right. So eighty five zero four host stack recommendations for Ip v six So that also is is a question in terms of whether we should do a paragraph section in eleven twelve is updating that So I was writing down here the details of what may be missing. In that respect, again, I think that's a discussion with six men. What they think about it, whether they would like to see that Next slide, Yeah. So then there's about the the author. So pretty much What we're doing here is something that has been exercised exactly in the same way with the Ip six protocol called standard Rf eighty two hundred, which also goes back multiple different versions in in our case would be one single update from thirty years ago to now or thirty two years. But, yeah, they're all these are crazy administrative things about the trust there. Yeah. And that's pretty much it. Next slide. So So this, I think is really an important update of of our base protocol inventory. So... And and and the main goal of course is that eleven twelve piece. Goes back to be full standard immediately like eleven twelve is and then we get rid of Igm p version one."

You know and So Tore, are you sending a message that Switch vendors should not support Ig v any longer. Oh, yes, Really? Yes. I do. Yes. You are. Okay. So it's a strong statement you're making. I mean, we I think we only agreement they don't support it. Good luck having them take it out of their switches then host be able to use it or No no. I mean, we we already have the target the best of Ig p three and Ml two the best of those is going to be full Internet standard. That what we're trying to do. Right. That's why I'm not worried what you're proposing. I'm worried about. What should be removed from the past. And it sounds like there's an effort starting to tell vendors that Igm p version one is going to be obsolete? That you should take it out of your product. Yeah. Yeah. Is that what you're trying to do? And Igm pv two, I'm... I'm not quite sure. I it's certainly not going to be full standard like Ig p three. Right? So a little of thought. So I was in the impression and I may be wrong that the Ig bi thirty three whatever. Didn't take a Gm one out. But I may be wrong. Because, yeah. That's a significant change. But Yeah. Whatever? No. I think what we wanna say is is this eight hundred has been a very bad. Experience. Because of the normal language. Because it has no language.

I'm very sure that there is no anywhere clothes or similar contentious text in eleven twelve. Right, It's the Ip multi cost host stack, the mapping to Ethernet, Right? So it's all stuff.

So I wonder what it means to say, do not support Ig v one anymore. All Igm p one is two messages the query and the report. Note that report that data point is used in Igm and p two. So you have to be careful how you message this. No. I mean, it's it's it's not that difficult. Right? What what happen is simply, that but a vendor a vendor is gonna say if I don't need to support Igm p one, that means I'm not gonna listen to those reports anymore. Just gonna listen to the Ig and p v three. Well, I mean, I'm just saying you need to be very careful it's says is is...

First all, we have three dimensions to consider to scale number of receivers, a number of flows and size of the network. So for each of these the dimensions, is a solution. So in terms of number of receivers, the module cost can scale through unlimited number of receivers. As long as you grow the tree, you can you can scale. The number of flows the solution is used tunnels. So wherever you can you tunnel my multiple trees then there is no need to my momentum stage. Then the size of them network you can... That the timeline can happen in different part of the network using different types or different instance of that tunnels Next slide, please? Not a question or no. Hi. This is Just from Huawei. Actually, it's glad to find that these three the scaling dimensions you have mentioned because we have almost the same considerations in our problem statement document of Msr six, if you have noticed So also, in our document there will be the use cases why we these two three points and the four use cases one of the scaling problem may be more severe than others. So it will be appreciated the orders of this document to review our document, and it will be great if we can work together on this Thank you. Oh, okay. I I... To be honest, I didn't notice that that I will read re read that and then... Yeah. Sure Our. Thank you. Thanks. So in terms of tunnel technologies I listed all the speech here."

So to do tunnel, we need over overlay signaling so that the tunnel ingress can know which flows to prove tunnels In some cases, the timing also need to know with what are leaves that should be on on on the tunnel next slide, please. So for overlay signaling, you could be using Mod or team or or Ml or as the already signaling product call. The say... Which is the same as the the protocol for the ton traffic. The examples are we have Ml signaling for Mod traffic over other panels. This includes or Mod over targeted sessions And then That's for mod over or r p P p or p one b tunnels. And then you could have Mod over beer there is a beer working group grabbed on that. And then for P as signaling, that is for Ip or over other tunnels. The exam was P over which is rosa making or refer to also, you can call the P. Line is p over Beer ton. There's another b one group track on finally, can even use Igm or Ml for Ip traffic over year.

And finally, when you have a large network and your net your panels need to be segmented, meaning using in different types or different instances of the same type in different regions. Now When you have a ton of segmentation, those Routers are sitting at the borders of the different regions we call those segmentation points. Those segmentation points need to maintain overlay stage in particular the the p zeroes routes. Next slide, please. So now the question is those sigma segment segmentation points. How do you scale those segmentation points because they need to maintain over the states. You can scale them up. Or you can scale them out. One, point I one emphasize here is the about scale up. The multiple forwarding states is actually not much different from Uni fourteen states. Basically recycle, you have routes pointing to some info forty instructions. In the uni case, the forty instructions could be forward traffic out of some Sm branches, for example, ten branches. In the multi case, it's not using branches it's replication branches. So that's the only difference. The the amount of information is about the same. Now if you can scale up in, then you can scale scale up Class. No problem. It just that the implementation better"

That's basically a summary. Different scanning dimensions. Different solutions. It's all mature technologies we can put together to to make a scale. Okay That's it. Yeah. One more common for the previous slide previous. Thank you. I think I I have rushed through the document. I I notice that Rb is treated as b t and in the be architecture. I think it is not... It it is still on the under discussion in we working group whether rb can be down based on the existing bureau architecture So I think maybe we can have more discussions on this point Right.
