And then we have the next second document deduction came back from the Isp the main take away why this came back is because we we are supposed to standard as a protocol, not to just publish use cases. So because the next gonna draft doesn't really change the protocol in any way, but is just a clever use of it this came back. So we will work it out between the the actual content and maybe the the rules see what we can do with this. Okay. And anyway, we have a presentation"

Hi, Dino. And gonna present an update on the satellite draft. C authors are Victor in C? Next slide? So just to do an overview, gave you gave this overview in London as well as last year. Basically, the high level goals for this draft is to show you that a lisp overlay can run over a satellite network as well as it can run over in the Ip packet delivery. Under lay. So we're just gonna use the satellite network as an under underway It's a satellite network can deliver Ip packets, then we can run a list overlay over it.

Wherever you see red there, we're referring to rat outlook addresses that are routed by the under underway and E state is the host state or any Id state that runs on top of the overlay. So... Like any under lay there's no e state in the satellite network. Satellite network is actually unaware that list was running over it, like unaware of any specific application especially in the satellite notes. The overlay requires the delay just to deliver packets to the outlook address. So the satellite network still has to do routing and deal with all the movement that's going on. With orbits and Is and all those sorts of things. Explain that terminology again in the second. The under right under underlying network can transmit Ip Ip v and ip six So you have the option of using whatever you want in the under lay, of course. So if you just wanted to build an Ip six network overlay and run it on an Ip v four underway, like what Star will implements today, you could do something like that. And when path optimization maybe needed in the leg, there's talk in proposals about running a source routing or Sr v six So you can route through the satellite path. That's not clear, I know how that's gonna work then the satellites are moving very fast and The problem we have with satellite networking is Traditionally, the network networks stood still was bolted into racks and it was the host that moved around. Now we have the satellite terminal nodes that are on that are up rf links that are stationary there the whole backbone network is moving around fast. Very fast. Next.

And since they are so close to earth, they're coming and going very quickly. And so you need to deploy lots of satellites in orbit to be able to stay connected. The plan here is that, well, satellites to be able to cover the earth if I wanted to send a packet from San Francisco to London, and stay in space. So I don't have to go up down up down up down. We would need these Is satellite links to work. And rumor has it that Spacex is supposed to start supporting them in the first quarter they're building two bands of iso, one at twenty six sla to, like, fifty eight lead or something like that. And then another band down by the Caribbean covered Terry and Australia. Carrie gets good connectivity. And then list runs on the ground. So those xt t r's that we know that in caps d caps packets are going to just be called ground station Xt and all the Ids will be behind it and they can move around they can move from Wi Terrestrial to ground station Xt and you satellite connectivity. So list runs there at the... It can run anywhere at the site, but it can probably be in the Wifi Router that actually connects to the satellite network when you buy satellite kit from Spacex, they give you a dish that's about the size of a pizza box and they give you a Wifi router and the Wi Router basically sends everything straight up and you could put lisp right in the Wi Router or one hop beyond it. And we've been doing tests where we put in different places. I'll explain that in a second.

Can or should we put the mapping system in space and should we put encapsulation at the satellites and we don't see a need for that at this point in time because it's a very complex networking environment up there. So here's the draft status, we did an update in the the dash zero two. We did update now in February of this year and I basically added... We're doing some telemetry measurements of the satellite network in our testing And so I wanted to document those new use cases that we're doing So the last part of the document tells you all the combinations of tests that we're running over the satellite network. And and then the last the update the dash zero zero one was in last fall, and then we started the first draft was done in April last year. Next. Just one thing that we changed is to be able to test the telemetry Rt t's one way late, timestamps, all these sorts of things on the satellite network. The two I f actually talk directly to each other. And since the star Wifi routers are carrier grade devices not just residential net, the Category net, it makes it very difficult So we have to find a way for my house to be able to encapsulate to say Daryl house directly without having to go through an Out r because now when we do natural reversal we punch holes through the Nat. So the Rt can encapsulate packets back so that's the data path. Right? And if you do the data path and you put an Rt like an Aws or whatever, then you're seeing the latency through Aws and you're not getting any good valuable measurements. So I decided to experiment a little bit with something called what I call decentralized net, where we can actually encapsulate from one side to the other. And I...

So I can't get packets through to open up the nat to get packets back and forth. So what we decided to do was we went ahead and we still registered the global, but they're defined by the Rt echoing back in the info replies. And that's good. So we have these global outlook but the only one who can really use those global are the other tiara caps. Okay? Now some devices will keep state and it doesn't care who the source address when you encapsulate back down. So what we do is once the those both x t get global outlook state from each other, they just send these packets into never to get it through the net to create the state. And then when they started kept packets it gets through. It works on residential that's perfectly It doesn't always work in carry grade nets. And star lincoln decided to do carrie look grade nets. So we have phone calls into settling support to say we wanna figure I do this. So we don't know what to do. You have puzzled elder. Not way. Okay. So so that... So this has nothing to do with satellite, but we wanna be able to run tests to to verify these tele telemetry measurements Next. Before going to the next I have a question actually. So you have the natural solution different from the... Let's say, they drafted has been discussed in the working loop.

So if if if there's some kind of steering of the satellites, however, that's gonna be done because there's a big scale problem associated with this. The caps on the ground could use it is it gonna be useful probably not. So I think we just should launch Ip packets because it's the most robust system. And if Ip packets get lost, we know how to deal with loss packets like we do on the terrestrial network, that's the best I can say. Now we could also use list pe and do encapsulation hops But what we're doing is if I wanna jump from San Francisco to London, I can go up to a satellite, maybe over one iso to another sale I come down in use in and houston the size to go back up And so that's kind of being done today quite a bit.

So you were gonna pick up a piece of work and you had that need to have a hierarchy of security or, you know, relationships, and that this is the a protocol specification I would satisfy that.

And all the use the use cases that I cow is using for the aero article network is using E d mobility as well. So I don't think they should be merged. Your question is should they both be put on standards track I think the answer is yes. Because that's a key feature that lisp is providing to That community in general that other people have struggled with anchor points and, you know, all the stuff that's been done with mobility in the For three decades now. Predictive about looks. I don't know. I... Like, the author to comment on that.

One thing I was going to propose is maybe one other way of looking at it is that for example, some of the huge case documents are using a set of specifications in a different why or maybe ways that we weren't actually associating them before. So one way could be a deployment report of a number of things coming together that could be something that's useful at least for the group. Then just documenting the use case.
