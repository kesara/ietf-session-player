    "text": "custom data identification was also important to us and the idea that you need it in the context of a mission or an operational deployment to be able to build custom reports custom variables custom other bits of reporting rules time-based rule state-based rules and you need to be able to name those as well and those don't necessarily have to be globally unique if they exist within like a particular operator's name space and then lastly of course is the autonomous operation if we go to the next slide the the general architecture is not dramatically different to accomplish this we have agents and we have managers we rely again based on minimizing message size on pre-shared schemas the ability to communicate that during periods of configuration and our model does except for the fact that there are times when you can share and you do have end to end connectivity even if it's in a dtn and it's not contiguous that eventually you can get a message from one side of the network to the other that you can use that for configuration as long as that configuration can then include the the behaviors that need to be autonomously managed until the next time you get an opportunity for more configuration coming back next slide and then sort of lastly in some of the initial prototyping work that we had done the application data model to this autonomy model is something that we model in json we have also modeled to the extent that yang at the time could support some of the expressions that we needed we also managed or modeled these in json and then if we go one more slide this becomes the autonomy model again that that we model uh in json and in cbor on the wire and or past that is just sort of an example of what that encoding might look like uh in in json for the bundle protocol"

    "text": "and it it sort of speaks to if we go one more slide yes if the the reason i like to bring this kind of encoding up and then i will pause here is that we also uh try to build our model around things that would prevent us from having to do back and forth exchanges between really a local agent and a remote manager but also even a local agent and a local manager and the idea behind this uh is is in the the second uh named item here bundles by priority where we have a piece of externally defined data an unsigned integer that stands for bundles by priority but this unsigned integer data value can take a parameter and the parameter is a mask of the kind of information that you would like and so this idea there's some syntactic sugar built into our model to allow us to do associative lookups almost like function calls with the with generation of even simple data types to avoid having to say things like what kind of information do you have or how would you map that information and then once we get it back then making a second call to down select within that set of information so just in general that's a little bit of a history of the ama it's being picked up and rebranded as delay tolerant network management it does still have an aspirational piece which is the problem we're trying to solve it has a data modeling piece it has a set of encodings content encoding separate from will will eventually also be transport encodings and the model has focused on trying to enable very deterministic autonomy without requiring building scripting languages and mobile code because sometimes there are obviously security issues around deploying that particularly in resource constraint systems that you don't check up on quite so often so if anyone is more interested in the details of this work i would be happy to answer questions here or talk to people offline as we go thank you very much"

    "text": "people need to know that uh i only asked to do this a couple of days ago and he stepped up and agreed to do it so a big thank you and i think that this is this could be relevant uh to uh to manage also because with our protocols we try to keep the network connected but some somehow the laws of physics get in the way sometimes and if the distance is too great for your radio range or or there are obstacles or or there's jamming or whatever then yeah you were your mayonnaise may easily break into two or more pieces and i think that then this asynchronous management approach can help to have these these uh fragments of the uh of the network uh sort of manage themselves uh with some uh some uh guidance that has been uh preloaded into them and they can phone home so to speak as soon as they can um but i would like to hear from from other uh participants in this session if they have any comments or ideas we have just a couple of minutes left not all at once please well i i was thinking that do you think this uh this applies back to non-delay networks too like is there benefits that you know looking at something in the extreme but then say taking it back to regular networks is there something you see that you could also use"

    "text": "absolutely so the the and a lot of some of the additional asynchronous behavior that we're seeing coming out of ops area is the observation that just sending everything back to a common central management place is is difficult and generates way too much traffic um in well-resourced networks because of course the data is scaling the next part of that is if you're able to filter what you choose to push then you can also start tolerating operating in different transport environments and so all the way down to microscale we have microprocessors that would say instead of using something like our map uh there are times when our processor is just literally turned off uh and another say a managing processor is turned off and then turns back on again and wouldn't it be nice to be able to have these communications and you know that's all on a single embedded platform so we're not quite talking about delays and disruptions in that particular way but the other is if you want a synchronous behavior without requiring tls sessions for example this is a good way of saying that if my if my two nodes are otherwise resourced but they are they are turned off and they when they when they come up they do have good um ability to communicate with one another the real uh benefit here is to be able to quickly synchronize on what autonomous actions did you take when i disconnected from you or when i didn't have a session with you and if you were able to have that behavior you can then start building in the fact that you don't need the infrastructure and the cost and the expense to always maintain those sessions or re-establish those sessions and and so the amount of time that your remote partner actually have to be online can be reduced even if otherwise you could choose the expense to always have it online and we think that there are cost savings there without sacrificing the responsiveness of the managed device thank you and"
