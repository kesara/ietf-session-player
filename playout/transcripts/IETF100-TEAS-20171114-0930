    "text": "proper regenerators all the network and basically compute service function chains in such a way that you can minimize for example how many rich aerators you need for a critical service function in order that the signal on receivers will be optically reachable next so and of course you can example entire data centers as a single road and beautiful it\u0027s computer storage resources a service function and create again service fashion chain which go across the network and between data centers and can still satisfy your delay constraints for example that\u0027s fine okay so the next person we want to solicit more feedbacks from working group I have some discussion part of those discussions we are not on that of the list so we would like to have some discussion on the leave list and identify more use cases if if it\u0027s possible and also we want to relate this work to the network slicin because we believe this this could be a very good basis for metal slicing I mean the software functional were at the board that\u0027s it this is true from probably a clarification question is this Dandy\u0027s model be useful if I\u0027m using the excellent tunnel and that\u0027s where if that\u0027s my common case that I am using SFC and underlying I\u0027m using VX lon goodbye model mysterioso because there are some things in this model which are very which I find very interesting and are useful so is it only when underlay is de tunnel that\u0027s where this comes in or if can I reuse yeah well this is Teton House but basically we do not want to focus to narrow down for the traffic engineering tunnel it could be any other tunnels that interconnects service functions well but but the point is that if if you have just reachability tunnels then it\u0027s not really important where the service functions are on the topology right so that\u0027s why we see that it\u0027s more important when you have when you pin it to the TT topology and then you can do this communication I was talking about no I actually I feel like even though if you don\u0027t use to eternal since when we are computing the SF path itself and if I have a choice between the same service function being available at multiple places even though the reach ability is the same just looking at those properties I can make good decisions on which service functions I should choose "

    "text": "during the service boy yeah I agree but it\u0027s very interesting okay so this is another presentation basically me interfere wash offending me I should say took the first step on the young model that would take care of a software function or idea topology so as I mentioned in the previous slide we want to view a service functions as elements of that of the node right so so those are guys you see this red guy so there are some service functions and we want to define them as a big boxes which could be identified by a global unique IDs and we don\u0027t want to actually define sort of function per se we want to reuse it see definitions so that US client interested client can use this service function IDs and get the details of the service functions that open network and for example understand to what extent they are mutually substitutable right but over on the node you have service functions which have also connection points and for this connection points they could be connected with each other in in a local service function chains they could be also connected to their what we call LTPS right lean termination points and thus to be connected to the service functions which recite on the neighboring nodes and also could be connected to the TTP\u0027s and thus could be connected to two service function residing on any node on the topology next line right this is what I just described so we how we define so responds how we want to reuse Tosca on data stores before hunted NC stuff again that\u0027s like right so one of the interesting and important concept of the key topology is connectivity matrix matrix right and this connectivity matters can describe their switching capabilities or limitations of of a node basically how the link termination codes could be interconnected across a load and at what cost so this model basically capitalizes or leverages this concept and defines three new connectivity metrics one of the "

    "text": "first one is so responsive to service Frandsen which describes how how the service function and which of them could be locally interconnected and the course and then source function to LTP and so response on to TTP right so basically this is the connectivity matrix which describe which source function could be connected to which nodes LTP and nodes gtps respectively so at the end of the day you have full picture which functions could be connected to each other on the node which functions could be connected to neighbors and which ones that could be connected across the moral our next time across the topology so one thing what we are trying to also try to preserve the concept of virtual link it\u0027s a virtual link and this is called concept we want to use when they\u0027re connectivity between service functions on a node negligible in terms of course penalties compared to the end-to-end service function changed so for example if you do not want to deal with the course connections or a sponsor to each other you might use our challenge the describe that this function could be just connected and that\u0027s it right so and then those little service function change could be combined in a bigger service function that\u0027s right so and this is what you can get using this model the client can get a for example or mdac in terms of a CTN terminology can get from a domain a topology which has basically the political information right and also sort of functions which are sitting on all the nodes and this is what you can do and achieve for example a CTN goals like service function mobility that Daniela was talking about next that\u0027s why yeah and this is a look in the previous presentation you could complete various surahs function change change using this models next slide "
