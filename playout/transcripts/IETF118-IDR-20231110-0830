We'll we'll have you good going in just a second. So good morning, everybody. Welcome to Welcome to the, 2nd session of IDR for IETF 118. So we have a, light agenda today. We actually should have a little bit of room the end. So we're not gonna be pushing for promptness quite as much. And we do actually see some of the presentations have, you know, some potential for discussion. So we definitely invite that to happen, during the session. Watching the clock and trying to make sure that we're fair to everybody. Next slide, please. So this is your, reminder every meeting that we are covered by the IATF note well. You are expected to read and abide by this. Next slide. Get it. So if you have that done so, please use 1 of the QR codes either outside the room. At the microphone or we'll start passing this around so that you can sign in This ensures that we actually get ourselves a, a meeting of appropriate size get him. Shifts, Sorry?

So we're gonna load those slides next. Hi, everyone. This is Kali Raj. I'm gonna talk about BGP Multi Netstop Attribute present it again and, the changes that has happened, from, AT117. Next slide, please. So we'll just have a recap of the background on the problem statement. And, bird's eye view of the multi next stop attribute. Go over some changes, since IDR 117 And we have, so during these changes and some more King, So I'm rethinking whether capability negotiation that was added is, required. We'll discuss about that and we added a few use cases. So we'll just, go in a little bit of deep dive on the 4 p or 6 p use case, in this session. Next slide, please.

It, is being thought we have been talking about. Next slide, please. So, basically, the problems in the way we have is we are enabled to advertise more than one next stops, not easily extensible to newer endpoint. I and encapsulation types. And Adpath Adpath is the only way we have to less, more, than one next ops for a route. And, it is unable to express the relationship between the next and also it's like, scaling heavy. And enable you to signal the NCAP information uniformly across the families. For example, cannot signal labels for SafiOne routes. And this is what we'll touch touch on, with the 4 PEO 6 P use case. Yeah. Next slide, please. So this is just a bird's eye view of a multinixlab attribute. So where, the main, building block is affording instruction. Which has a forwarding action and set of forwarding arguments. And, the MNS attribute basically has a primary path which which contains 1 or more forwarding instructions. It can contain a backup path which has the same set of forwarding instructions. And then label descriptor can be used to describe labels advertising about where the basically, it's just giving information about what the label means at the advertising note. Next slide, please.

Which were basically, talking about how do we signal, intent over pec attachments circuit, that's, for example, enabling, DHCP signaling in the BGP routes using their managed attribute. So it's just telling to the, CE router on a Safeway 1 route. That that you can use a DSCB code to to send traffic and, exercise a certain color colored path or single m MPLS labels so that in the data traffic, the CD can, send the data traffic with the label. That label is exercising a particular transport class path. So these are the use cases that moved from that managed draft. And then we added a new illustration new use case. That's the 4pe, use case, which we'll talk about in in this session. Next, please. This is the question about whether the capabilities really needed. So initially, this, attribute was an optional transitive attribute. That is when this concern was raised and we added the capability well as we made the attribute as up in a non transitive So being an often nontransitive attribute, that stops the propagation as an unrecognized attribute, through speakers that don't understand it. And if we had an outside rule, if we add a receive side rule to stop the unintended propagation process supported node, then we may not need the capability. So the problem with having a capability negotiated open capability is that whenever there's a conflict change, it'll cause a certain bones. So I am thinking that that may be, troublesome for, operations. So I'm thinking of adding this text where we say that"

I just want to bring this up, in this session so we can discuss it on the list. Make the changes as we go forward. Next slide, please. Yeah. So this is the main thing that we I wanted to talk about in the session. So here, we just have a 4 p or a 6 p use case. Where we typically want to signal a MPLS label. Is like a mostly express and all. Safi 1 drops. So here, I've just taken an example of a option c network. Which has multiple domains, And it's a mix of domains in the sense that their heterogeneous in the sense that some of them are ipv4 course and some of them are ipv6 So here, the domain 1 and domain 3 are English domains. Our domain 1 is ipv4core and domain 3 is a IPV 6 Golf. And domain 2 and domain 4 or English domains where, domain 1 is ipv4. And domain for its operating score. So and the ipv4 unicast and ipv6 unicast routes are received. At domain 1 and domain 3. And, how do we provide, reachability or forwarding for these, at his families, when we have a mix of these kind of domains. So what is required is, the basically, the problem is that the p routers. Let's say p 11inipv4core. They may not be V Six capable. That was the problem with 6p. Right? And so if we don't get an expiration. Now"

It's able to forward it properly. But because we needed to advertise explicit null, 6p we advertise the V Six Unica's routes into V6LU. And that used to that worked fine with an internal main case, but If we go into domain, then we need to think further. And because IPV is unique, IPV is labeled was not you at that point for anything else in the transport. So we were able to do that. If we come to the ipv6 course, that's a user's domain 3. So in this case, V4 unicast has this problem. Basically, when the V 4 unit cost comes, how do we advertise it out? And, so what is required is, we need to be able to advertise a label for the V Four unicast out. So on the right, we have these, approaches shown that 2 approaches that's possible. One is, like, you keep the address family consistent. For ipv6 service route, we advertise it consistently in is heavy one one. And for ipv6 service out, we advertise it in at this family, 21. And wherever we need to analyze the label, that additionally with the Aviso fee 11 or 21 route. I would MNH with an explicit label. Or a real label, whichever is required. And the transport layer remains, savvy for with 1 or 2. After you went out So this has a consistent, at his family at each layer. Across all the domains, which makes management easy in my opinion. There is no cross family redistribution. But if we contrast this with an approach which overload Safi 4 to carry the service routes. We see that, the service out that are received in ipv4"

Domain 2 domains for will need to be translated to Safi 4. And, similarly, ipv6 service needs to be translated between Safi 24, FISAVi 24 andafiqi 2 And at the transport, we already have before labor being used as a transport family in one of these groups. Essentially, what we are seeing is there's, like, the red receivers happening between the V Four service, families, 1114. And, 2421. And also because the safi 4 families are already carrying transport routes. So there's, like, automatically the service coming into the transport family. So there's, like, redistribution match between all the families. And we need to be able to do some additional checks based on communities or other things. And these kind of things looks very risky to me. And, so so we we've just contrasting the 2 approaches and, recommending and testing that we go with an approach which keeps, at a family consistent across all the domains. So that it's easier for managing in future. Next slide, please. So this just shows, the layout of the M and A attribute, how will it look like for the 4 p case when it's an ipv6 score. Sorry. This is actually in ipv4. Basically, when it is an ipv4core, we will have a next stop, which is like a IPV format basics address, and the label will be the explicit Next slide, please.

This is just Am I hearable, Jeff? We can hear you. Okay. This is to announce we will start working group adoption call for this, this next week, probably today. So please make sure to ask questions of Calibraj so that you can discuss the adoption on the list. Thank you. Thank you, Sue. 2nd. Hello. Satya from Cisco Systems. So I had 2 observations regarding this. I think the capability negotiation probably is not needed. I think it limits the deployment of this. And secondly, this attribute is defined as, a non transitive whereas you know, the router capability. The next of capability drafted is optional transit. So I think it's a little bit diverging. So I would request, like, the working group to cover these points. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Satya. So, basically, that's in line with the, I mean, the point about, capability negotiation that's in line with my understanding. But the non transitive thing, I think it's good to have non transitive though it has the number something about, having the error updated. But I think once auto is upgraded, that problem is solved.

And I have the queue now, and, One of my comments, Kyle Raj is, echoing Satias. We're looking at, getting some analysis by the working group on this proposal with a few friends. One of them is no scoping, which is partially about the optional, nontransitivity in this case. You know, Satya makes the point that We have a new mechanism for the next top capability that provides a different flavor of this So the working group should take a look at, know, how we want to actually encapsulate this a second piece is, you know, attribute escape, which has become dear and dear to my heart at least, making sure that we don't act definitely have this get somewhere else get bound to the inappropriate routes and do the wrong thing. And the third thing that is necessary to take a look is, consistent incremental deployment. One of the things that I have, some concern on in the proposal, and I'd like to have the working group know, give their scrutiny to it is how the multi next hop attribute behaves on a hop by hop basis. You know, you know, picking an easy example, if you have, you know, 3 gateways as part of the route, what happens when one of the legs is on resolvable at one specific leg Does it get stripped off before being passed? Does it, just simply become unresolvable there and maybe become resolvable at the second half. know, etcetera. So I I I'm not saying You There needs to be any specific discussion or answers at this moment. But this is a review we're looking for as part of the adoption process. Sure. To quickly answer that, so, basically, the attribute is expected to be, consumed at a receiver. And if it is a next stop selfie advertisement, then that review is not carried forward. But a new attribute can be attached by the advertiser."

Carrie has next set of comments. Hey, Kali Raj. I was just going to say that, more than non transitive, you're looking for the behavior you described at the EGP boundary, you wanna be able to filter it. If you if the next stop is if the others do next stop and change, which is usually the case, then you want to forward it as long as the other end understands it. So I'd suggest if, my preference would be that you really consider it as an optional transitive and then put the filtering rules in place exactly like how the the next hop entropy label draft has sort of solved it along the lines. That was the first comment the second comment that I had was and I haven't looked at the draft, the recent version. So please bear me, but now there are multiple ways to signal labels. And you I'm hoping you have some text that talks about the consistency between prefixID, BGPLU, where you carry the labels inside Perfect. And now with M M And H. Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. So Yeah. I can, Add some text with respect to prefix it. So so what is there today is like, the comparison between how it interacts with the label in the 8277 and but how it, compares with prefix here. I can add add that. Yeah. And my suspicion is that you want to give the labels that are carried in M And H more preference than prefix said. So you may want to add some text that says, hey, the priority is in the following order in case you see the labels that have been carried across 3 different ways. And by the way, the labels are different just in case"

Our next presentation is gonna be advertising SaaS performance, Beths, Patricks, using BGP Hey. Hello, everyone. My name is Hong, from Huawei.

Basically, it's an ipsec over a 3 the impasse. And, BGP is used as a control plan to to advertise the, the IP circuit attribute and the, port attributes. To to recharge them. So they can establish the IP server terminal And for the enterprise, they are using more and more, SaaSaaS application. For example, the office 365 or or drop offs or or salesforce. And those SaaS application are already deployed in the cloud for the better capability. Deployed in the cloud means that they can be a access from multiple sites. For example, in the in the branch, it can be directly in in the branch or or through the SE 1 terminal, go to the headquarter and headquarter assess SaaS application. So which means, in, in in the right figure, you can see that there are multiple choice,"

Or go through the CPU 2 and the code, go through the NPS network and assess the cloud or go through CPC3. Go to another internet person and assess such application. The problem is which path is the best for this application? To do that, we need to collect the past performance metric. Of the of each pass, and, it's needed to be advertised to other CP. So the other CP, you can combine the pass metric. And generated this kind of a table for each application, of the each each pass. First, you this figure as an example, the CPU 3 can measure the past 3 dash 1, on past 4 dash 1 performance. And pass this result to the CPE 1. So CPE 1 combine them with the, past performance of the SE 1 terminal, you can general references table. To pick the best pass for this application. So to do that, we need that you, pass the, at, at, at, otherwise, the SaaS performance metric, the key of the, sales performance metric will be the the past performance metric for specific past QOS specific SES application. So the key, we are content is 2 parts. The first part to identify the pass.

So it was on either SD WAN node IT And then the other party is about to identify the app. Application. We designed to few two fields. The first field is a application ID. The ID is used because the IP of the SaaS application may vary between the different sites. So we need a separate ID to identify that. And we all for the same app, they may have a different requirement for the pass. Chances are just the design scenarios. And we design a new type of BGPSC 1. And I, it's a new root type. The encoding is showing the right the speaker. You lost focus. Yeah. So for the past performance metric, is kind of the key value, the value part. The metric will include the past measurement result, for example, the typical US, Deep DNA, NOS jitter bandwidth. And the the past QS will be aggregated bay based on these above factors. And then we'll also include the SaaS application name or SaaS application my name. For this metric, we have 2 options of encapsulation. The first one will be the metadata pass attribute. Defined in this, edge service and metadata. And the, the second one is that no encapsulation. I think we prefer the first one because it's kind of related to the to the canola side, to pass to the canola side. Not the SD WAN terminal, terminal performance."

We use an application ID because, IP address and domain name cannot uniquely identify, SaaS application. The IP of a SAS application varied based on the patient when they deployed it in the cloud.

So it cannot identify the one specific subset. But the the SaaS application name and domain name is 0 Yoodful.

The application will be identified in the in the CPE using various technology, and, you can ask the controller to assign our application ID or it can be a global registry for the different application. But I think global ready to train may be really hard that you can get standardized. So that's all I want to present and we will know if you're sick, free to bear kind of comments. For example, do you have any thoughts on the application ID and, what kind of pass metric is useful and how to combine different the pass metric And for the encapsulation, do we use embedded data pass attribute or internal attribute incrust here will come this out welcome 6, First question, Nakamana, Man Kamala Mishra, Cisco Systems.

And this is the point that was just made by. We we have a set of potentially very dynamic information getting ready to be injected in the BGP. And we know that that can be very problematic based on Beach conversions properties. So That is certainly gonna be one point of analysis that working groups could be to work through for every one of these proposals, you know, how much dynamic information is in there, how does the protocol react for it for its deployment scenario? And, you know, also just questions about how many path attributes we end up burning for these applications. You know, right now we're at the beginning, we have a very small number of them. You know, we have basically I'm gonna say about 5 different proposals out of the table, 3 of them being presented today. And if we end up rapidly burning through things, we don't have an infinite number these things and may wanna look at making a much more generic mechanism, perhaps this overlaps with the cats work after all. Maybe that, is where we eventually take the work as a piece of generic passing compute metrics, no via BGP. For past selection purposes. So this is That's specifically a comment to you, although it's sort of a warning. This is how we will be analyzing Gerber.

Because when you, as you just self said, is it's end to end. There is information in there and I will also say that from an operator perspective, I'm getting a little bit worried about all of the things we are trying to dump into BGP and making it more and more complex and That can create operational headaches for operators when things go wrong because the more that you dump into BGP. The more chances are something goes wrong. So this I have concerns about continuing to dump things that have the intended for into PGP. But also, yeah, I really think that you need to socialize this in cats and then that discussion can happen as to where this belongs once they've seen it and, you know, we've seen it and figure out where it belongs.

Okay. Here is the propose the problem scenario. We can see this. This is a hierarchy in this network, and there are with rteone. Can be from the PUL or PE3 or P4. And with art constrained, these RTC routes will need to be firstly advertised between this piece and going to the art different hierarchy. With the current rules, when this, RTC raw information around re eridges, r 1 in a higher level it will be one of them will be selected at the past R. D. C. Ralphs and it will be advertiser. To the both of these, clients in this case, if this, routes from the R2 is selected, it will we advertise back to the R2 what is this cluster ID, of the post the class 1 and the class 2 carried in the class list.

First one is proposed to use add pass for the RTC routes between the hierarchical r's that's it. Can you ensure that, on different hours. They can always gather the if sufficient analysis routes, which can pass this BGP loop detection, and this advantage of this mechanism, there's no change to the BGP parts a lot of room. And Another option is to, to in because this is caused by are in the lower level receiver RTC routes. Advertised by itself. So maybe another option is the to ask the higher level are to advertise a most destroyed alternative route to the peer from which the best route is received. This, my in this, drafted, most of this drawing, the alternative pass is can have the different in the cluster list and originate our originator ID attributes from the those are the best routes.

So this is the brief, recap of this draft, the the next steps, we think, we can continue the discussion with both the authors of other drafts and the booking group.

And then decision on what parts to be advertised also increases the button. Right? And the second one is actually how disjoint the parts are from the best path, and those need to be sent to the lower level r hours, right, So that is kind of breaking the BGP update backing So that's an an optimal thing. So when we looked at this problem, we thought how to simplify this. So in line with what Krishna commented, what we are doing apart from the originate overwriting the originator and the stock stock, stock, stock, stock We actually want to override the cluster list. But we simply cannot, like, override the last prepended cluster ID, we will have to override the whole thing. And I will I'll explain what that is. And this rule is when we are reflecting a client to another client. We won't do anything except prepending. When we are reflecting from non client to client or client to non client. Okay? So let's say there is an active constraint route or the RT 1, which P3 is advertising to rr5. Rr5 will add its cluster, let's say, like, C3 cluster ID. And then rr5 will send to rr3.rr3 will do the same because it's coming. So the sorry. One thing I should have said is other one is the highermost error in the hierarchy. Rr 2 and other 3 are the clients of other 1 and other 4 and other 5 are the clients RR 2 and RR 3 and so forth and so on. So then we were at RR3. RR3 will send to RR1. We will just apparentc2.

And the way we have done this, we came across some interesting issues. I don't know if others are aware, but instead of overwriting the next hop. We can potentially just ignore the next Okay. So we will not take the next hop. Into consideration. Right? Because that metric can cause problems. I will this one. Advancing It should Yeah. So before that, I want to actually go back So here, see, this is an interesting issue. Suppose So because of the okay. At our focus is at rrone. Right?

Now at rr2, I sent to rr1 and rr1 advertised it as best because it can my update is best. I'm at I'm at rr2. So at rr2, The next hop of that route is rr1, right, that path. And let's say the IGP metrics at 2 for error 1 is better than the IGP metric for p 1. So there is some little bit of instability. See that? So when we ignore this next stop thing, next stop, we ignore the next stop. Then we don't we it will be the best part selection and propagation of RTC routes will be more stable. I uploaded the new version today. It's it's it's it's probably explains better there than what I'm explaining. And, but I think people who are initiated and this will get it quick. Right? And The second solution, I think, is a very direct solution, and this seems to be very foolproof. So what we do is when the 2nd level error Season updates. With its own cluster ID, just treat it as a received only route. Do not make it eligible for best path or advertise it anywhere. As a all we really want is a connected graph, right, if you see? It doesn't have your directed acyclic graph. It should be just some kind of loop free. It's a, like, a complete thing. And this just solves the purpose. So we have given both proposals.

So the like, the point I was making, I didn't include it here is Suppose there is only one VPN. Right? And that VPN It sends the route target and no one else is interested in that.

But, I'd say 2 more comments to, to what you said. Number 1, Whatever you do, no export, is something you should consider because what you've explained is a topology, on a higher hierarchy that is a multilevel And if your Lowest level connects to the highest level directly and creates a circular dependency you really want to break that. And one solid way to break that is just say don't announce anything I've received so far and then reoriginate whatever you want to reoriginate or rewrite whatever you want to rewrite.

When we're doing these types of overrides, we do have potential no export considerations because These routes are also used for inter domain purposes. So if you start breaking which route you should select for inter domain advertisement, we have potential problems to worry about there. So we look at these solutions, we have to look at the inter domain case as well. So thanks, and I just wanted to acknowledge that I did had a hallway conversation with Jeff about put us back on this. Yeah. John, you're next. John Scudder. I was gonna apologize for not having carefully reviewed the draft, but then he reminded me was just published. So don't feel so bad.

Scares the living daylights out of me. Because you are going in and meddling with a fundamental correctness mechanism of the protocol. Play like saying, oh, yeah, this AS path thing, you know, we gotta constraint apologies so the hell of And I think that's, Probably just a very bad idea.

And something more persuasive than we're only going to deploy this in a constrained On the other hand, your solution 2, where you said if I understand it right, you know,"

This method refers to distance from ingressp to ingressp's in IPV's own networks for IPV for service delivery.

And I think as Keith had mentioned, I guess, about the the previous, presentation related to format 6 and encapsulation. So this is kind of a typical encapsulation style solution very very basic, very simple, but what we're doing is we're doing exactly the same thing that you that existed with you know, being able to carry, p 4 connecting 6 IOs of our 4 core, with RFC 4798. A standard for that never really didn't exist does not exist for connecting V Four islands over a V64 network. And so that's really the motivation, the main motivation from this Doctor. So this draft provides an informational document related to, providing that standard solution. Next slide. Just a recap on 4pe. As I said, it is it is a it's a encapsulation based solution. So, basically, it's a simple debit your transport label, you know, encapsulation that you're carrying You have a a ipv6 LSP across your core. Single protocol, for and that you're basically tunneling your these v 4 prefixes over that V6 LSP And so those before prefixes, they they could be either labeled or not labeled in, 6p the standard was for labeling the, b4b6 prefixes. And I think that in this draft, really, the main reason why that change and shift, I guess, to not label is I the the goal for PE is being able to carry a public routing cable and a large number before prefixes. And there's really no need to label the V Four prefixes So this draft does provide that, flexibility that, you know, either. You can't label it, but you don't. You you are limited"

Provides a lot more flexibility than it's further be, as I mentioned, And then this also supports in various options a, b, c, a, b, And and as well supports, data plans and PLF as well as segment routing, SR PLS and SRV 6 data Next slide. So just a quick update on the track. So we changed the draft from standards track to informational. And then we also, made the InReus AB of change it from normative to informative since it was not a it's a It's a, individual draft And then there was a change in the s r policy draft that was it into 2 different draft, the sec types extension, So we updated that. And then, We added some use case details into the draft related to the different top label tech can be used up, from from from the mailing list, of feedback from the working group, use of an arbitrary label, implicit null label, or explicit notes of flexibility on which can be used. As well as I would say that in in the 3 main, solutions of of whether, you know, to label the v 4 prefixes are not labeling So 6p, going down the line of 6p, would would would and and that are the RFC with label all the v 4 prefixes. So that is an option with with 4 p that you can label bb4 prefixes. But that is not as scalable.

As we pulled, various vendors, maybe there are more implementations due to the way RFC 7311 has been described there are different implementations. Listed some of them here as I pulled. Some vendors propagate AGB TLV and drop, unrecognized to TLB So which means this will be an issue if we have to support any new deal, we like the general liquidity symmetric some vendors update HPTV with the metric that is different from default, IGB metrics.

We we continue to because EIGP is a optional non transitive attribute. We will have to if we have to refer to the continuity bit in that, and then make a deterministic behavior then the expectation is all the routers along the path. That more with the next stop have to have to be upgraded with the new, support.

If we do not want to go down this path and maybe limit the generic metric deal. We separately, then, option 2, which is not presented the draft. I did not talk about this. I'm just bringing it up to see what work things about it.

And therefore, there is a the it's easier to go and identify that factor and then and and have that upgraded.

I'm, one of the Morning, engineers in Bloomberg. Based out of New York, very happy to represent my apple, call it this year. To discuss the vendor implementation of the BFT strict not draft. This is a quick, overview of the short presentation that I'm presenting today. I'm gonna go through the default BFT implementation as, exist today on all the VIN this and then highlights one of the issues it has, that we have experience in our network.

I should also stress that a third vendor is gonna be supporting this feature soon. In the next month or so. And then I'll conclude by providing a summary. So the the, default BGP implementation today is kind of, undesirable in that the actual product called BGP is established before PFD's product, there is a little gap in, when PGPs up to before PFP is available. To do fast family detection, and this, get depends on the, what's running on the routers. On some of the BC routers, it could take more than 10 seconds before DFD comes up. So if you have a break in the middle problem, which we've seen quite a lot in metro e type network where the interface stays you have to rely on something like, BFP to detect it, but if BFT is not up, then, basically, you have to rely on the actual protocol whole time to detect the failure, which is quite lengthy. So it depends on the vendors. The default time is know, 90 seconds on Juniper and 80 second on Cisco. So this is, example taken from the production routers in our network obviously, I've changed the, It addresses, yeah, not just for illustration purposes. It's one of the BC Rouvers. We have learning full internet We have about 917,000 rats being learned. The messages that's shown here, it's quite typical when you have BFT detecting, a failing, So you see time out. And then it brings down BGP, which is what we want. PFP to do the next set of messages show"

So particularly when you have a flapping links, that eleven second is quite long. You could have a you know, telco issue where packets not going through. Because the interface stays up. You wouldn't have any, other mechanism to detect the failure except the protocol whole time, which is quite linked see And in most network, 90 seconds or had an 80 second, it's not an acceptable, time to detect failures. So what I'd like to do now is to go through what's propose in the BFTs strict not draft to address this issue. The the the with this with the changes in the draft, what we want to do is make sure that BFT is up before PGP. So that way, we can make sure that there is always be a to do a fast handed detection there is a capability that's, mentioned in the draft are option 74. As part of the, capability exchange, the in the BGP open messages. So if you look at how a BFT works in the default mode. You know, after the 3 way TCP hench like, the open messages are exchange. And then after that, the keep our lives are sent. And then the PGP session is established Then, currently, the BFB is then signaled to come up, which could take you know, variable time depending on what's running on the routers. And at the same time, you have the BGP updates being advertised In fact, in the small network, you could basically have all the wrap updates completed before BFP comes up. And if PFT is not up, you have a failure, a break in the middle, Then you have the, you know, the traffic black hole.

There is a slight, enhancements mentioned in the drop call, hold down. We we it doesn't talk about, you know, how the hold down is implemented. But in the case of, vendor like Juniper, for example, it's just another time that says, when BFT comes up, I don't actually want to do BGP updates immediately. Wanted to be up for a certain time. Just to make sure that the the circuit is stable. Before I start sending the Kippa Life packets and then the BGP up, that's, it's being sent at the same time. Tommy, do you want that? No. I can wait till the end. Okay. So what I would like to do now is to quickly go over very quickly the configuration to support strict not draft on Nokia and Juniper. So with the Nokia, there is a new available in 23.7 version. Called BFB Strickmate. In Juno, 23.4 is what I recommend. There is a knock called strict PFE. And as I mentioned before, tuning process support the hold down. Mechanism. This is really useful and something that we look forward to be using it on network because it helps to dampen flapping links some large networks would probably be using what interface hold time to hold up, hold down timers today to dampen flattening links. However, a lot of the link failures. We found these days. You know, does not involve interface going down you know, it's more, you know, what they call break in the middle type problem.

So you could know, when the session is established, you could actually display the capability and check that that the routers do support stigma. Both Juniper and Nokia support dynamic signaling of stigma. In the sense that both ends must support strict mode in order for the station to be treatment. Right. is something that I'd recommend. It ensures that BFP is always up before BGP route exchanges happen. This end feature is also available with other protocols and our key ten is here. There's an RFC for OSF strict log, which we have already deployed. And we're using that, with the hold down timers to help. Dampened flat in wings as well. That comes to the end of my presentation. So I'm open up for questions. Having lived this particularly entertaining health extensively a couple of years ago 2 recommendations. 1 is if there's any deviation between OSPF and PGP behavior. Right? Document extensively continues to hell out the customer. I don't think you have but just observation. Okay. Because we had an interesting implementation. We were fighting that. The second one, there is another unclear behavior, which in deployment, was causing havoc. Well, it, remote admin enable disable. Right? You can flip on the remote side, the BFT up and down. And that was sometimes during session down, sometimes not depending on implementation of different products. And that in the employment also costs very nasty surprises. It this draft may be a good place to put that in since it's basically you know, you know, you know, tries to tie down all these FSM lose FSM, you know, problem back, or maybe"

    "text": "another draft, but it's false. It's a little more more subtle version of this problem, but it was also seen in deployments. Okay. I can actually answer them. So, Tony, specifically to that point, the BFT admin downstate, which you're talking about, is explicitly called out inside of, this draft. Yeah, I just scanned through the draft. I didn't see text Yeah. The con conveniently, there's a DFT chair that watches for you. That sort of thing. Remote admin was the worst, actually, when the remote sign was admin down when you know, it's the behavior of different weather you've already done. Hey, Albert. K. Really good proposal. Quick question. Keeper lives were used from what I recall, for a really good, buffering point against colonels that could not generate Finn when a process in the user plane crashed. Typically TCP would generate a fan. Another guy would know when the ride on a socket fails, that the process is gone. And therefore, should bring the session down. If they cannot figure it out, Kipala is there, to, actually be as a buffer to say after 3 keep our lives. I don't see it. I'm gonna time out the session. So the question for you is, is there a mechanism in here because you are delaying a keep alive and right around the time where you delay the keep alive So BFP is up. But the user plane crashes and the kernel has a bug that it cannot generate a Finn, how do you go about solving that? Yeah. That would delay it all the way to 180 seconds or whatever the keep our lives there. Right? That's a good question. I think, Jeff, you wanna check Yeah. And, there is a, basically, a deadband timer that is part of the when we reach that part of the state machine for exactly that reason. We will not linger in there forever. That value can be as long as short as like, we're recommending it beyond the shorter side of things because we don't wanna keep each beef coming up for too long The drop also suggests a default time of Yeah. 30 seconds. So Nokia, if I go back to the slides,"

When you configure the advertise, could actually configure a whole time to say how long you want that, PFT to wait for the BFT to come up instead of using the whole downtime of the BGP hold time. To time out the station. Got it. Thank you. And we are out of time for the session. Thank you for presentations. Thank you for productive discussion. This is what we want to see out of IETF. Please, no continue on the mailing list. Thank you. 119. Thank you,"
