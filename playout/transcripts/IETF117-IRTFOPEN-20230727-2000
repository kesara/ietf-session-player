VBR is still under ongoing development, which is demonstrated by the release of DPR version 2, in 2019. And I learned just this week that PBR version 3 is now very much on its way. This ongoing development of BBR has partially been driven by the research community. which has contributed to the under understanding of BBR over the years in various ways. However, this previous research lead open some important questions. And these open questions have to be have to do with the approaches that were taken by this previous research. And these approaches come in 2 broad categories. The first approach in previous research are experimental evaluations, where the actual BBR implementation is tested in real physical network settings. Now to gain general insights from these experimental evaluations, either PBR implementation implementation has tested in a wide variety of network settings. And in this regard, The issue with experimental ablation is their scale dependent costs. So if the BPR implementation is to be tested in large scale networks or in high feet night fergs, these networks actually have to be physically built, which may be out of reach for most researchers. That's where our models come in. in general, control models try to mathematically describe behavior of a control algorithm, and can thus predict the algorithms performance in yet unseen network settings. However, so far, only steady state models of PBR have been proposed So models that describe the behavior of BBR in its static phase after convergence. these models do not have a notion of time and therefore cannot press transient effects, for example, such as the convergence itself."

    "text": "However, understanding this conversion is actually actually really important because the steady states in the steady state models are only relevant for performance if the algorithm can actually be shown to converge to the steady states. In our work, we try to fill these gaps in previous research with a fluid model. In contextual control research, a fluid model describes a system ordinary differential equations that it describes 2 pieces of joint dynamics. The first piece of dynamics relates to the behavior of the congestion control algorithms themselves, which run a descending note. and the differential equations thereby focus on the evolution of the sending rate over time. The second piece of dynamics in fluid models covers the response of network metrics to the sending rates chosen by the contract control algorithms. So for example, these differential equation describe the evolution of the q length over time. And with this approach based on differential equation, fluid models have a number of advantages, 1st, they enable efficient evaluation, as opposed to experiments because the differential equations in the fluid models can actually be efficiently solved for a wide range of network scenarios. To illustrate this, note that traffic flows in fluid models, our model as fluids and, therefore, do not have a notion of packets. And that means that stimulating a large traffic flows is actually not more competitionally costed and simulating a small traffic flow because this boils to just boils down to larger numbers in the same calculations. The second advantage is that fluid models, in fact, can express transient effects as opposed to steady state models and thereby allow to investigate Convergence behavior, Even more importantly, fluid models allow to rigorously prove whether an algorithm converterous, convergence,"

So in our work, We construct a fluid model that reflects DBR behavior And to make that work, we had actually had to design some new modeling techniques. I will explain that afterward. We didn't only propose the fluid model, but we also validated it with measurements from actual experiments. And in the process of this validation, could confirm previous insights into BBR performance but also generate new insights. And finally, we could also apply this stability analysis to our fluid model and thereby prove that BBR, in fact, converges, or more technically that the equilibrium of the PBR dynamics are asymptotic stable. Now we'll go through each of these contributions 1 by 1, and it will start with the design of the fluid model. Now I mentioned that we had to design some new techniques to make to reflect BBR behavior with differential equations. And to explain why that is, I will first illustrate how congestion control functional yet traditionally been represented in fluid models, and I will do so at the example of a traditional Reno algorithm. Now as we all know, at the basis of Reno, there is a quite simple troll loop. This control loop maintains a conscious window of let's say, size w here, If an acknowledgement is received, this congestion window size is increased by one segment divided by the congestion window size. this translate to to an increase by one segment over roughly 1 one round trip time, Otherwise, if a packet that occurs, the congestion window size is cut. and huff. Now this control loop is modeled as follows in the classic fluid model by Steven Low. So first, the sending rate x at any point in time is given by the congestion window size at any point in time divided by the delay"

Now it's a differential equation that why there's a dot above the variable on the left hand side, and this differential equation gives the change in the congestion window size at any point in time t. So the right hand side of this differential equation is quite complex. So let's go through one by one, The first factor in this first term here describes the share of non loss traffic. So p is a function that gives the loss rated time t, and p of t minus tau gives the loss rate 1 RT t a goal. And one minus this loss rate is the share of traffic that was not lost 1 RTT ago. multiplying this with the sending rate x of 1 RTT ago, we get the rate of incoming x acknowledgments currently. And then we multiply this with the congestion window size increase upon received act which then gives us the aggregate rate of congestion window size increase. Now turning to the second, the second term, we again have the loss rate of 1 or the tier go We multiply this with the sending rate of 1 or the tier go, and we again multiply this with the congestion window cut upon loss. And, thereby, we get the aggregate rate of congestive Windows ID decrease. Now this difference between the aggregate increase and the aggregate decrease is undoubtedly an approximation of actual renal behavior But, surprisingly, we find that this this ring of fluid model, reflects actual renal behavior quite well. especially when we couple it with our However, in summary, we see here there is a single fundamental variable, namely the congestion window size w, And this congestion window size is adapt is adapted in response to loss. And that's actually not sufficient to reflect BDR behavior."

And I will focus on how to spend with probing, and that's the sending rate of a BBR flow over So fundamentally, BBR splits time into probing periods, where each probing period consists of 8 phases, and each phase has the duration of the minimum measured RTT. So this min RTT here. Generally, in each of these eight phases, the BBR flow sends at the bottleneck the sense of the rate that corresponds to the bottleneck bandwidth estimate. denoted by p here. However, in one random phase, The rate is raised by 25 percent to discover whether more bandwidth is available. In the subsequent phase, this rate is then reduced by 25% compared to the base rate, to train any queues that may have been built up before. As this propane goes on, and the delivery rate is observed. So the rate of incoming acknowledgments and this delivery rate should roughly correspond to the ascending rate of 1 or the tier go if there is no congestion. And the maximum of this delivery rate is tenet it as the new bottleneck bandwidth estimate, denotedbypprimehere. and this probing period. probing process repeats in the next period. Now here, we already see that there is not just one single fundamental variable that is in response to loss, but that we have to model a quite different range of functionality. Specifically, we have to construct of differential equations such that we can represent these probing poses such that we can insert these probing poses into random phases such that the maximum delivery rate is tracked over time, such that the bottleneck bandwidth estimate is periodically adjusted. And on the next few slides, I will explain how we achieve this with mathematical functions. So let's start with the probing process."
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:36:04",
    "text": "In order to represent these probing poses with differential equations, we have to get inventive with mathematical functions. For our purpose, we can use the well known sigmoid function which has this formula on the left side and increases from 0 to 1 for an argument around 0. We use this sigmoid function to create a pulse function. Now for the process, remember that BPR splits time into phases where each phase has the duration of the minimum measured round trip time. denoted by tau mean here. Now let's say we want to insert a pulse into phase 1, So to do that, we take a sigmoid function that increases as the start of phase 1, we take another sigmoid function that decreases at the end of phase 1, and we multiply the sigmoid functions to get a post that covers phase one Now with such a pulse, we can augment the pacing rate of any BBR flow. To that end, we start with the bottleneck bandwidth estimate the note by XPTL here. This is this forms the base. And then we add a 25% post to it in one phase and subtract a 25% pull from it in the next face phase phase. And like this, we have represented this probing process with differential equations. Now remember that these probing poses have to be inserted into random phases. For example, if we have the pacing rate of flow i here, This This pacing rate has an upwards pulse in phase phi i, which is one here in this example, and a downward posting phase 5i+1, which is 2 in this example. So this phi i has to be determined in the fluid model in a way that captures the randomness in VBR. Unfortunately, fluid models should be fully deterministic to enable theoretical analysis, So the best we can actually do is kind of 2 achieved the goal that was intended with the randomization"

So achieve the same goal with deterministic means, And in this case, here, the goal of the decent out of the randomization was to desynchronize the probing behavior across BBR flows, and such that not all flows look for more bandwidth at the same time. And in our in the the terminals, the fluid model, we can achieve goal of this synchronization with a simple trick. So we just assign a natural number as a flow ID, atatatatatat to the competing flows, and then we'll calculate this flow ID model 07 to get the phase phi i in which flow i has the upwards pause. So if we were to simulate 10 flows, then flow 1 would have its upward post in phase 1, flow 7, would have its upwards posting phase 0 and so on. But the natural number is calculated by by is computer model of 7. although there are 8 phases in a probing period, but this is because the upwards process is actually never inserted into the last phase of a BBR probing period. This trick of desynchronization actually achieves the the synchronization as is evidenced here by the pacing rates of flow 1, flow 7 and flow 9. So the the next bit is to track the maximum delivery rate over time. To achieve this, we again rely on a sigmoid function increasing from 0 to 1 for an argument around 0 But this time, we multiply the sigmoid function by a linear function to get this function gamma here. function gamma yields 0 for an argument below 0 and yields the identity for an argument above 0. So this approximates what is commonly known as directified linear And we can use this function gamma to construct a differential equation, that"

So specifically, if we have an arbitrary evolution here in blue, this gamma will cause the current maximum to be adjusted upwards to a delivery rate. If the delivery rate is above the maximum, but will preserve the current maximum otherwise. So with this, we kind of contract this maximum delivery rate with pure differential equations, Finally, well, bear with me. This is the last slide of maths. So this this max this maximum tracking has then to be eventually adopted as the new bottleneck bandwidth estimate. And to do that, we wants more rely on the sigmoid function, and we once more create a pulse However, this time, we don't create a post that covers an entire face, but we just cover We just create a post that covers the really last few milliseconds of of the entire probing period. So here, if you have the the the second the last 4 phases of a probing period we can create a post at the period end by using a sigma function that increases shortly before the period and and another sigmoid function that decreases right at the period and and we multiply them to get pulls, and then we can use these pulls in a in an not a differential equation, that adjusts that takes basically the the maximum delivery rate that has been tracked over time. and adjust the bottleneck bandwidth estimates towards that maximum at the end of the probing period, the vendor pulls is actually non zero. So all the math I just showed you is just a very small part of our PBR fluid model, and I encourage you to read the full paper to discover how we represented the whole PBR functionality with differential equations.

So both for BBR version 1, and the version 2, and both for the drop tail and the random early drop during this And this brings me to the 2nd part of our contribution namely the experimental validation. So in this experimental validation, we validated our food model under a variety of network settings. and on a variety of configuration. So each configuration consisted of a single bottlenecktopology and the combination of control algorithms. So we test both homogeneous combinations where all competing flows adopt the same contract control algorithm, and we also test heterogeneous balanced combinations where each control algorithm is adopted by the same number of competing flows. For each of these configuration, we will run 2 evaluation tools one or a simulator that is based on our fluid model, so that base dissolves the differential equations in the fluid model and an experiment environment that is based the MiniNet network evaluator. From these evaluation tools, we get results, and we compare these results to conduct the validation. We conduct 2 different types of validation. 1 is a trace validation that looks at evolution of network metrics over time. This is the plot that I've just shown. And we also conduct an aggregate results validation, which I will talk about now. So importantly, in this validation, we do not only find that our fluid model is very accurate. but we can also confirm previous insights into PVR performance and generate new insights. So to start with previous insights, our fluid model correctly predicts that BBI version 1 is quite unfair towards loss based congestion control agwidems, in shallow buffers.

And you proceeded our fluid model correctly predicts that up to buffer size of 4 bandwidth 44 bandwidth delayed products. The BBR flows actually obtain almost the complete bandwidth when they compete with cubic flows or renew flows. Our fluid model also correctly predicts that PBR version 2 has largely eliminated this issue. BBR version 2 is considerably more fair towards Cubic And Reno. But note that these results relate to a drop day queuing discipline. And we find also by means of our fluid model, that DTR version 2 is actually still considerably unfair to cubic and Renault under a random early drop queuing discipline. And this It's noteworthy that this is an insight that has not been documented. officially anywhere before. And so our fluid model really was the first tool to deliver this insight. And to go to another previous insights, our food model correctly predicts that BBR version 1 also leads to high loss cello buffers. That's actually the root cause of the unfairness of p b version 1 that we have this discovered beef that we have discussed before. And the fluid model correctly that DVR version 2 leads to very little loss comp like, loss on the order of that is caused by the traditional loss based context control algorithms.

So here, if we see that If the buffer size grows, the buffer utilization by VBLER version 2 first decreases, but then increases again.

To see why, let's consider the probing behavior bandwidth problem behavior of PPO version 2, and how did that the data volume in flight over time. So, generally, PBR tries to keep the data in flight at the estimate of the bandwidth delay product. But in order to discover whether more bandwidth is is available, this band this data in flight is regularly increased to a certain multiple of the bandwidth delay product. However, this increase is stopped early if excessive losses detected, or if the in flight high mark is hit, And this in flight high mark is maybe set in the startup phase of the BBR version 2 flow, but also only if excessive loss. is attack is detected. Now the key insight here is that in large part was barely any loss occurs. And that's why large buffers actually disable these loss based safeguards in VVR version 2. As a result, And this in flight increase never stops early. So that means PBR version 2 probes more aggressive. Flintouch buffers. That's why it measures a higher delivery rate. this measurement of the delivery rate enters into the estimate of the bandwidth delay product, and that means that BBR version 2 keeps even more. data in flight, which then leads to a higher buffer utilization, and that's why We observed this u shaped curve. So a steady state model would actually have difficulty to predict this effect because it's an effect that unfolds over time. However,"

So One category of insights that I just discussed came from this experimental validation. another category of insights that we had came from our theoretical stability analysis. So what do I exactly mean by a theoretical stupidity analysis? In this, you know, theoretical stability analysis, we started with the fluid model that I've talked about now, And this fluid model can be used for simulation and can be can also reflect the small scale features of the standing rate evolution BBR. So the the probing poses that we see here in descending rate curves. However, we then reduced this fluid a full fluid model to a high level model that reflects the microscopic behavior of of BBR in terms of sending rate. And this reduced food model is much more suitable for theoretical pen and paper analysis. Then with respect to the disreduced fluid model, we find the equilibrium. So the steady states, which here are a combination of sending rate distribution and the queue length, from which the standing rate dynamics do not deviate anymore. So combinations which are preserved by the sending rate dynamics. And lastly, we can then investigate is a a curricular with respect to their asymptotic stability. if this equator are asymptotically stable, that means that BBR, in fact, on Burgess. to the steady states. And we can approve this by means of tools from stability analysis such as the lyapunov method. So that's how the stability analysis works. So let's see what results It generated So in our stability analysis, we investigate a different types of, like, colabria, we distinguish BBR version 1 and BBR version 2. And for PPO version 1, we also distinguished debuffers, and shallow Puffers, For PBR version 1, equilibrium, indeed buffers, we find that these"

    "text": "equilibria are not unique, so that means there are possible sending rate distribution to which BBR might converge even in the same configurations And, crucially, not all of descending rate is distributions are necessarily fair. VBR can converge to Unferry, Calibria, However, some of these SendGrid disputes are actually fair, so fairness fair equilibrium is still possible. Also, positively these maybe a 1 equilibrium in deep buffers, do not involve persistent packet loss And they are synthetically stable, so we actually have a mathematical guarantee that BBR converges eventually. Then for shallow buffers, we find different equilibrium properties, interestingly. So here, we find that equilibria are, in fact, unique. They are guaranteed to be fair. And they're also stable. However, they do involve persistent packet loss. And for BP Version 2, finally, we find more or less the same properties for PBR version 1, like, collabia indeed buffers. with one small change. So b fairness in bb version 2aculareba is actually guaranteed under the same round trip time for outflows, and the same guarantee the same conditions do not guarantee fairness for BBR version button. So there's kind of improvement in that respect. So I would like to note here that in all the investigated cases, we could confirm the stability of BBR. However, we have some follow-up work that shows that the stability of PBR does not hold if PBR competes with a traditional loss based control algorithm And we hope to be able to publish these results soon. So with this, I've provided an overview of all our contributions in the paper, and I would like to make some concluding remarks. And I would like to split these"

    "text": "We're concluding remarks in 2 parts, one relating to fluid models, and one to relating to PBR and congestion control in general. So in terms of fluid fluid models, I think our work shows fluid models predict congestion control behavior with surprising accuracy, This accuracy is qualitative, so it allows to kind of rank and contrasting with all algorithms with respect to certain metrics. And it's also quantitative quantitatively accurate. So it gives It predicts with quite high accuracy, for example, how loss will the how high will the loss rate be? And, therefore, our printer fluid models are a valuable complement to experiments in steady state models, so the other two methods that have traditionally been used in BBR analysis We do not think of fluid models as a replacement of these methods in any way because premiums are still the gold standard. in in evaluation, and steady state models are much easier to work with theoretically. However, these combination of these 3 methods So I click quite a powerful toolset to analyze control algorithms. And what we also see a possibility for fluid models to support eventual standardization effort. So if BBR was a word to be ever standardized of fluid models analysis could help to recommend some parameters such parameter recommendation was, for example, done in for earlier congestion control. algorithms. Now turning to BBR and congestion control, I think the overall verdict of our fluid model driven PBR analysis is that DBR version 2 remains an incomplete improvement over BBR version 1. So BBR version 2 eliminates the worst fairness and loss issues of PB version 1. However, it still leads to Some, up for queuing behavior in in other in other cases that might might not be desirable. And the I think these tenacious performance issues just indicated Internet congestion control is just really hard to get right, and I would like to"

So with that, I've arrived at the end of my talk. I'm happy to take questions, and I thank you all for your attention. Alright. Thank you. Excellent talk. I think it's really nice at this both confirms some of the prior experimental and and made some new predictions, which we'll then able to pullouts, Does anyone have any questions for for Simon? Different. Send a request for with future way. My question was, I I don't see in in the model where you have the buffer drug behavior, Like you said, our red is is better than a drop down or the other way, whatever. But what what did that come in into the model Yeah. So i we briefly see just on one slide. Okay."

So this actually gives a brief overview of our complete fluid model So our fluid model actually has more or less two parts on the level structure. 1 is their network model. that describes, basically, the response of the networks that is the left most column here, And there in the in the differential equation that captures the queuing behavior, we can distinguish between drop tail and randomly drop. Thank you. Another question as well was the Do you use like, you have more advanced way of of modeling the dynamics of of the queue then the previous TCP models. Do you use updated models for Cubic or Reno as well or So for the network part of the model, most of this kind of network response modeling have been done in previous work, but we refined this model. in a few ways that actually apply allowed us to obtain more accurate results. But for the Contachment to algorithm models themselves. We just use previous work that this has been done from Okay. Hi. I had a quick question. So if in in the cases where you're application limited, is there any way to tap the model to kinda handle handle those cases. I didn't see a way that any of the functions you're using could capture that behavior. in your name, sir. David Morley, Google. Yeah. So it's definitely not in the model yet. but I think"

Okay. Great. Thank you. k. Thanks. Hi, Simon. Thanks for presenting this. coming from me as a non mathematician and not really understanding the consequences that I wondered if you could tell us something about the scalability of it. I saw you showing in a real life experiment, 3 flows comparing the 3 flows that you did the computations at points in time using fluid model. can it be done for like, a million of these flows, or is it just computationally and feasible? Are there things that we could answer if we could scale it up more? Like, how does it actually operate? Yeah. So, for example, these simulation computations here They were done for 10 flows, and this runs through very quickly, and actually simulating one flow is not that expensive. What becomes expensive if you have a large scale network topology. because you then have to kind of gather the feedback from all queues on the path And Derek becomes expensive, but I think with enough computing power, you can still the results are are the simulation based approach based on the fluid model still quite scalable. and kinda ask one more thing about that then if you so if you were to scale it up with multiple queues in the real, like, campus set of routers is would you want to have to build"

And I think what's what we especially envisioned for the fluid models to do is kind of deliver quickly some first insights that kind of maybe investigated more closely with experiments. So but then you don't have to do the experiments for all the variety of of network configuration. So that's how we see these 2 approaches play together. Okay. Thank you. kinda just ask does this model the startup dynamics or is Just to No. So fluid models in congestion full research. abstract, abstract, the startup and just model that can congestion avoidance. But if you wanted to model the the startup, Like, face or we wanted to investigate the startup phase, we basically have 2 options, either we could just generate another or construct another food model just for a start up and then at some point switch over in the simulation or we could just evaluate the fluid model under a variety of initial conditions, initial conditions for differential equation and then we could actually evaluate the DPR under a variety of startup behaviors. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Alright. Does anyone else have any other questions? I guess not I guess my other not my final in that case would be can you model BPO version free? What changed? Yes. So I I was at the CCWG meeting. on Tuesday, and saw what was presented, and I think the changes that were presented are quite easy to accommodate in the in the fluid Yep. Okay. catch."
