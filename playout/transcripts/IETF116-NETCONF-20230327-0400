There is an I consideration that rob is helping us work through to figure out where to place some of the route registry The clients are the suite of drugs is working through more post last call comments.

The adaptive subscription draft is of course an experimental work in progress is not being discussed in this meeting. Taylor one dot three is post last call commons and is being discussed in this meeting. And finally, the two new drafts both this and transaction Id drafts are work in progress and will be discussed.

Name should be change to not confuse it with the Ip definition. We have looked into that, but changing just the name of on this draft impacts gravy on the? Which is center around and this concept of social domain an opportunity on the main Id. That's why we the authors decided to not change it. To fix this this issue, what we did is remove all the ip references from from this upsell, the main Id them? We are defining the observation domain an main id in the distributed not drops.

But as far, I know the the definitions are pretty same But as far as I understood from your feedback is that we want we want to separate the concepts from Ip and push but I thought when we're discussing it was because the definitions would different between the two. So I think that was why the the concern came up, but I may with the conversation or I may not have understood the conversation. Okay. I. I have, but Alright. My contributor I just wanted to I did notice that you have a grouping that you did make out for Udp to be what I call Udp transport parameters.

So I'm sorry confused by of issue and I recall exactly why I mentioned that, but I have a high level question. So in Ip fix, we've got a notion of It. Typically, this is a line router in which you got the cash and exporting. Is the high level point that for Young push. If you got this Id, which is used for Ip fix, which use the same value if it's sent from a line count. This is a high level goal or not. No as far as I understood, the observation the main Id is the exporter process. But I don't expect to be the same as the Ip six one. Okay. You. So next to slide please.

So the cursor based combination is an opaque cursor. Up to on the entry in list. It would look like this, it would go into the attributes of of the list and have previous and next courses as well.

And it was kind of cal type text and it didn't really belong in there. But it kind of worked because during working good last call. We basically got comments to remove it. So we figured there was no action required to just get it out of there. One of the things that happened was we were referencing seventy three twenty five this.

But, you know, to update our to update R seventy five eighty nine. You really had to say something about Tls one point two. And what you're gonna do with Tls one point three and whether you do one or the other, and Luckily, R c three twenty five already told us what to do, which was you're fine to keep doing tls one point two, if you want, you support tls one point three, do that one instead, kind of like it kind of laid out what to do. So but to get to do the updates we update it. Abby the updates header. Provided some recommendations about cypher suites as well. Because the cypher suite that's in there for Tls one point two, and the base document will not get through the ice there's no way the the or the cypher sweep that was specified in twenty fourteen when make it. So we made it the Cypress sweep it is as close as possible to, which is the one that's listed up there. And we did a little reworking of security considerations where it the the text there was kind of like, hey, please go review this. We kind made a more scripted where it says, you know, the security considerations of of the r c's x y and z apply. So go read those. So we addressed all the known outstanding comments during working group last call. We put a new version. And I believe that we are ready progress to the Ad. Does anyone else have any things that maybe we missed or doesn't like the way we resolved any of them.

For all the things initiated by a given starting point. So we if it's the... If it's the, if it's But then order second transaction would have the same Class Id. So this is basically the the way to simplify the thing. So here, there is a bound id that we could use as on, but actually, we can't because it's not it's that the same the transition is just very insight in the context of traits. So way, to the client? To pass the claim would be to Either on credit in the today's state, which is part of the of the trees bound. Not to take down it's soon as up part of the he does that we can pass through the the chris context. After to get it in away.

There was primarily one big thing that happened in this situation and was some additional logic around how transaction these are handled in the candidate store.

This transaction Id in with candidate data behavior change is that Okay. Let's consider a case where we have a a get conflict towards the candidate data store? Where the most recent transaction id that was in there was three four five six. But when you are reading from the candidate data store, you may have elements in there that have changed versus running but are not committed yet. So the question was okay. So what sort of transaction Id do you report for such? Changed items that are not committed and we decided that two answers are possible for that either you have a mechanism that can foresee what the transaction and Id would be for those elements in the future. And then you can return that value. Or most implementations maybe might not know what it transaction Id will be in the future and they can return the special value exclamation mark.

And the the idea is that this data that can be used by either orchestrate all the controllers or the when they go on export ot, which is a new protocol being the the the side by the native foundation. Two external collectors. So one of the key elements of using the Three to tap into the ecosystem them of collected prices. Loads that exist. There are a lot of commercial and open source tools that are embracing the standards and we have some sometimes screenshot to show you and on upgrade on a pre drop implementation that we have in done already. So in in in it concrete what we're trying to do well we are asking other the working group is to basically a modification of the net comes standard. Where we are Adding"

So next Next slide. And one of the key things that we we we're saying is that, initially, actually, this idea creating... An I'm sharing the tracey called contact information between net compliant and servers. Was originally part of the transaction Id draft the individual contributor drop. But only for the configuration, but then that was dropped. But in the meantime, actually, this idea we say, was developed mother we see only for http and other protocols and all the operations. You know, can you get good parts for. That's why in net we translate that to any Rt rpc. And, of course, there's a lot of back end vendors that are actually embracing all of these concepts. Now that integration with my sure it all is very important because at the end, when you are managing net environment, you wanna reuse the tools that you use see to manage any other application. Okay. Next slide. So just to give you This is exactly an an a cloud example. So like, we took basically an rate on controller both of them sharing trace contact information, Actually, both of them are the same implementation.

And every single choice here share the same place Id So, you know, no need for much machine learning need just Actually, you can correlate things very easily because every every respond on every single action and the on the controller are doing is using the same trace. So next slide, So one of the things to how to clarify the objective here, is actually the electricity is also keeping our three of every single protocol that is actually, exporting or or sherry trace contact information.

One of them is the res part it's very simple it's just to say that the header should be implemented. And as I mentioned in the previous comment.

So just to if if you haven't fall on this closely, there's probably a lot of different drafts and it's and unclear exactly how they relate to each other. Let me try to give you the overview of that. So we are talking about five different drafts that are in the same area. We have this transaction Id, which is now an Adopted one. That was zero have the configuration trace one that you had from John earlier. We had the w three c trace one that we heard about now. We have the pre canned one that's coming right after my presentation here. And we have the et attacks in the Rc eighty four that that's first conference since earlier. And if you look at the sort of use cases that are mentioned in these draft, on the left here. You can see there's is a fairly massive overlap between do use cases that they are relevant in. There are some dependencies between these drafts also that where one assumes that some other draft will take care of it, and there some for the acrylic case. It's... The paint is not dry yet. So we will see exactly how it develop. So this looks like massive open overlap how do we solve this. But we need to actually read those drafts you'll will see that actually, the functionality that is specified is not overlapping that much. So it's there is a good chance that all of these could be made into a coherent framework The problem right now is perhaps that's while they are sometimes referring to each other, the definitions of terms since mechanisms are not done in in the coherent way right now. We need to work on how they should relate to each other anymore. Consistent fashion. So that we get one set of terms and mechanisms."

Jean str actually, we you have the orchestra administrator, you have the controllers and you have some network elements on the bottom. And if you look at what's the private candidates draft is doing it's defining how network elements can have private candidates for different badges like control to one and two, they're separate private candidates in any two. And that is quite useful in those cases. It's not strictly necessary. You can use locking and stuff like that to lock the shared candidates. Get around it, but then you get lower performance some complications. But this is a nice addition. Then we have this draft transaction Id which is adding a sort of local transaction id in every Nat server. And that those transactions ids are also communicated back to the to the client that sits on the north of of this. Device on this server. So that's the yellow parts here. And what we talked about now in this transaction context it's adding a way to spreads a transaction Id from the top going trickle down to all the participating devices. That's the departing green and then reported it back into some sort of Me processor. And what the jean draft is adding is also a way to expose all of these Ids in a yang model if you like. And this melt processor could either use ot protocol or any other methods to access all this information, where it could use this young mapping. And transaction Id mapping if he want to.

You stay there providing good things for this puzzle, but they are actually independently implement and usable. And what I'd like them to see that's we take these use cases, the terminology and aligned behavior And if that is can... If that can happen in these four drafts, the loan documents? Or if you need a fifth documents that's defines use cases terminology and behavior, and then everybody will refers back to that is something that I don't know right now. I'm open to both solutions. But I think we need to align these four documents in order things to be working well. And that was all had. From, please.

The one comment in terms of do you need a framework dot over over document I would generally try and avoid those if you can. So you can get away with Just just getting four drafts and seeing fit together do those first, and then if it need something has to bring them together, then write a fifth document, but hopefully, they can have enough text within them to actually maybe some informative text to say, can also use it with this one in this way or something without necessarily having an overview document.

I was just thinking of the packaging work where we started off with like a problem statement definition and then and view the solution. But I think coming forward, we sort of lost those in the process and we're try not to have it We just will copy some another base spec. The difference with that is those drafts sort of building each other more I think these sort of sits as are set the complimentary. So is slightly different. But not where they gonna to take solution here. Kent as the contributor in between the two ideas that we took forward looking to client service drafts. Each of those drafts have a pre that regard, like, a like a three or four paragraphs describe how those tracks related to the other the suite drinks. Excellent. I think that would be the ideal Benoit. Regarding architecture that criminal not actually I don't care too much, but what we don't want to do is find the trap we need the architecture before doing all works.

We have four use cases actually you you can say the the the first two use cases actually ready you know, relate to the service troubleshooting actually, when you get, we've can deployed and you really need to, you know, do the troubleshooting for the Vpn service and So here, we give these two use cases very similar actually, you need to pre the relationship between the nano service and. So you you will see actually the in in in both case have So it says actually, the lenovo is actually, it's the a instance actually. And then the is, you know, be the And I available or vp id degradation. So we can based on these, actually, we can decide actually we report incident to the Os and based on whether the app really affected service or impact the user experience. So the the other use case actually in in a third cases actually we rely mechanism to perform the servicing impact utterances and So we can know, you know, steps releasing between incident Well, I didn't want to stop your presentation if you like finish So the last use case actually in some cases that you may you consider you know, surprise someone incident. This kind of incident is kinda, you know, four things done because during the cut stage actually you... This is another red ready. So you may label this or surprise"

    "text": "And then some other case you for example, you you want to, you know, consider the energy saving for some network device you to make the the the nano device, you know, sleep in the line. So in this stage, actually, you you need to surprise this kinda incident. So may you enable... You you need to label this kind and and prevented can force incident to be reported to the os or a layer. So next, So also we clarify the relation between the incident inside alarm and performance information actually, you can see this figure we have three different layer We have Os earlier layer. We have domain controller layer we have network layer. So for on top of Os you will receive the service request. So we we you know, different request to the maybe same incident. And in the south bundle not the controller, you can connect, you know, where steven they'll data like data alarm data. So you can take you know, these different data sales data and as an importer. So these will decide whether you will trigger to reporter can and based on whether service is the energy factor. So I like stop here. Yeah. That's all. Alright. As a contributor, my of my questions was you started the presentation that talking about incident reporting and duplication of incidents and considering the previous presentations, we just had on time stamping and source of where particular event is coming from... Do you think it would be to kind of take a look at those draft to see maybe they resolved some of the questions that you have with respect to"

    "text": "how to deal with duplicate incidents. Yeah. Yeah. That that that's a good yes in that why we come here because these working to you know, target it to the trace the travel troubleshooting, and we we think maybe incident in single they kinda tracy information. But we haven't floor yet, But but I think it will be interesting to... Yeah start look at it and you do, you know, raise the discussion on this to take do the list about this? Yeah. Hi. I've got And I've got a couple of questions in all comments. So one is have you compared this work to the same tetra and see how that fits in because it feels like some of this is it's not exactly the same as so quite close that's trying to do the same thing of aggregating different sort of signals of what's going happen in the network I could go down to meaningful useful information that you can then act on. So so I think it'd be good to understand how that fits in. The other one is obviously the d mode draft in ops has incident management in there. So how does this compare to that is that just... Is this trying to just up tracked and take it out or was there's something different in terms of what it's trying to do and achieve And then the last one, I think is the comment about using machine learning. And put aside Chat, that's doing great things. I think that Thomas was talking about that they had looked at machine learning and found it wasn't that's effective. And again, it may, you know, may have moved on but I was get slightly worried when I see machine learning Ai and these things because I think sometimes it's over. But smoky. Yeah. Yeah. And then we we we may have some concern around this information machine learning. But I mean they started, you know, explore some Ai of challenges. So this maybe a good opportunity Still these kinda promising, you know, chat Tv end this kinda things it could really have or you know reduce, you know, the the pressure on the, you know, management system. So and we need to, you know, read it"

    "text": "Yeah. Then maybe the cautious about it, that we need to also called the the the the the benefit also and to try to avoid any you know, some other downside. Yeah. So Yeah. Hi. Thomas. From Swiss come. So First of all, thanks a lot for this work. And I think it's very valuable and also I think it's very good that it's building on top of the existing young model on alarm event. So I think that's very valuable. And to answer one of the questions I've been reviewing the draft and I see basic with the work have been introducing before it's actually aligning well, what you're presenting in here basically adding additional metadata so that basically the the network device can be better identified and also adding bit time being basically where observation time of the network is being this guy. So I think it works very well together. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. We can talk about take offline. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Connect speaker. I just wanted to say you're not in the queue. It would be go ahead and identify yourself and then It's okay. You can go ahead. If you're not logged in, but I just didn't see you in the queue. I just need to like I can really let just later actually. I wanted to ask you one question if you are considering in this work that also in the own network devices, there they participate also in this incident, management so the their own devices can to some sort of health operations sort of some and that they instead of just reporting us they now. Reporting a lot of once some threshold is crossed or something like that or or just"

Thank you. Alright. Any other questions or comments? No. If not close the last presentation and the the end of the net con agendas open mic at this point. Rob, so made a comment on the client's serve suite of draft and reviewing. So I've sent comments on two those drafts to the left, this... I've actually Think I've probably reviewed about another four of them so got comments write up and send. So hopefully, that all happen probably not this week, maybe not next week somewhere sometimes soon. So I'm getting through those. I think one of the key questions that's come up there though, I reviewing those was about how we handle these keys that are built into the device and how we represent all reference those from the configuration. So I've sort of punt that issue to the nets mode and and and on the sort of system, data stored draft, and that and also N nda because I think there's some interesting questions there. But you want to track that. That might be an interesting conversation to see how that resolves. But I think we need to find a way that we can use these keys effectively without necessarily having to copy them in or something."
