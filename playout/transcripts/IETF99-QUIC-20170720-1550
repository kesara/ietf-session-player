    "text": "Sanjay Mishra verison just couple of observations so I think when we had the Charter discussion quite a bit of time was spent about network monitoring and network management I should say so at the end of those discussions and then what was clear was that there certainly is a need for network management in order to make sure that there\u0027s some level of accountability in terms of how quick is performing and some other things think you\u0027re already agreed upon so now here we are discussing a solution that might be fitting that charter requirement so if you go back and now when the solution is presented and then question what was already agreed in the Charter is then I think in ways we\u0027re taking steps back so certainly fine to discuss this that maybe we should you know add this back to the Charter and go back and make sure that you know we\u0027re all clear with the Charter and what you know quick is going to be delivering so it moves upon us to you know go back and you know relook at the Charter if if the question comes up when you\u0027re looking at the solution so the Charter says that the group should consider current practices all right it does yeah yeah and so which is which is so this is a consideration but it also says the quic protocol need not be defined to enable each of these abilities or enable them in the way as they are enabled by TCP when used with TLS one three but the working group must consider bla bla bla that\u0027s that that\u0027s that\u0027s what we\u0027re doing right and and yeah and then just wanted to also make sure that when other things that Ian in your presentation at the very upfront I think maybe a second sentence of the second word in the in the presentation it says that almost all the data is encrypted so I think so you know let\u0027s just be careful about you know the concerns that you know that might be there with exposing the information in the RTT but you know as you said it\u0027s you know much of the data is encrypted you know most of it so got a balance that we want to make sure that quick is deployable and and we can measure how well it is performing and I think one of the reasons why we are having this discussion in working group and quick is because the Google is implementation of work has been successful and they\u0027ve been able to demonstrate that look how it improves over TCP so I think we\u0027ve seen the evidence that with the measurement that you have shown in the past so this is probably not a whole lot different that allows us the tool to do the measurements yeah I want to come back to China\u0027s example because I think that\u0027s actually a good example to underline Ted\u0027s point because the information that were ossified here and it\u0027s really sad to see that and it\u0027s a real problem was information that was not meant to be shared with network just because it was "

    "text": "justified say the point actually is whenever we share information was the network it should be explicitly even before the network and it should not have any dependencies on the internals of the protocol so that we still be able to evolve the protocol even if there\u0027s no certification or whatever so that has to be separated and I think that\u0027s a lesson learned from the past and the other point I wanted to come back on your own last question you had towards like what\u0027s the difference and I said complexity and actually difference between like what you can do today and giving the signal and complexity is one point accuracy at one point so to go a little more into detail you can look at like trafficker hysterics and behavior and you see the flow and you see the user or whatever and at some point you can get around to time measurement and then you know the round time of that flow but like what this mechanism you get like round document measurements all the time so you get more information you can actually use it for your network management you can figure out what\u0027s happening right now so while you you still have the security risk if you don\u0027t do it because round of time can be into or can be seen based on your traffic characters you don\u0027t get any of the advantage by doing it it also it doesn\u0027t scale so while you know you can probably do this search effort detection for like most of the flows maybe you cannot do it for everything while here you have like an exit signal that actually gives the information you need for your network monitoring and troubleshooting just to interject we\u0027re gonna cut the queues because we do want to be able to wrap up if I can channel what I think TKG would say to this and he can correct me is that it\u0027s a different quality of information and that\u0027s the difference but one is that it\u0027s actually a timely signal that\u0027s there and you can react to it in a timely manner the other one requires you to do some this is individual sorry is this large individual versus chairman trying to write it down right it is individual thank you but but I think that that\u0027s what what what dkg is that or is it different and the question is what kind of information if any should the group it\u0027s it\u0027s a different kind of animation that\u0027s what I\u0027m saying and in in one hand you like and I think for both kind of informations you have the same privacy risk why one of the information is also useful for what we wanted for so I should have I should not have opened that worm I\u0027ll be very quick you you said my name three times and I appeared at the mic I think that what I just heard me to say is that one approach provides you with massive pervasive monitoring information and the other approach provides you with targeted monitoring capabilities no one approach provides you like one round trip time measurement and the other one provides you information over time and that\u0027s just like to do completely different information doesn\u0027t matter like how much by to take to store the information or whatever yeah I think we agree thank you okay Andrew bring us home you know so I think the thing is if we do this and expose this information it\u0027s whether or not you do it you still "
