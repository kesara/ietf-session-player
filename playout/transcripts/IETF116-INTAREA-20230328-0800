And this is because the the topic of ether types is also related to the draft, and then that's something that was happening at the Ie triple or two a couple of weeks ago. In Atlanta. So it's been noted that there are discrepancies which in the public ether type lists. There is one list that and you see the first link there from standards or Ui. I to believe org if type Ethernet. And then there's another one that we normally discussed here ai work assignments, how to the two numbers. And as you may be aware, and we've been discussing in in the light of seventy forty two days, the official leader title list the on the ie triple rack. And that's the absolute reference. I work However, there important practical in this case, protocol usage information that is only found in the Aya or list.

Let's say a new column that is you use useful information from Mariana or something like that. And that part we can transfer whatever we have in the two numbers. This doesn't have to apply to every single time because not single type associated to a negative protocol. But at least the ones that are important for us we can we can highlight them. In that way, it'll be one single reference and people would not be confused about it. As a note and and, again, in the context of seventy, forty to this explain, an review and patient processes exists already to officially contribute information to the Rack. From It approved sources, meaning that it's not any information that will show up in this and this ether type list coming from.

They're searching cases where there... Where either type of occurs and they would like the t. Is about twelve cases of tweaking references or definitions there couple terms they wanted definitions to be added for some references to their documents that they want move from informational norma no the things, you know, these are all pretty inaccurate things. There's five cases where they wanted vendors specific change to organizational specific I think vendor specific is more commonly used in the etf and was earlier used in Ie documents, but I guess they've changed to the more correct actually, because these things are basically based on... As based on what on O ui, which are organizational unique identifier. So it should always have been called organizational. As in the cover letter.

So there were two improvements. They wanted and that's getting down low enough that I could say what they are. One was where it said in the in the he it says in the current draft, the I has done something and they wanted to say. Ie eight zero two has done something. Seems like an improvement. Another case they has wanted a few words to clarify bit ordering. The bit ordering in the draft is the standard etf quite a bit ordering, but as just no problem is sticking in a few words just to clarify that a little bit. There are two cases where they wanted to remove information that's currently in the graph, which as far as I know is true, but they didn't want it be there. One is that it says that they have in the past considered, I in the past is considered, hundred and twenty eight bit mac addresses. I think this is not like, it's true There's actually an expired Etf graph, which mentions this, but they just don't want the draft to say that, I guess. The other case it talks about certain kind of ether type and then we'll see protocol chaining which I believe is required to be supported. And they would like that removed. I don't think these are big deals it's.

So the first one is the drag there's a a new thing called Slap, which did sub devi previously a local Mac addresses. I think it's currently still optional into four quadrant. One of them is called standard design. And I was in the room there two at one when this was the discussed at some point I'm not haven't actually consulted the necessarily the most recent addition of the document The idea was these are mac addresses that are assigned through some kind of local allocation protocol. Kind of the way, you know Dhcp assigns Ip addresses and things. So the draft currently says that they'd be assigned by some by a protocol, but doesn't say anything further. They want that to be changed to say it's assigned via protocols specified in an ie eight zero two standard. And I... I'm not sure if the original document says that, but that's what they wanted. And that seems like not true or Correct, because we have an Rf on the Santa track Eighty nine forty seven, which tells how to use auto assign Mac addresses using an Vertical. So Merely, they didn't ask what it to say, only by protocol eight or two standard. There nevertheless it kind of implies that And the other possible problem that change is they wanted some changes very trivial. Changes in the Ie statement, which I included as appendix b. So one is this capitalizing tea and either type And the other is the current statement refers to I standard eight zero two lower lowercase a.

Eight two dot one on it. As we do these various steps. That's my my opinion, what it should happen. Okay. So Let me put myself in there in the queue. Thanks thanks for for the presentation.

So Well I would also... So I think that basically, I can effectively accept all the suggestions. Not the exact wording, but move.

Obviously, I you'll will fix the second one, so that's not a problem. So so the first one, the way I understand is, you you're right like, not all verticals protocols are specified in Electrical triple, so, but that's something we can clarifying the in the liaison letter. Right? So we get sure say something in the liaison later along those lines. Yeah. We produce a version that addresses that this way we can. And then we wait to hear from them. I guess. The only problem I have with that is that you know, the the when this was brought up at the last My meeting, and I I presented the draft there's nothing official, but informally, I was told that I eight two was meeting the following week, and we should hear back maybe at the end of that week.

Ip six will be similar things two zero one, Dba, one to three plus two three seven one. Again, this is another reference selected by administrator of the local network. So we're talking a p before P six, but actually the network address works reference next. I have to make sure that it's well I understood that this drug discusses private network only. Okay. So Ip is for private network networks like private to private only. But you should notice that so public addresses are merely exposing hosts located on private networks already. So that last point is very, very important, especially down the line is really the key right now, it might not be obvious why. This is so maybe knows that but that's important at this point.

So that's the idea. The next logical step was Ip six are two because of some of those credit networks might be running different protocols. So it talking of network space. So that works and again, we're talking Ip six Ip four, but it already works for anything. I think this is important because it allows to develop. That's working browser.

They're connected by third network. The two network could be anything, but of course, for practical purpose we talking internet here. But I'd like to note my mention sure that one particular case of the two network is all network or no that whatsoever So they can I guess click connect to those sort directly with some So there were cable or some radio link or something like that? So let's go back to the to the internet. So Purposely one of those networks, the one on the left, you say before other Ip section thereafter have an Ip before on the example site would be.

I if others is allocated but the local network be, so whoever all the total and there is no negotiation whatsoever. The way they define it is. That's that's it. This could be passed to the network many means, including Dns, so dns not required. That's the example in the draft. Here is I'm using the Dns is just to show that those addresses are published.

Now there is a little bit of application if I has no idea our ip are because a five around just a straight Ip before. It is the gateway that understands Ip. Okay. And then this is the gateway. That can see reference. Show the package by way this reference is will go into the packet between a gateways g a and g. But they will not appear on the local networks. So if I will never see. So for this to work, there is a concept of projection or any encoding network. So that the is result realizes this is an Ip others, so it's if I would not understand it calls it into Ip that in intel what a five does understand which is likely for So this is what the encoding network is. And at the bottom, it's network ten one twenty eight that zero zero last ten and note that that Ip address presented but That would be Is encoded as ten one twenty eight. Sorry. Then Sorry.

As far as the sun control playing, we have two dimensions of the consideration. The first one is is that we are of to service requirements.

Thanks very much for giving us the thirty seconds. We just wanted to say that we've put a draft out onto the list for trusted domain S sr six. And it's just a request that people can take a look at the draft give us comments feedback. We will be pushing a draft zero one of that within the next probably twenty four hours, and I wanted to say thanks very much.
