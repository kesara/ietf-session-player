Kanchana sometimes is working with elephants these are real-life solutions for people who are not connected so we are dedicated to connecting people obviously the whole IETF focus is connectivity but many of you know what it\u0027s like to do the real-life complicated things where something may not work last week a friend of mine had to hack a solar panel because the solar panel wasn\u0027t working through the throughput from the batteries was just not working they pretty much cut all the cables to all the batteries and rewired the whole thing on the side of the mountain not even close to spec that had been submitted so as many of you know you "
