Patrick\u0027s Day which happened on the weekend in case for those new who weren\u0027t here Alexa was wandering around as a leprechaun as was I think Stephanie and she as you can see it was not wearing a red lanyard and gave me consent to use her photo in the plenary so kudos to AMS thank you so much for all that you do for the IETF today we will have our sort of typical agenda so welcome to the plenary we will hear from our one of our hosts at this meeting and then we\u0027ll have brief updates on hot topics so as people have seen in the plenaries the last couple of years we have sent out many reports in advance of the plenary that contain a lot of detail about all the things that are going on in the IETF and we are attempting to make the plenary presentations short and to the point and highlighting just the most current issues for the community so well "

    "text": "saying this as a good thing as a draft frames the problem as as if encryption was a problem because it prevented all the sort of things that operators would like to do a typical example is section 2 3 4 which describes other HTTP other insertion in the HTTP flow when the operator adds personal information such as the phone number as an HTTP header so the website at the other end I have more information this sort on also the rosters of this action the specific technique is sometimes seen as questionable it\u0027s not sometimes seen as questionable it\u0027s awful it\u0027s bad on if encryption prevents it it\u0027s precisely what was invented for so I think that this draft sends a very bad message it will clearly be read once published as RFC it will be seen on describe going back after RFC 7258 on will be Kelly will be discussed on presented as if I ETF went back on encryption so I mean as I\u0027m sure everybody knows this document has had a long and very past it\u0027s gone through multiple IETF loss calls and yes there\u0027s a lot in it that doesn\u0027t make everybody happy but what it is trying to do and perhaps doesn\u0027t do perfectly in fact we\u0027ll say it doesn\u0027t do perfectly is the judgment-free throughout no we tried the author tried multiple times to remove any sort of judgment and Chris try to be these are things that people do by the way you should know about them if you\u0027re going to be running a network I don\u0027t really know what more I can say on that but I\u0027m sure there are many other folk here who can can you speak to the consensus on it where we landed on the consensus text that might be useful finally find the draft between we published we took the approval thing on Monday what the consensus better to know but that can you or can you explain the yeah and it\u0027s one of the very very few documents where that we\u0027ve ever published that has the consensus but set you know what which shows up differently and the boilerplate so if you have a look in the data tracker maybe that wasn\u0027t here if you have a look in the data tracker it\u0027s got consensus knows so it has the different boilerplate on the front of it once it\u0027s published it will have the different boilerplate on the front of it so I don\u0027t think I explained that very well but hopefully that helps at Eastham or can alleviate your concerns and I\u0027m sure Kathleen has more sure and I\u0027ll keep it short so this was a follow on "
