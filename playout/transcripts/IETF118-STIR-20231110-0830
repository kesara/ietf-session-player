    "text": "This is a spiel I've given many times since we have discussed this document here many times, but way back in you know, a dinosaur era when dinosaurs roamed the earth of a fellow by the name of John Lwell produced a specification called RFC-4916. And this was based on our original identity header, RFC 4474, which did not make such a big splash in the world back when we released it, but it first gonna specified the idea you could sign a subset of a SIP request and people relying parties could use that to ascertain the authenticity of the sender. But John looked at a different problem, which was connected identity, was the issue of okay. Once we've established, you the instigating party is for a SIP session how do we ascertain who was actually reached? And, he developed a fairly complex process for doing this, which was predicated on the use of things cracks and, you know, doing various things with mid dialogue requests to clarify who the endpoints were in them, And this is related to, like, some legacy stuff that even predates RFC 32 one that goes back to the original SIP RFC, that have, dialogue matching constraints require the to and from, but always be identical before things were gonna work. And, like, we long since hope we didn't have to worry about that anymore. But anyway, 4916 addressed that. And we went out to say, okay. Great. That was written for 4474. What would we do now in the world of RC82 24 and the modern stirs specifications. And what we ultimately decided after I did some initial very ill considered efforts to map John's original mechanism onto processing was offers a greatly simpler approach. And this greatly simpler approach, we simply defined a new passport type. Is called RSP for response. These passports can only appear in responses. And, you know, their their use is not necessarily limited to SIP, if we wanted to talk about out of band,"

And you can think of it up, like, if you're familiar with the div mechanism we created for call forwarding for diversion, where if you send, you know, invite with a passport to an entity that's going to forward the call the type of passport that entity generates actually, signs the guest field rather than the origin field of passport. Because what you really want in this diversion case is to know that it was the entity that is you know, receive this that is responsible for the original target number that is saying it's okay to forward this on to someone else. So similarly, RSP is signed via the That's the high level thing. Next slide. I lost my cursor. Yeah. So there's a new 4 version that we did already have a working group last call, but after working group last call, and I believe it was about 15 minutes before our previous, ster meeting in San Francisco, Jonathan Rosenberg said a number of comments about this. And, I think they were all useful interventions. And so I made a couple of updates reflect that. One is that I added the 2 factor authentication use case explicitly to the motivation. Since one of the things that's really interesting about connected identity if you think how this might be leveraged in practice. Are cases where you're either using a call or a message, you're like an enterprise, a bank, something like that, and you want to validate that, in fact, you are, you know, the entity with a telephone number of record is the person you are communicating with over the web wouldn't it be great? If you actually got some assurance, a stir like assurance, from, whoever has you, you're reaching out to, that the number you're calling is in fact the number that's thing. So we put that in. Jonathan had a couple of comments about police where we made normative statements that were kind of in the middle of a paragraph and were assuming you'd read the rest with a paragraph, but if you just took that sentence in isolation, they could probably be read a bit too broadly. So, we we carve those things up and hopeful hopefully fix them"

    "text": "You know, there is no, capability negotiation that we defined in connected identity. We don't leverage the traditional SIP mechanisms like required and supported and things like that. To ascertain do both parties on the ends of the session actually support connected it in any mechanism or not. So previously, it had some language in there that was like, look, If you get response identity, connected identity, know, you should always then sign further mid dialogue or dialogue terminating requests and responses as the session continues. Jonathan felt that was a little too strong. And ultimately, I think I agree. So we Drop that to a should. And, you know, I still think that because there are a lot of interesting broad use cases, especially in the international mobile space. These are things like, RSF, if you're familiar with these kinds of threats, where having just the ability to know the buy that the, the session terminating message in SIP came from the right entity and not from some middleman is trying to make it appear like the call is a little bit longer than it is. To one of the sides of this because there's some, like, toll arbitrage thing they can exploit for that. You know, because of that, I think it still really is valuable. To if we want to apply stir to those kinds of fraud cases, but, like, I'm like an insist on it. So sure, should seem okay. And finally, we clarified this is not supposed to work for cancel. And, you know, cancels their questions if that you send after you've sent an invite, to say, like, actually, let's just tear this session down. Obviously, if you think about it, just the way I described it, well, isn't this a vector for DDoS? Couldn't people you know, be, synthesizing, cancel messages, to tear down requests and without stir, oh my god. We have this, like, huge gap in the security of this. The problem is cancels get issued for all kinds of reasons by, like, intermediaries who are doing parallel or sequential"

We just don't want people to expect that you're necessarily going to receive it. And then if you don't see it, that's like a big problem. So that's what I did in 4. Next slide.

Stir shirts. So we all know that, a tremendous amount of work has been done. In fact, by some people sitting in this room on, PKI and X509 in particular in questions about how you make sure that a certificate that you are dealing with, you are relying on, actually, has not expired and remains fresh at this moment. And so there's a ton of preexisting work on this, which we have done our best to cannibalize. But there is just something a little bit different about the way that stir leverages X 509. That is the presence of this extension. The TN authorization list. And the TN offers list. It's a bucket of, potentially what we call service provider codes in North America. That would be operating company numbers, OCNs, or spids, be other things in other jurisdictions. I've seen some interesting one off uses of SBCs as well in the wild that I don't approve of. But, you know, this, this is one way of populating the TN authors The other is list of TNs for which you were authorized, literally have a list of literal telephone numbers that you enumerate, It could be ranges. It could be individual numbers, that are actually baked into the cert itself. So any relying party looking at the cert is gonna be able to say either, okay."

And if the originating number, then the passport does or respond with that. You might really wanna think about relying on that. That might not be an excellent idea. But therein lies their rubs. See, if you bake into a cert. List of telephone numbers, the problem is telephone number ownership is kind of dynamic. There are all kinds of factors that can lead of a party that could potentially be a signature for stir. And number portability is 1, just mergers and acquisitions. So just ordinary business, hey, we're shutting down that call center, and we're not using those numbers anymore. So we've been looking for some time in a couple of approaches to this. The favored ones seem to be doing OCSP, the online search certificate status protocol and short lived certs there's a lot of subvariance next slide. So, Jack, probably like a year ago now, maybe more, sent a nice list to the mail in which he enumerated what he saw as the options in play around this. Now in the baseline RFC 8226, specification, which is where we define the TN auth list, extension to X509. We already talked about using the AIA extension in order to be able to, point to by reference rather than baked into the cert, like, through a URL what the TN auth list is that the CERT is valid for. And that's an attractive option because then really, you can update that list on the other end of that URL, like, as much as you want. And, you know, if you need things to move in or out, that's great. What's the problem with it? Well, the main problem is you're then revealing through that URL that is at that anybody can access what all of the numbering resources are."

    "text": "That you possess, right? And there are some carriers who expressed of reservations about this. They weren't sure for competitive reasons. They really wanted have to divulge the entire set of telephone numbers potentially that they they have, to the world in public service, which means just anybody can get them. Then we started talking about OCSP. And Sean Turner and I, and I should say Sean did most of the work on here actually understands OCSB far better than I do. Look, did a potential extension that we could build to the online, certificate status protocol. And this is something that's fairly widely, Sorry. Is there a n, So ignore us. Okay. Some something that's fairly widely used in, Did I advance on that? Yeah. You did advance. I'm not quite done yet. I'm gonna go through this. We got plenty of times, my understandings, and we found free free drafts to talk about here. So you know, OCSP basically allows you in real time to check that, the certificate remains valid at the time a relying party can use it. This has been widely used in some flentations of web PKI in web browsers, there are alternative approaches now perhaps at more traction, like simply pushing certificate revocation list down to the browser itself on some schedule. You see that in browser like Chrome. But it's still widely supplemented. There's a lot of libraries for it. No reason not to use it. So we extended that to be able to pose a different question than OCSP usually does. Which is This certificate, is it still valid for the following telephone number? And you just get back a binary yes or no answer. You're no longer having to download. Well, if this certificate covers million telephone numbers is you're not gonna download a list of that. You're gonna do is push this OCSP query and get back from the o c OCSP server a response that says, thumbs up."

    "startTime": "00:20:03",
    "text": "You asked if, like, this number is in the scope of the cert, it is it isn't, And that seemed like an approach that had much better privacy and everything else. So we specified that. Issue is, of course, that means that you're stir verification service on the terminating side, which is the relying party, that, has to then do in RTT. To go, like, make a query up to this, get this back. That could lead to postile delay or just delay in processing the call. It kinda seemed like a hassle. And it also, unfortunately, also reveals to the OCSP service something about a call in progress. Right? So from a data minimization perspective, you're actually taking the hit of knowing in that instance, this particular terminating provider received a call for this telephone number at this time. And that's a little bit sensitive. So, instead we start looking at a stapling approach, we had previously broken this out into a separate draft. I guess I should explained that, what is stapling. So stapling was something that was also developed for the web PKI to solve more or less the same problem in, stapling instead of the, browser, browser, effectively having to go out and query this OSP service to determine, is this the right certificate for Amazon.com? Is this not expired and everything else? Instead, Amazon kind of pre pushes down in your, you know, initial setup, your TLS, and, HTTP connections you're making to Amazon's web service, actually, like, pushes down with that Here's a staple. That is what you would have gotten if you queried OCSP. So that, like, you know now that this is legit and you don't have to, like, bother coming and asking some service about it. So it speeds things up. And, for that reason, we thought it would be attractive to do that. With STIRR as well. So we defined a new, stir claim for that that appears in passports, which I'm gonna talk about in a minute."

  {
    "startTime": "00:22:02",
    "text": "So that's one broad approach. Do this with OCSP with stapling or no, the second broad approach is to do this with short lived certificates. And short lived certificates have the virtue of, being able to be customized down even to the level of an individual telephone number. So that know, you could even imagine on a per call basis, a stir authentication service that's going to sign passport, you know, could you know, synthesize a sir, that is just for the telephone number that is in the arid field of the passport. And all the relying party gets. Then when they receive this, this passport, is assert that Vouches, yes, for the moment, for whatever brief interval this is a legit search to be signing for that particular telephone number, And that comes with If you have a lot of telephone numbers, you're going to be generating and synthesizing a lot of certs. It also unfortunately suffers from the same RTT problem on the patient service side in that the x5u parameter of, passport, which we borrowed from JOTS, from JWT, It requires an HTTP dip that would be performed by the terminating side by the verification to go fetch this shortness certificate. And unfortunately, these don't have good cash ability properties. Ordinary stir shaking operations, you get, you, you know, these certs are very long lived. A service provider cert could be valid for years. That wouldn't be the case for these. These would only be valid for a, for a very small amount of time. Can't cash them, so you gotta fetch them a lot. Alright. So what can we do about that? Well, it turns out there is some protocol stuff we can rely on for that, which I've now built into short lived. So that's the options in play. And next slide, this is what we've, like, boiled this down to now. And I guess I probably did basically speak to all that already. So next next slide,"

Its job is to carry within the passport, what the OCSP response would be. If you asked. For that particular with this extension that John and I developed, you asked, is this certificate still valid for this particular telephone number? We're just gonna, like, bake that. Into the passport. And you get it, the time you get the passport, you have no need to contact OCSP for it. Seems pretty cool. And so we just decided to make that part of the baseline draft. And for short lived, our proposal is to carry a certificate chain via the X5C parameter, which is defined in JWS and RC 75, 15. And that's serves basically the same purpose as a staple. Instead of using X5u, rare the, you know, the relying party on the shirt cert has to go fetch the cert we're just gonna push the cert itself in the past word and the entire chain of everything you need, to validate that cert because, of course, this could be you need to have the that the root you know, CA's public cert and then you need to have whatever the service provider cert is and potentially even a delegate So this could be a substantial chain, and it can indeed go further. You could have sub delegations and things like But you just take all that, you put it in, and you just push it in the passport. But bear in mind is a big staple. Next slide. Yeah.

Like, if you're gonna have 3 certs that you're pushing in this it's gonna be big. Much bigger than stable. Especially. Now that, that, that, I think that example in 7515 is not an ECD say say, CERT example, I think it's, you know, so we, we may get some bite savings if we actually, like, mock up what this would look like. But The bite savings are not gonna be terribly substantial. We also do need to fix the example of stapledose OCSP and the new 06 version of that draft. I have asked my coauthor, Mr. Turner, to please do that because I spent so much trying trying to get open SSL to incorporate a proprietary extension it was not familiar with.

We just get that example fix, that should be good. But next slide, Oh, wait. No. No. Stay here. Sorry. But there is one thing about short lived I've wanted to actually point to, and this is something Chris and I were just talking about over lunch on Wednesday. We do have some normative language in that draft now about support for X5C. Because no stir shaking implementation. The world today supports this. Right. Right.

Like, how long short lives should be for the purpose where we really wanna say, you should use this X Five C thing, if your certificate falls below this threshold of expiry. I think a week is a pretty good start.

John, John This this is not about the adopt or advance thing. In Lance, we did adopt the 50 19, biz draft, which is an update to which the stapling one relies on. And so that the point of that draft, which about to go on a working group last call is getting rid of Shaw and making it a shot 56. So this the OCSP draft we have here might get shorter because there's less stuff to profile. Okay. So that's that's nice, but I think that shouldn't stop us going forward because it says the same thing. Shockingly, I'm possibly an author on that one too. So that worked out well. But the nice the nice thing about that particular draft is that we didn't wanna write was actually gonna do it. So Apple will just sort of actually record in there. So, like, there's actually hope that it will be easier to be able to get things that sign things, and you don't have to, like, lose hair trying to make it work. So thanks. Can we just have a quick, like For you? Sorry. Chris Went. Discussion about the size of a staple versus X Five C, including there any intuition there that So Yeah. I I feel smaller.

Actually tried to attend the working group meeting the other day And it was unlike this room, standing room only crammed in, like, sardines. A lot of people really into this MLS stuff. These days. So, what what did on this, Richard Barnes has been one of the protagonists in, the development of MLS I reached out to him. Had a conversation and recall by the pool, outside in, SFO. And talked about kind of what this integration might look like. Between STIRR and MLS. And, Richard's guidance about this effectively that we should define a new set of MLS credential types for this. That is the approach that we You can look at this as a bit of a sequel to the, recently I mean, I know the RC number. I just need to push some buttons on, on 48. The recent, stir for messaging draft, which outlines a number of use cases that might utilize, stir for messaging, including, RCS. And it turns out that there's been some talk, including, I believe, since the past IPF, even some public statements about the integration of MLS into RCS, and that is a potentially very interesting interaction. Because as we all know, RCS is largely set up with SIP transactions, and that would make a big win for us, if we found a way to give MLS a story about how it could leverage credentials that attest ownership of telephone network resources, because it turns out there's still a lot of messaging out there in the world that uses telephone numbers as identifiers. Right? And, like, wouldn't it be great if there was a way that you could identify group members, nonetheless, as, you know, by the telephone number that they are attaching through. So our 00 draft, we specify 2a half purchase. Next slide."

Allows you to specify either service provider codes, or telephone numbers or telephone number ranges. MLS already has a potential type for X509. I have had some people come up to me this week and say, aren't you just using that? Or why don't we, like, redefine MLS credential type 0 to include a, RC 8226 certificates. Personally, I think, 8226 certificates are different enough that I would probably keep these as separate credential types. Because it's not like you're gonna get some standard X509 library that supports TN Office and the things associated with it, Now doing this with certs, there's kinda 2 sub approaches here, and that's why I call this 2a half approaches. There's kind of an approach and a half built into this first for slide here because, of course, these certs could have service writer codes, those operating company numbers that I mentioned earlier, And in that instance, Interestingly, the cert doesn't really communicate anything about the identifier, of an MLS group member. All it communicates is there's a carrier who is vouching for this person. So you in that instance, you would have to rely on the MLS application. The application is using MLS to actually convey what those identifiers are. And this is not an uncommon case. When you think about MLS, know, it the the similarity of the name MLS to TLS is not accidental, really is kind of a, a, you know, middle layer right, between the transport and the application that is there to provide this set of security features. And so you end up relying on the application to do a lot basically, when you use MLS anyway, but it does mean that"

It did, and we would not be here today without A wonderful compromise was brokered by Henning Shulter, and if I recall in a food court, outside, it's like across the street from the FCC where we agreed that this was how we could actually get this, at least, off the ground in the US. But there is an alternative. The alternative is, of course, delegate certificates, delegant certificates are, children, sub instruments of those SPC hurts. That are specific to particular telephone numbers And, with delegate certs, of course, they do explicitly assert This is the telephone number for which my certificate is valid. And, you know, that is a very attractive security property for MLS usages in particular. And, you know, we wrote Brandy, and I a number of its perpetrators are present in in this room, I believe, the Richard Barnes, hopefully, is online, maybe too early. For him, him to be here. But, you know, that was really trying to define an overall and end architecture that would allow media security to be bootstrapped on to stir assurances. This is a project we did. It is RRC. 8862, I think, if anyone is interested. But that is obviously the most secure mode overall for integration that we're gonna propose among these two and a half approaches.

It's just I was as I was walking up, I was anyway. Next, next slide, please. Alright. So we defined a second MLS credential type in this. For passports. And so why did we do this? We did this because passwords are really good at making explicit who the member would be up in MLS have a ton of tools in this. We have the Ridge. We have our CD. We could be provided We name names. If we can provide him pictures and, like, doing all this stuff that whatever the application is using MLS would be able to consume and have, like, a strongest security assurance for. And moreover, because we built into passport this, a claim that is called the Emkegee. MKey can actually carry a hash over a public key that is being used for MLS. That seemed to provide a pretty solid binding. This is, in fact, the way that SIP Brandy works weird. Just creeping this from what we did for SIP Brandy. But, you know, that comes the caveat and the caveat is, of course, if that passport assigned by an SPC search than, that empty parameter.

One is that people who own the namespace, like you make assertions about things below them, and the other is, you know, 3rd party, which tends to verify directly that license protocols within the database then they make decisions about them.
