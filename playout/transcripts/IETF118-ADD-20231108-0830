The document has passed the working group last call, but, next slide, Tommy Jensen had raised, and to a good comment, I would say. I mean, that was overlooked right with regard to DDR. That basically deals with an attack that, with GDR, the resolver in for resource record type could be spoofed by an attacker. That attack is not possible with, GDR, is only possible with GDR because we can't use DNS like that. Because, CDN is not, unique. Whereas that attack is not possible with TNR and the IP to configuration for pretty, you know, so we were discussing in the working group what is the best way to, fix that problem. Next slide. Yeah. So, a simple way we thought we could address that problem was to add a new secret tribute. The signature will be calculated for all the fields within the resolve and info. Using the private key of the certificate, and the client has to validate that signature using the public So that gives the data engine authentication for resolving for even if, data sync is not being used. And the recommendation is, we only need the single attribute for TDF. Next slide. Ed here. Here you go. It's working. Thanks."

I mean, yeah, one of the, I think Ben had raised several good comments on the working group, making lists that, it's gonna not gonna work in deployments who are, dealers who are in the DNS logic or separated. And, yep, that's a limitation that, if is clear text traffic between the TLS Terminator and DNS server. It won't work, but still goes against the 0 trust security framework. There was some some other up to that some of these attributes, cannot be validated by the client, whether the server is indeed, saying the right, information with regard to its resolver attributes or its line. Right? But the biggest advantage of this mechanism is that he would still get data or gene authentication to prove that the data has been generated by the resolver self and not by an attacker for some of the attributes, like, extension errors. The explicit test can be done by the client. Are instance, info URL is specifically for troubleshooting purposes only. It's not it's not used for selection or for displaying that to the end user. And and and resolver info is quite flexible to be extracted new attributes can be easily added, which can be attested or verified. So the various possible solutions were discussed in the working group to restrict resolver info to just TNR and other use cases. But not to use it with 3 d r. That basically significantly reduces scope of the specification, and I'm I I don't think we should do a lot DDR. Other suggestion is, hey, why not restrict that clients which have an out of band agreement with the server. That comply with those claims, they only start, consuming these attributes and Otherwise, they just reject that. I think that also goes against the entire very model that are now piggybacking on and out of band agreement."

I agree with that for the attributes, which can be leveraged by the client for selection, but not for the troubleshooting another kind of attributes, which are just for back and crossing. So, yes, out of band agreement does give me validity that these claims are not false, but yes, you you need to have that mechanism, but not for all the attributes. It's all that I'm saying. Okay. That's a good clarification. In that case, I think that, you know, those other attributes that are not used for client, automated client decision making also don't need authentication in this way. Because they're only useful within closed systems that are not under attack. For instance, if it's a troubleshooting URL, right, I mean, for my for an admin IT admin to look into that URL itself. Right? If it's authentic, it shows it knows that, hey, it's coming from an authentic source, but invalid. It will just discard it. Right? So the authentication is adding a value It's it's, I don't think the attacker is gonna make any profit by misbehaving or changing the information URL troubleshooting purpose. But if you're doing it for the, Yes. He the attacker is not gonna gain much benefits by attacking those, other attributes. Right.

Because you're completely consistent about what the data type, particularly for the error code is a value or a list of values So I would say, and for example, in in the 4th one down, you have, like, a binary. Well, there's no such thing as binary because it's a text. I I would think I would say actually get rid of that second column and actually say in the description that it is, you know, a base and encoded value or it's a comacyprophetic list of decimal values and so forth.

But in the future, that's sure to do that. In the text when we're referring to the constraints around ddr, I just wanted to check because there is a distinction between cases in DVR where we're coming from an address and when we're coming from a name, because there's DDR from name when you already have a name server. You just wanna see what else it supports. And also in DVR between things where we're verifying and potentially ending up with a name that we do trust versus cases where it's just you know, more opportunistic based on the fact that we had the same address being recognized. So I'm wondering in cases Either where there is a name initially, like DNS.google and I'm learning that it does do instead of just dot can I do something better here? Also in cases of, like, you know, quad 8 or quad 1 is what I'm starting with where I learn that it supports encrypted DNS but I also now have a name that's in the certificate along with the public address Does does that let us get something better from resin hardware. Provided that the client goes and validates and check that the name that's there in the cert is again used for the querying the Right. So, like, we could reissue the res we we could issue a res info query for that name. Name, which is in the cert. And then make sure it's in the cert and then we okay. That should work. Great. So as we were are are reworking that language, It it feels like Yes. PDF requests and raw out about DDR.

In the case where You're using name based DDR. It's actually the same as the base case. You start with any other name. Yeah. In the case where you start with an IP address, the name that we end up with is not trustworthy. That was the the security model we decided with on yeah. Yeah. Come back. Because because the IP address is the trustworthy identity that's what we use to so what happens, This really is the Tommy What happens when the local attacker changes the name the service binding response on or 53. The validation for the IP address will succeed are going to DNS dotgoogle. You have this name showing here. It didn't have to validate. And then the client will use it to issue other queries and server won't know any better because you're just asking about some other name. Right. So absolutely correct that for the purposes of DDR for understanding that this is a trustworthy designated resolver What matters is the address matching. And I I'm just wondering. I haven't fully thought cause I was just thinking about this, like, 30 seconds ago, If in this case, we, you know, we start with quantate We get a record that says DNS dotgoogle. We can't trust that. For the purchase of designation. We then connect to that that cert covers quadrate, It also covers data.google. At that point, when we have a cert that matches what was in that and we also trust the designation by address. Can you just issue res info query for DNS got Google to itself."

In, DDR, what we were discussing about that is ish because Lots of services use different names based on what subset of functionality they provide, right, you may have a a straight honest resolver. You might have an ad blocker resolver. You might a filter, whatever. And so if you change that name, and the those servers have different properties, like, say, one's a privacy centric one that does Q And A Minimalization. But the base one doesn't. You can actually change the answer by changing the domain name, even though the IP even though that cert validation will succeed, if they claim like, if you have a less star pattern, for example, But I agree that it's not as egregious as Right. I think it's not necessarily Like, I I I could see that being like a functional issue if someone who is using Resinfo is hosting many different resolvers and confusing people based on it. Essentially. So maybe that's you know, again, a consideration to have in here feels more like a functional recommendation of What to do if you run multiple? Whole servers on one multiple sets of functionality on one server. So, so a question you hear from the chairs. This sounds like there is some real thinking and discussion being had on this particular topic. Do we need people to go sit alone in a room for our wall here this week.

And few other comments that we had received from the working group and all these issues are being tracked in GitHub.

He was he's raised a genuine comment with regard to, how would this be interoperable? What would be the hash algorithms that client and server would implement. So we are relying on the registry that's already there for major edge diocese to 14 s zones. As per the current registry, 3 84 is a must and short for 5 it's a shoot.

And it doesn't matter how many times you fall or redirect chain. And that will give people that throughout all they were looking for. We've taken a dependency on delegated credentials because the idea is there's in the scenario where the server that's doing the redirection does not wanna share its private key with server, it's redirecting to say the CDN case, delegated credentials can solve the problem without having to change names from the client's perspective. And so the text recommends using this with strict origin redirection. It isn't required. But that's the the guidance So the core requirement is you have to support strict origin. Delegated credentials is optional. As a recommendation to implementors to say, if you have that threat model. This is the best solution to that. The alternative a mechanism we're calling overlapping origin redirection. This is what is available if, for whatever reason, you can't use delegated credentials one of the TLS libraries in your client server or third party or redirecting to simply doesn't support it. Rather than being a major blocker you can use this mechanism where through redirection, Every server has to be valid for the domain name that it referred from.

And then on the redirection, you can give the new name the local name, And your fur your first redirection will say will be valid for both where you have these interim servers. And so then you can switch names. Because it's valid for both names. So you can validate based off the original name like you would in strict origin redirection. But then because it succeeded, you can say, and it's valid for this other So now I'll use that as the identity. And now it can be redirecting within that geo even though that's not the name you started And this is something that the implementer can do with the same without having these extra TLS dependencies. This mode is optional. It has a different threat model very obviously. And the text explicitly calls out the limitations on this. And recommends or Remember on the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure we even went so far as to require clients not to use this unless they have for knowledge about it being appropriate for the server.

That way there is a standard answer for those that are in these special cases where delegated credentials isn't available to them, but they still wanna do redirection. We have a standard answer as opposed to everyone doing some proprietary solution or haven't forbid, we have to publish parallel documents. Okay. So for DDR discovered resolvers and thank you to Tommy earlier. Let's be specific that this is about IP discovered DDR Resolveers. The IP address is the identity. We may wanna revisit this after we have our little design discussion, but the current stat, the current take by this draft is that because that's the identity, We support strict origin in this in the sense of the IP address, meaning that Once you establish the encrypted DNS connection and then are redirected the redirected 2 server. Needs to be able to claim the original IP address as well. And that's the equivalent Strict origin. There is no overlapping origin in that case. That kinda makes sense because DDR from IP address is a general public thing.

Because As far as I can tell, the whole point of this is to defeat a set of attacks where then then then upstream attacker is able to execute a DNS cash poisoning attack and and put different SVCB Record into the resolver's cash to activate EDSR when the resolver didn't intend it. And just as with res info, there are a bunch of easier solutions to this. Like, putting that redirection information in a channel that isn't subject to cash poisoning like, edns0.

Well, it's Tommy and Mike. So, I just wanted to point out the similarity in your trust model here to old service and HTTP. Where you get a different name to find the IP address and connect to, but you are still expecting the original authority to appear on the certificate I'm honestly not as interested in having the secondary name also appear on the news pif get, Like, if it points you to another endpoint and says that's also me and it has my Okay. We're done. So the originating scenario behind this that didn't let us do that is the third party relationship, right, you contract that with a CDN. And so the destination actually the final destination through a chain of redirections does not have your private key. Doesn't have the same private key, but it does have the private key for a cert for that name. Correct? The same name. No. I"

So let's say I have 2 names a and b because now I don't wanna remember patterns and and the client was configured through endpoint or whatever else to use server a. Connects to server a. Server a wants to redirect to server b. Different names. It's overloaded. It's been it identified the clients as in a different continent, whatever. And it wants to send it over there because because that entity doesn't have servers of its name control that can take the request at this time, but they have a legal relationship even though they don't have a technical relationship with the destination. Came, Now delegated credentials is the obvious answer to the scenario. And we all agree on which is why it's it's in there as the recommendation. This mechanism was an alternative that we were hoping would make adoption easier for those who don't have that throughout their ecosystem yet. Okay. But I'm waiting for the last sentence of that as of what is the client looking for on that cert when it connects? So, as it goes in each in each iterate iterative step. Anytime if the name matches, all it's looking for is the name, and it's just like Drickton. If it's given a different name, then if it doesn't wanna support this, it'll immediately fail if it does, it checks the destination for both. A and b. And that's why you have to have an intermediate redirection to switch names. Because the destination there has to be valid for a and b. And if it is, and you were told to go to b, then you can make b the current name. And it can redirects to other instances of b as a strictly. I see. That's that's the step I was missing that after you've been to somewhere that is both a and b then you also trust b, and you can redirect to somewhere that is only Yes. Okay. You. Well, that"

If if we have a couple minutes, I I challenge if anyone wants to come to line challenge the validity of the scenario, setting aside the solution, because to Tommy's point, if the scenario is something we wanna tackle, we can work on that together. The scenario where delegated credentials is not end to end feasible but they still wanna be able to do redirection to a contracted third party. Because we can change the solution. That's the scenario we're trying to hit so that is more readily adoptable, and there's one solution that people are using instead of every vendor doing something unique, which is what a big part of what we try to prevent here.

That is just sort of a technical transport change. But, in in this other mode where we're talking to somebody who cannot prove the that they hold the same identity know, in our, sort of abstract terms is really not the same then That's a that's quite a new idea.

I think that know, basically the the resolver could have forwarded our queries to that party anyway. So I'm not too concerned from that angle.

Yeah. Sure. We should definitely check and and then we should also address the if the client is gonna make any decisions based on that, what is the attack factors that could be possible the the the we can do that.

It might be worth thinking of this capabilities flag field rather than having one for each one of these. So instead of having just a delegation service parameters, mandatory, Abe, capability service parameter that's mandatory that lists a set of things with delegation one of them. That might make it more useful in the future. But that would probably be something that would wanna come out of either deep deep go through DNS upper t TLS. It just be used here. Yeah. Okay.
