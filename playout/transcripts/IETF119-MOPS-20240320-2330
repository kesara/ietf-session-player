No. It's At focus, not deck focus. Yeah. But somebody else joining us in the app. They had they could advance the slides themselves too. They would need the quicker. Okay. Welcome to the MOPS session. If you're here for ADD, Don't worry. You are in the right room. But it's an hour before your reading starts. There are pointers at the door. Are you suggesting you close the door? Sure. Thank you So, I'm Leslie Nagel. I am one of the co chairs of Mops. Kyle Rose is with us remotely. And he has a cute cat that we might get to see again. And Glenn Dean is the technical advisor for the group. So so that's us,"

So I'm anticipating we will get through our meeting rather quickly. I would like to thank David Lawrence Tale for, being our meeting scribe. But please, anybody else, feel free to jump into the meeting notes and help contribute as we go. Do note well This is an IITF meeting with the all the IITF policies applying. I think you should be familiar with these by now. But do feel free to take a close read and delve into the ECPs that back them up. I can click. Gosh. By now, since this is Thursday, you know that this session is being recorded. And do make sure this is your reminder to please sign in using the media code light client. And if you do use the, The main client for Mead echo, please do make sure you're not sharing audio and video. I think that's pretty sweet. Forward. Yes. And here are other resources for anything else you wanted to know about this IETF week, Alright. Have an agenda. We have gone through the note well. We've identified our minute taker and, as a moment for any bashes to the agenda. Any batches to the agenda? Not seeing any. So the working group documents updates will be very quick. The media operations use case an extended reality application on edge computing infrastructure document, is now in IETF last call. Thank you, Eric, for pushing it through.

So we were gonna do, update on other IETF work chiefly on the mock work from a media perspective, but this GONE Pro BAF is co is at this time as well, and that's drawing a lot of our regular participants and the folkfolk folk to it. So we weren't able to identify somebody to come talk here. So look for that on the I on the IETF 120 agenda. So with that, we'll scoot right along to the industry updates. So first, I, I think you have these as one presentation, Glenn, so it will be a blended update from the streaming video technology alliance in general. And then a bit of a heads up on some work that's new work that's being done at the SP in terms of looking at the the growth of what what we can call, network application overlays. End. An analysis of the implications and, and ramifications from this growing trend. This is Justin, a heads up about some preliminary work so that you can look forward in the July timeframe to seeing, to seeing a document, from the SPTA outlining what their learnings are about the the the implications of the use of these technologies in streaming video. So that will be an interesting discussion then. So long story short, today is not the day for the fun fight. This is a heads up. And with that, When? When? When?"

For those of you for the UK, also Sky. So you know, we're we're we, cover a lot of video and we cover a lot of networking in my day job. And, I'm also part of the Studio Media Technology Alliance I chair the number key to transport working group over there. I'm the technical adviser of Mops. And, you know, Mops meet a, operations group of the things we try to do here is to make sure that the industry is connected back into the TF and vice versa. So while I come over here and talk often about SVTA updates or sometimes, Sanjay Bistra. We'll also come and talk about these things who does CDNI stuff. We also go over there when we talked about those guys, what's going on in the IT, you have to keep everybody in sync. So, Highlands from 2023, SVT did a lot of things. We put on every year a a big segments conference. In fact, that just happened if you, missed it. It was in Denver in February. And we did it back to back this year with Mile High Video. And so, it works really well. Is it really good conference? A lot of good participation. Segments is an external conference. So if you wanna talk about video and stuff like that, look for a segment's 2025. Don't know where it's gonna be yet, but it'll probably be in the springtime. And may or may I be be co located with my high video? We'll see. But it's part of the ongoing operations are are we segments is operationally focused on video. So a lot of ways to think about what SVTA does is we're sort of like the Danog or that operations"

We either deal with it in there or we bring it back to the AGF. And we do a lot of documents. We've also updated our document numbering scheme. That way you're now referring to us online, you won't have to have a URL got 5,000,000 characters. It started out like a really simple thing. Like, hey, let's create a numbering scheme for documents. And, as we all know from the ICF, that isn't so simple. So, let me talk to you then about the big meaty thing for today. This is a thing that has been discussed, at the, SVTA, we have the a meeting, the week before IETF did Prague. We were SVTA net in prague as well. We started the conversation where people started saying, we're finding operational impacts that are being caused by, these overlay networks. An example of an overlay network would be Apple Private Relay. It's Things that it's doing are causing some operational impacts to CDMs and video service delivery. And and we're all trying to say that's a terrible service. Trying to say there's some technical choices made there impacts some other technical choices made on the other place I'm gonna go through a little bit that today and give you a taste. For the purpose of it, what the SVT is doing is we're having a discussion within that group about trying to catalog in and capture in a document all the various impacts. Now as I go through these, you'll get a taste of some of them. trying to capture that. So then, ultimately, we're gonna come back either to the IETF probably for Vancouver and say, is a new document operational concerns we have, could we please engage with everybody here to talk through them and find out if there's new things we can do new specifications, changes we could make, or other things, either in SBCA or IETF or both. To make everybody work really nicely together."

    "text": "So at the heart of all the the the conflict or the problems we're surrogacy is that policies are changed on network overlays, right? So And I'll show you a picture in the middle of a counterpulse we're impacting, but overall, It's the selection and the changing out of policies, whether it's a routing policy change or a DNS policy change where we swap out the DNS or other things that ironically that fight true up against, for talking about this, against another boss that's talking about secure network policy distribution although out of slightly different topic in a slightly different way, We're, you know, we're both talking about network policies and their impact of video delivery and how we could make the applications and the video delivery service aware and understanding of the network policies and the changes that come along with them in particular when network overlays, are present in the delivery path. And so, you know, as I said, routing changes are things that are starting to pop up and cause trouble. Protocol changes, where we, you know, transfer, if you say, I'm, you used to be coming for HTTP 2, I'm gonna read you an HTTP 3 and maybe fix you up later on. That can cause some problems. DNS changes where we, you know, you're using DNS for directing clients successfully to better cash selection you suddenly come through an overlay and that information gets lost, that becomes a problem. And then address changes. If you go look at there's a spec on that's being jointly developed between SVTA and CTA on tokens for tracking and managing sessions across different CDN instances. In that spec, they use a geohashed IP address as an identifier. Works really well when you're just on the regular internet. But now if I've come through a overlay network, has changed the address space for those clients and then itself is also using a cached IP address mapping, start getting some conflicts. The kind of conflicts we might have seen years ago"

Example address too for your DNS, not just before. The hardest on the slide, but I agree with you. It's a good comment, Bob. As you know, I'm a strong supporter of V Six. But they they're hard to fit on a slide. So what it was Here's a very simple example of the kind of overlay scenario we're talking about. In this case, we have an application the up, protocol HTTP. That is being routed through a different routing policy than all of the other protocols on that same network from the perspective of the client. This is causing some obvious cash fluctuation problems potentially. It also causes problems where, and this is increasingly true in the professional media space. We care a lot about latency. We are spending lots of time and energy right now figuring ways to measure latency. And and not just end to end latency. It's and land latency plus everything in between that suddenly causes latency to go up imagine you're watching a massive, sporting event like there was an NFL game that was streamed on Peacock in the United States recently. We really care about the latency from all the clients to these, CDN servers that are delivering that content. Things get in the way, That's a problem. And when our tools for measuring latency no longer follow the path, that the application will be taking for the video service We have a problem. Our tools are broken. They don't. In this case, you'll you'll follow the golden line there. That's the flow that the video traffic walks you take. If it's on a, this particular overlay network. But if knows up top, ICMP and trace route and other things like that follow a completely different path."

    "text": "So very common latency measurement tools no longer work in this workflow. That's a problem. I don't have a solution today, by the way. I'm just I'm I'm just up here telling you guys all the homes we're finding. The other problem we have too is very often these network overlays are invisible to the application. They will turn on and the application doesn't get notified, oh, you're in this environment. Now, a lot of people say, well, it's not really a problem. Well, think about it from the application standpoint. If I'm application developer, I wanna know what path my content's gonna take. Well, I may use ICMP. Or I may use a pain, right, with ICP again. Made you a trade spot. I may do other things to find that path. And they're gonna say, Oh, you're going this way. When you actually start doing the video flow, you're gonna go on a different This is again an example of the tools aren't keeping up sometimes some of the more advanced networking choices that we're making. And here's, the cash selection problem highlighted. So on the bottom, corner on the bottom left hand side, you have two versions of the same application. One is doing video streaming, using HTTP. One is using video streaming using HTTPS. If I'm in an environment which only flows HTTP over an overlay, Then I'm gonna fall that red line you see I'm gonna go up. I'm gonna ingest it. This is a mask relay that I'm illustrating here. It goes up, gets ingested, gets unwrapped, comes back down. I'm gonna hit the The transit is gonna eventually go on the open transit And I'm gonna get the DNS or, sorry, the the CDN cache that's on the open internet. Same video service also has a video cache on the access network. That's really what I wanna hear because it's giving me the fast one, right? The the blue line, the blue float, where if I'm doing HTTPS, HTTPS in this particular overlay, which is Apple Private Relay's behavior, is not gonna flow up into the apple free framework gonna flow into the, network. It's gonna say, oh, we've got a hedge right here. Is gonna connect me on the cash. So here's a difference in behavior. On if the URL contains HTTP. Or HTTPS"

    "text": "I get very different behaviors of what cash is ultimately gets selected. And that can be for a couple of reasons. It could be a running policy change. It could be that the DNS and the overlay network doesn't support EDNS 0. If my application and my workflows are ready to use the EDS 0 for cash selection, A lot of the, like, cloud flow, for instance, doesn't support EDNS 0 information. For cash directions. So that that binder change has a big change implication to the video flow and and the delivery path. And Likewise, even at the application level, it doesn't know what's going on. So if it tries to be tasked and tries to figure out doesn't always get the right answer. So this then caused the problem of what cash do I get and what are my what's my latency? My performance to it. Now a lot of people say when we use these overlays for for, privacy reasons and that's a good cause. In this case, though, it is the same user same account, ultimately going to the same video cache to a service that it actually has a login with Right? So the cash on each side knows who it's talking to So other than the the network paths taken, as you get the exact same result. And on the bottom, it's htps and it's quick. So quick is doing the security and the privacy part right there. If you're on the network, you try to poke in and see what the guy's watching. You can't. Quicken's already taken care of that. So it's not a big privacy issue necessarily. But it is a performance and is a latency issue. Any questions on this? Anybody wanna come up and tell me I'm wrong? Because we're seeing this in the in the wild and it's causing some real problems. So, next steps, what are we gonna do about found a problem, we found a series of problems, gonna document them. We're gonna tease them out, put them in a document so that people can understand where we could have a, growing up engineering, engineer conversation about what the impacts are. There's a partial list of the stuff we've already identified that is a problem. Probably gonna be more as we tease it out. Then we're gonna come back to the IETF and say,"

I'm I'm used to getting yelled at. So somebody needs to get up to a microphone and yell at about something, but I got wrong. Any any questions about what Glenn has presented and or any thoughts about other areas that should be explored in this vein? Hi. Tasha Saida. So I think you don't care much about ICN, but I'd be revising operators ever seen. Yes. a a non ICN environment. This is Primarily at HTTP streamed, using manifests. Is the delivery path that we're worried about here. Okay. So you don't hear so much about a different approach So you definitely do want to use that. Okay. Correct. We we have 100 of millions of clients deployed already, whole industry based around this current technology flow. And I know ICN does offer some unique features the cats out of the bag now. They're firmly entrenched in HDP as a delivery path. And just a side note, thank you, Eric, and George, for using the Q tool. So people who would like to, it not a problem. But just going forward, if anybody would like to speak, please do put yourself in queue. Thanks. Okay. Irrigving the responsibility for mops, I think this document should at least be presented in mops I say at least because maybe it should be presented in other areas as well. Is about media operation, like, clearly. And We know each other in the ITS, so we will make sure that we announced this draft as well to the relevant people.

You wanna become a member, can make that happen too. George Michaelson, AP Nick. So I really like. This talk, and I think that you are talking about real problems, But I think that this will be a cross working group conversation because this is almost identical to things that arose naturally with IP and IP of any kind. So any tunnel exposing protocol any overlay fabric VPNs, global VPNs, selection CDN under VPN termination address, how do you expose the true address ECSE. Client subnet marking in DNS, it goes into so many working groups that I don't think it's going to have a simple home. And purely from my own personal perspective, and in no sense to say don't do this, I think it will be extremely hard to terminate this And the primary reason is because nobody actually knows how to talk about policy in a way which rationally terminates because you need languages and meta languages to describe the infinity of policy capabilities but you can't actually nail them down. To the small set that rationally suit the use case. So I do think this is good work. And I really liked your presentation. But dot and I think you're right. I think the challenge here is not to boil the ocean. And that's why narrowing it down to focus on a couple of the very specific things such a CD and cash selection and that space. It's probably the easy solution path here. Just just just just just there is so much here. You know, and and I wanna be clear. We're not trying to undo the privacy initiatives that the IETF has spent the last what, 10 years developing. Just trying to make sure that the workflows for other stuff work with them. So that's it.
