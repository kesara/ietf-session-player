I think that the showing revised ID initiative there was an AD review of those from Gunther. So if you have a of them at the top there. I think that the showing revised ID needed. There was an AD review of those from Gunter. So if you have any outstanding issues with any of those trials think that the showing revised ID needed. There was an AD review of those from Gunther. So if you have any out, if there are any outstanding issues with any of those drafts, please respond on the list to that review and address those comments so that we can move forward as soon as possible the extent mobility procedures for EPP and IRB is in Gantos Q the EVPN multi-homing extensions for split to horizon filtering is in IESG review which I think means it's gone past Gunter and it's now sitting waiting for broader IESG review"

So, we are, I'm just running currently a short working group last call just to reconfirm the change of status of the document, and then we will likely move that forward.

So layer three routes like EVPN Route 5 or IPVP routes. But here we are using it for EVPN layer two routes. And by that, I mean MAC IP routes AED per EVI routes for VPWS services and also inclusive multi-gas routes The main goal, is to avoid loops on the data center gateways, on the service gateways when you interconnect EVPN domains and also to have better traceability and best path selection the in the examples that you have here is basically very quickly if you advertise a Mac IP route, for instance, if you look at the upper diagram, you advertise it, you receive it on Gateway 1 and 2, and they exchange that MAC route between each other, and they add the D path attribute with the identifier of the domain of origin, and based on that, they can gateway one will identify the route as looped and will not redistribute the route back into the original domain so that's for a loop protection the same way that you have here for Mac IP routes, we can do it for 80 per EVI routes in the case of interconnecting domains for VPWS services. And you have another example here for traceability but basically what that means is the if you have redundant gateways and you you get on gateway three, if you look at the bottom on diagram, you get MAC IP routes for the"

You can actually see the domain path attribute and based on that make a decision You know exactly the domains through which the route has gone and you can do the best paths selection. For Macau, routes, I already mentioned some of this maybe is something important to highlight is that this is a complete compatible with the interconnected Ethernet section in RFC 9014 so no matter what domain path activity you receive on the routes, if they are coming with an ESI that you have a locally configured, you're not going to redistribute the route back into the original domain You can also use the D-Path for fast convergence in the sense that on the right-hand side of the slide, you have an example, a gateway 1, when it receives the route for Gateway 2, it will not install it It will detect it as a looped route because it gets a route directly from PE1 But if for some reason that route from PE1 disappears, it can now install the route and you forward the in-flight packets to the other gateway. We can also use the path for inclusive multicast routes when you have gateways typically you exchange IMET routes on the two domains and they create a parallel paths for bump traffic So you really want to avoid that and you can use D-path to select which one to pick Okay, so changes with made recently in this revision.

There are two rules in section 4-1, and the second rule basically was not clear. The second rule says that the routes within numerically lowest, left-most domain ID are preferred but we had to clarify what that meant and that's what we did The second change is basically we needed to add some warning text to basically bring awareness that if you have an inconsistent environment if you have some gayways that are not upgraded and some others are, you may have inconsistent best path selection, which is not good so that's why we added some text in section four and also in the security considerations section It is worth noting that we believe, the authors believe, that this is more controlled environment It's not like in the layer three case where you can actually have attribute escape and you can actually send it to the seas and to the internet and all that. This is more for layer two which is always a more controlled world garden you know, environment. So we even though we we don't think it's an issue it's always good to add additional text to warn the reader reader Another thing that we discussed with Jeff So not moving on No. Oh, there you go.

Of course, the four first routes they only apply to mac IP routes and not to 80 previous routes or I made route because they refer to extend the communities that are on allowed with Mac IP routes But the important thing is rule number six here says that the shortest D path is preferred, so when you're comparing routes And rule number seven says that the lowest leftmost D-path domain ID is preferred, right? So we added the rule number seven based on feedback that we received that basically in this kind of environments, we needed something more tools to influence the Vespas selection for these routes, right? That's the reason why it is here. So I just wanted to make sure that people reads and understands that this rule is also there And other than that, please read and provide feedback so that the document can get ready for working group last call Any questions? Thank you, Peter, Arcus I, two points. I think you are trying to avoid loop two detections across the gateway so that you may, you want to carry essentially what layer 3 VPN do with site of origin. Is that something, is that a good analysis? Because there is enough loop detection built inside BGP, otherwise to track all the loops Yeah, so when you have returned gateways in between EVP and domains, we want to avoid loop protection.

Well, there's see the gayways when they re-advertised when a JSON adjacent domain, they are adding this attribute with the identifier of this source domain. That's what I meant, yeah And that's very analogous to site of origin. Otherwise, you really don't know to carry this information so i'm quite curious as to how you decided to come up with a new attribute while layer 3 VPNs have some ways of doing it That's number one. And you can think about this and we can discuss offline or you can send me something I can send it on the mailing list. Number two is that can you go back to that slide which the rules that you modified Sorry, I know that's not working and I apologize for making. Which slide? Yep, there. Stay there One more. One more No. Forward side yes one there stay there one no no no the first one the rules I mean the last slide yeah I mean, the last slide. This is why the dice tracker recommends that you number your slides. Thank you Oh The second last slide The second last slide. Oh, okay This one? I think so So what happens when you have two paths with one path? that doesn't have a D path? Let's say the gateway stripped it off Does the rule set needs to be modified? to say always choose a path with D path? as opposed to a path without D-path? Yeah so that's covered in the document. Basically, no D-Path means the length is zero So if you get one route with D-Path and another one without you pick the one without because the length is zero. Oh wow. You hit a- But if someone, that means if someone accidentally strips off D-path,"

All I'm suggesting is you may want to think about that and always because you've added a rule which probably makes a lot more sense that says, hey, choose the short SD path Yeah, but I would also recommend you to look at the other draft, the original draft, which is the APP IPVPN Interworking draft that we beat to there with Jeff and Sue, and we went through all these things and sure I mean, there are rules for that and with this and we went through all all these things and and sure I mean there are rules for for that and we discuss all those things but if you if you still think that there are considerations that we we need to add to this drive sure let's discuss thank you I'll see it out to the list. Okay, Jeff is next to Nicky Yeah, thanks. So to respond the care for the homework that he's missed the motivation for things is not quite the same as site of origin for re-import to the originate site. Kier, this is because this mechanism is used because things are going from one technology, L3PN to IVPPP back and forth and therefore you need the D-Path to have these same behavior that a reflector would put on with a cluster list. So this is a solving the problem in a very cluster list-like fashion that would otherwise be lost, site of origin is not sufficient for this The length rules that you see here are very similar to the ones that we have a route reflection for exactly the same reason and the cases you're concerned about are covered Thank you Thank you.

And in the cut cut-through mode, that is not going to work because cut-through needs to be able to process it one chunk at a time as it goes through the pipeline pipeline So the proposal in here is basic to introduce a shim header right after the ESP header You can think of it as an extended ESP header, but I didn't want it to call it extended ESP header to, to have issues with the IPSEC in me. This is just the SHIM header, follow the ESB and we keep the ESP intact And the UDP port, instead of saying this is ESP, what follows is ESP ESB and we keep the ESP intact and the UDP port instead of saying this is ESP, what follows is a ESP, the UDP port number is going to say what follows is this ESP plus shimhead"

With the length field, 16 bit of length field and 16 bit of protocol type so that is basically in a nutshell that what these cut through frame format looks like and we're going to be adding a tunnel type to the BGP signaling to indicate that this is going to be the this is going to be the ESB plushim header frank format and making sure that the PE's understand this and if they don't understand them that they don't need to process this So that's it This is not, is it other battery or?

Yeah, I'm going to solicit the input from the IP segment, but this is, we're keeping everything in the IPSEC intact And that's why I laid out that way that you need just a shit SHIM header and both the ESP and the SHIM is going to be in open I mean, it's not going to get encrypted. And it's not going to impact any of the IPSEC fidelity and procedure. That's right. Yes Yesterday there was similar discussion there. Just suggest you maybe discussed over there.

Just that particular section section four, because people here may not have the expertise on the key management The key, well, no, that we're going to keep it intact because it's true you know, it talks, it covers what we need the key management and the re-key, if you look at that section, is a function of the point to multi-point BGP signaling so you cannot take it out and say, I'm going to discuss it separately because it's tied to that point-to-multipoint BGP signaling.

And even though it is implicitly on understood, how to do it, I felt that it is a good idea to add a couple of sentences to cover this.

So we put added these a couple of sentences to clarify how we do the on-tag user data traffic treatment so there is no ambiguity ambiguity Go ahead The addition, what you write here in about section 6 to 1 is fine of course, regarding section 6.3 I have some doubts because normally the normal the handling of intact traffic in the I3 place standards suggest that they added to this, such traffic is supported to be added to the same table a bridge table as defined by the port bay port villain for the port from which it has received So I'm not sure you need an additional bridge table. So we have an additional for the port mode in this Yeah, but so it depends how you want to define that port mode, okay? You can just simply say, port mode is only for the, it means I don't have any visibility to the VLens and I'm transparent to the VLAN and that becomes 6 to one.

Default villain Everything that goes on-tank goes into the default. This is the same thing. But it is not not which means that it is not an additional breach that into the default. This is the same thing. But it is not, not, which means that it is not an additional breach table. It's the same bridge table? No, it is an additional because the default VLAN is his own villa is has his own bridge table Yeah, but if you receive, let me ask it like this, if you receive two frames one which is entire, in the case of a port base service one frame is untucked and the other frame is tucked with the port-based villain. Should you send? them to the same bridge table or to two different bridge tables? so typically you don't get that, for the default wheel and you don't get the tag traffic which has a default wheel. Okay So you get the you get two wheel and you get the two frames, one with the VLAN 100 one on tag.

Also, since our 7432 came out, there have been quite a number of new route types and they're all spread across many different rFC or drafts.

No, because all those route types have already gone through the bin registered as part of the INA and their being described in their corresponding draft So there is no point in the list of all the routes in here if you are not covering them. If you're going to include all those route types, then we need to include the procedures for it and that means now we have to consolidate tons of draft together, which is not the intention in here thank you and just one last comment is the is there a change, maybe a change log? that kind of has changes from the original to this wrap that kind of lists like all the changes.

We know that EVPN for the overlay, it handles both V4 and V6 right from daily one.

So we don't have to upgrade the control playing session in order to migrate the data plane to the V6 And we want to also be able to revert either during this process or at the end of the process So, basic to do that, we are saying that we need to enable the dualist stack in the underlay and both PE and P.N.P.

So we confirm the next we configure the both we configure V6 IP address in addition to the V4 for EVP and VXLAN operation and once we do that then the VTEP one PE1 advertises is EVPN routes with VCP with this secondary V6 address, and the secondary V6 address gets advertised in the BGP Tunnel and Capp address"

No, I want to carry the second address for the V6 BGP Next Hub for the NRI doesn't allow that there is, they can be only a single BGP next up. You cannot have two And then the other option is BGP the other option is the BGP next hop attribute, not the BGP next hop attribute of the NROI attribute, but BGP NextHop attribute and that attribute only supports IPV4 and not IPVV6 So then the third choice which is reasonable, is to use the attribute that allows for that And we are basically consistent.

So everybody can consistently build that order list No, I know everyone will build the candidate list. What I mean is if you change that IP from a V4 to a V6, that changes the order of the P itself. So what I'm saying is that there is not you change that IP from a V4 to a V6, that changes the order of the P itself. So what I'm saying is that there is nothing wrong with it, but it has to be reflected somehow. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the other comment is So that's a good point That, uh, okay. Yeah, the other thing is in an NFC NFC-85-84, we have this ACDF influence DF election, which is the capability. You can prune the candidate list based on the reception of the 80 routes but the 80 routes can only be I identified based on the next hub, as you know so if you use in the ES route you use a you know a v4 address and the AD routes, you use a V6 address. There's no way you can correlate them together, right? So that has to be reflected as well in the traffic that's a good point so if you can, like a sentence email with respect to these two points.

And actually, we get this draft, we have another draft kind of like a base draft which aims to provide a Oh, Ja mechanism to validate different kinds of SS SRV6 SRV-6-SRV6-related information, but we want to find some more specific and strong use cases, and thanks to Matthew during last IETF mentioning the work in Bands on my NPS connectivity check So we write this draft dedicated for SRVC DVP, based on the similar similar and requirements. So you can check both draft if you are entrusted and welcome feedback"

One aspect is the technology-specific encoding, which is really the best, but there's another aspect where the verification and response messages are defined, and those are the base ICMP and messages And that work, it needs to be done in six men or interior that's one comment that I'd like to make Oh, thanks a fact. Yes, sure So why we so first why we want to present this confess is and other related working groups because first we want to find some use cases So we actually want to introduce some LCP like structure for SRV6 So if these requirements are agreed, for example, on banks, then we can go to six minutes these requirements are agreed on, for example, on banks, then we can go to six men for the details for the extending details So on how we can do this So, yeah Jorge Fronoquian Thanks for the presentation.

Oh, so what? go double check about that PPP in Zimbab Park So maybe I, I write a wrong example So in our draft, we have the EVVM Connected DHS part So I double check if it's not right, I'll leave out the P will have the unique connectivity check part. So I double check if it's not right, I'll leave out the PPP mean part. Thank you Okay, I'll just say, maybe I can answer Jorge's question I think the reason PBVPN is mentioned here is because this draft is written based on RFC 9489 and which is MPLS based on MPLS covers both EVPN and PPPVPN, and then that's where the PBB EVPN got into SRV6, which it shouldn't okay, which it shouldn't. But my comments is, basically following what zafar mentioned earlier The way I look at it, there are two parts. One is the con with respect to this OEM verification. One is the container and then one is the context of that container okay? The container in case of the MPLS transport, we have echo request and echo response in case of the IPV6 or SRVC, we have validation requests and validation response"

And the container needs to be there, but that's very small portion That's like, I would say, 5% of the percent of the, if you want to write a draft, that's five percent And a container needs to be there, but that's very a small portion. That's like, I would say, 5% of the, if you want to write a draft, that's 5% of it. 95% is the contents of that container which is being defined in the RFC-9489 of that container, which is being defined in the RFC in 9489. And I would say that that context, unless somebody comes and says, we need, you know, this sub-tlV and these contents that are defined in that RFC is not applicable to SRVC or is not applicable to vxlan or whatever. If somebody can just, you know, say that then we should keep it in one place And we should basically have a small section to cover different transport One transport is already covered is MPLS. The second transport can be SRV6, the third transport that is needed is VXRN. We need to have this procedure for VXV as well. So I would like to keep the whole thing in one place. Maybe we write a ROT errata that we need to cover it for RFC 9489 needs to cover other transport and then extend that RFC with a small section for this transport. But as we talked that for the IPV6 transport, we need the work, first will be done in the ICMP we need the work first will be done in the for the ICMP so that needs to be done once that is done you know, extending putting the context and putting the sub-tlv in it, that I think is a cookie cutter So that's my, uh, that's my comment.

Okay thank you So it works Roba then So this draft is basically about a issue that we found in RFC 9-2 this draft is basically about an issue that we found in RFC 9251, and yeah, we wanted to bring awareness I don't know how serious the issue is, but at least it deserves people's attention people's attention I'm gonna talk about the issue itself, potential solutions, and next steps So the specific issue that we found in NADFC 9-2 is the procedures with the multicast leave procedure itself so IFC9251 basically so solves the issue of synchronizing the leaf stage when you have multi-homing you know, in two or more PEs So what you have at the upper part of the slide is the issue itself. It's basically a short refresh of the issue is if you have a C C.E. That is attached to this, all active multi-homing etherness segment and the non-DF is PE1 it may send a leave message to P2 P2 initiates the maximum response time procedures and all that. It sends the last member query But the response to that last member query, can actually be hashed to the other P to P1. And if that happens basically P last member query but the uh response to that last member query can actually be hashed to the other p to p e1 and if that happens basically p2 will never realize that it's still in interest on that multicast group So RFC9251 resolves the issue, but adding a new eVPN route type which is type 8, and basically in the same situation, if you look at the bottom side of this slide when we receive the leaf on P2, now we"

So if it receives that join in step number four if it receives that join before the timer expires, basically it sends a multicast report saying route and p2 will know that there is still interest. Okay, so that's the whole thing So what is the issue here? The issue is really three issues let's put it this way The first one is there are different interpretations of what the max response time encoded in the route is, right? So if you look at sections 6-2, at least for us, it's not clear what that maximum response time is in the route could be the last member query interval times last member query count, or it might be the maximum response time which is matching the group specific queries, the specific field itself. So our interpretation when we implemented this is that it is actually the last member query interval times last member queries can count. But maybe you have a different interpretation. So it would be nice to discuss it. The second issue is you know there are some cases where you cannot encode, uh, so the protocols IGMP, V2B3, M V3, MLD, V2, they actually can support values for this maximum response time that are actually larger than what you can encode in the route itself, right? And that is specifically an issue on IGMPV-3 or MLD V2, where the the"

    "text": "actual max response time in the in the equation it comes with a flow the actual max response time in the in the in the queries it comes with a floating point format so you can actually have exponential values and I can go really high So in those values you cannot encode them into the max response time in the route type 8 So the question is what do you do if you know if someone configures really, really large values, right? So we need to somehow say what to do. And the third issue is the RFC talks about this delta time that PE2 needs to account when it starts the timer, the local timer basically to compute also the time that it gets for the leaf route to get to the other piece in the Ethernet segment, the PGP propagation time right? That is sometimes not easy to, if you configure it managed it's not easy to figure out how long that timer has to be, right? So, and that may lead to premature removal of state and turn. So we have those two issues. There are different ways to address them but basically what we want is to address them somewhere and somehow For issue number one and two, we need to say what happens? what exactly we encode in Route Type 8 And if we have a larger value in the local protocol we need to say what to do, right? The draft talks about some potential solutions for that. The solution for ratio number three is we can actually instead of configuring the delta time for the BGP propagation, we could actually use this timestamp extend the community that we are already using at the fast DF recovery draft And if you add that time stamping, to the route you don't really need to configure any fixed, you know, time"

And there are different ways to fix this So one way is to keep with this short draft and that we can you know, it can end up updating RFC90 Another way is to create a BIS draft for the RFC-9251 We are really open to, you know, to discuss the different options. So please read the draft and provide feedback about what existing implement do and and based on that we can continue the discussions with the big authors and see how we address this okay questions yeah I think Mancamano was first but the can go if you're okay Yeah, go ahead, Ali. Okay First, all right, thank you for this draft. I think we need to these things to be addressed in order for the interoperability to work. So thank you for that. And these needs to be addressed. Question, as you mentioned, where to ask address it? And my take on it is if the changes are small, then it makes sense to incorporate it into the 90 to 51 B base. But if the changes are significant and big and we have to write more multiple pages then it justifies his own trip so thank you okay thanks Mankhamala Yes. So I think the so there are two parts, what the solution could be and the second part is how exactly we are doing. Sorry, can you speak first? to the mic? You can't, I'm here. Oh, you can't hear me?"

Yeah, we'll see first part is what exactly the solution which we are going to use. And one of the points, if we look at maximum response time I think when the IGMP original RFC was defined, it was mainly for land kind of situation This involves a lot of timers. I would, I think I did speak to Jorge that can we do in a way where both of the peer they actually configure manually and we don't really rely on all these mechanisms of transport time because it is going to add extra overhead with risk actually configure manually and we don't really rely on all these mechanisms of transport time because it is going to add extra overhead with respect to implementation when I say overhead it is complete and as he pointed out depending on how long bgp is taking to deliver the routes, leave sync route there are chances where either we may premature delete something or maybe we will have extra traffic. So that is one point to consider I'll definitely send it mail over for the working group as well so that other people can chime in and see that what kind of solution we would like to do before we decide on how to do, whether it is new draft or this Okay. Sounds good. Thank you I want to add that, so I've learned one input implementation. It actually does not use the maximum risk response time in the message. It's just simply do a last member query on its own Yes, that's how our implementation"

Sorry, there's one before that, one before that So just a few updates I wanted to give today So I have added a section on SRI So that's the SRV6 compression, C-fit applicant bill to the VPN overlay stitching so applicability of that to this draft, so a session on that I've also added, so there was a discussion on mailing list on the Bez mailing list that Jorge had sent. And it was a really interesting thread that started, but it was related to adding support for type Saffy for the BGP Yang model which is in there and then how to do that So when that was brought up, I actually was started to research that, just the idea of type safeties versus non-type safeties. And then the applicability of type safes So with this draft, all Saffees are supported and that's what I kind of have in this draft that would support but there are some caveats with certain Saffies. So type Saffirs they're actually, you know, from we researching this they appear to be not applicable And then I have a slide that kind of goes into that So also I have an update on text testing"

Cisco, hopefully we're planning to complete soon Huawei, we're getting you to get an ETA on completion. And then ERISA, we haven't made any progress, so we're going to remove ERISA from the draft. Next slide So here's just details on the status of testing. So Juniper is 100 Nokia is 100%. And then really Cisco is the only is in the third one that we're waiting on. We'll see what status we have on Huawei But I think once Cisco is completed, I think we'll be ready for Work Group last call. Next slide So this one I wanted to talk about a little bit more in detail. So the concept, so there were five FAFEs and I went through all the staffies that exist today, and just to see if there weren't any missing So from Jorge's email that he had related to the BGP Yang model, there were, so we have MCAP's VPN EVPN and BGPN VPLS, EVPN and BGPLS and then CAR. So there's those are the really the five Safi types NLRI that use the concept of types. So when you're using the concept of types and then how that relates to this draft is that we you have a type safi, basically the type, because you have a right tie, and then the data field is actually not in it's not it's not it's not it's not carried directly in the in the nLRI it's part of a data field except you know enclosed underneath the route type. What ends up happening is let's say if you have IPV4 and IPV6 NLR that is, that is part of the, that's in the data field, you know, underneath the route type. So what that does, it kind of makes, it makes those route types that are type safy, it makes them data plan agnostic"

So when you do that, it allows you to eliminate having that other address space, so the other protocols. So if it's a V6 peer and it's a V6 peering, IPV6 only P that, it allows you to eliminate having that other address space, so the other protocols. So if it's a V6 peer, it's a V6 peering, IPV6 only PE, you don't have a V4 address. And similarly, if it's the IPV4 only PE, you don't have a V6 address. So that, so it's got that data plane construct but when you have a type Safi, because it's type and you have the data the data the data carried in a separate is it's carried underneath the under not directly in the NLR as it's typed and you have the data, the data is carried in a separate, it's carried underneath the NLR, not directly in the NLR, and a good example is, let's say, L3 VPN It's in, it's carried directly, so then it's because it's carried directly in, in the NLRI and not in and not, and not a underneath the route type it's definitely, it's data play dependent And because of that, that really makes these staffies not not applicable to that be for only PE or the IPV6 only PE. So that is an update that I'm I'm planning to do after after this call just wanted to review that with the work group to see if anyone has any comments or questions on that but that's that's a big update so I'll have that updated hopefully within the next day or so Next slide so this this next update is related to SRVC compression and just the applicability of that so in this in this draft we've been working individually with each of the vendors doing their testing on the IP only PE design and the IPV6 only with the single V4 peer, single V6 peer.

And so with that, there's four basically test cases that we're going to add to our testing. One is with Global Table, and it's the inner AS piece when we're doing inter-AAS P-E-to-Pering One is where SRV-6 has enabled on the P-E's and then a second and this is with Global Table and then another one is where you're using that we're the P-2-P-E peering, SRV-6 is just disabled, but here you're using the IP data plane to stitch. And that's one of the benefits of C-SR is that you don't necessarily have to have SRV6 enabled on everything node. And there could be portions of the network, especially even like the inter-domain ties, they can be IP just it could be just a vanilla IP data plane so the global table with IPV6 disabled and then the VPN is a test number three is SRV6 enabled on the inner ASPers but then we here we have SRV6 enabled, and then we do the same test with SRV6 disabled and that's where we're doing just the IP data plane is is stitching the VPN overlay Next slide. So we're planning to finish off testing. It's been a long road I think that we've been, I think, three or four years in the works, but we planning to finish off testing. It's been a long road. I think that we've been, I think, three or four years in the works, but we're hoping to be finished this fall and then we'll plan for work group last call Thank you Any comments?"
