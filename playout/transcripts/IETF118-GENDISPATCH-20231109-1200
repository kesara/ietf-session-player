So, I wanted to give you a bit of an example the sort of pattern that I see in in documents. And this is, this is a document that I wrote a number of years ago. And you will see from the sort of chart here that's taken from the data tracker there is a very specific cadence of updates. And it might just be that those, those, lines between 1, 2, 3, 45. Or exactly on 6 months intervals. And then the update, right, sort of slowed down. Turns out that that was updating the document. Because I was just updating the document. Was just feeding the machine. And, if you look at the diffs between some of these versions there are changes in some of them. And some of them are very, very minor. Ultimately, that document was published. Because the information and that was considered useful by community, Next slide, please. So exploration. If the draft has expired, it's not irrelevant or stale. We find that RFCs often cite internet drafts Relevance might be correlated with age, but, documents can go bad in less than a day. I've had that happen. But also they can stay fresh for many, many years. And I routinely cite internet drafts that have never been published. In various conversations. It doesn't have anything to do with the abandonment. State. On a document.

So the the proposal is to sort of remove it, trim a little bit of boilerplate out of the documents. Doesn't match practice. We keep these documents. And also, to realize one of the major pieces of feedback that I received on the 1st iteration of this document was that, the expiration date sort of helps us focus attention and, and, So, well, an expired draft is not one that we'll be talking about. I don't find that chairs have any trouble understanding what is and what isn't relevant for discussion and working group sessions. And so, think that this really only encourages countless busy work. Next slide, please. So, Shouldn't be necessary, but, reminders about, documents being, needing replacement or updates, is something that people have identified as being useful. As part of our process, but, we have other ways of able to provide for those sorts of capabilities. Draft suggests something, I'm not particularly wedded to it, the idea that if you had a document updated before the previous session, And it hasn't been updated just in advance. If the current session, you might send someone a a reminder. So rather than getting this sort of this drip of your documents expiring, you would get, an email a couple of weeks ahead of the IETF meeting saying, following documents, were updated before the last IHS meeting.

It's always been possible for the the chairs of working group to ask for tombstone documents to be produced. Speaking as a chair who does not get niggled to do that. I have almost never actually asked the document author to produce one. And we could actually take this forward into much better signals than this as has been pointed out, has ceased to be an effective signal since we no longer actually delete the drafts when they're expired.

On on that point of better tools, think to tombstone are often more work than people are willing to invest at that time. Do have the ability to mark drafts as dead.

Life Sacred, not not speaking as AD, but as an individual, historically, right, there was very limited things, the data tracker and other pieces of the, tooling we had could do. And so, this is sort of a clue that was used way back when, and it overlays a whole bunch of different things in into this one little tag. For example, at the time right up. RF season and a draft were a lot more, frequently referenced by academic work and there should be a signal that, you know, this thing isn't something you should put into your sick home paper. For example. Right? And also that's that's where, as you know, must not be referred to as anything other than work in progress, bit comes from but I think sort of that has sailed. So I'm personally open to sort of exploring what might we do that I actually, is more useful than than trying to overlay all these meetings on this, you know, one little concept here.

Now that we have a tracker and all these tools, as large as describing, Like, I is Robert, and I think this speaks to your point as well, right?

I will note on the point of times, Cisco had a draft about how caller ID worked for a large portion of the network for same draft for roughly 10 years. We've also been in situations where which, by the way, is still to this day more used than any of the IETF, the RFCs that replace it. The So you have drafts like that that are floating around.

I've been in many working groups where On the working group agenda, we're discussing an expired draft, and it causes confusion for people about what the rules are around that, all those things.

And so, like, concede that these things somehow aspire in a world where, like, they don't expire it's just like a complete map territory confusion.

But I wanna explained my reasoning, for, why I was concerned about that, which is that this is a very simple thing that we should just do it. And to have it dragged out behind some like endless series of, like, we have to do x, y, and z before we can do this is, like, a totally anti pattern.

We can specify conditions on the use of those derivative works. The thing is I'll copy right. Only protects the text of the ROC from copying. It doesn't the protocol from copying. We've seen a number of cases where people have tried to build 10 plus for instance, I didn't need to copy the text of the RFC in order to produce something that was a non interoperable with MPLS.

So let let's just say one of the possible outcomes here is the a risk, the the fork is successful, and I think my response to that is fantastic. Don't think we need to be worried about that. It happens often, and what happens relatively railing in the open source world, but there's a lot of examples of it because there's a great number of projects. And often often often often this is the result of neglect on the part of the original owners, or diversification of needs or any number of things doesn't necessarily need to be an interoperability risk, depends on, you know, the conditions that I was talking about.

The IETF version or the, cheap generic brand version, that could be potentially quite bad. I always seen that with, the the work in Etsy regarding TLS.

And that I think what you currently have is sufficiently unworkable that if it was being dispatched to, an an area director for for publication that it would have to be I I would have to say it should not be dispatched at all dispatched to no.

So one thing I see you're doing is you're conflating code implementations, which which open source, forking, all that kind of good stuff. And, the protocol specifications and the protocols within them. So let me sort of queue back what I mean by that. Open source software has on it a copyright. And that implementation, that code base, you can license. And you can through various open source licenses, grant the ability to fork it and you can specify things you can and can't do with it in those license terms. Because you're granted a license for the code. Within an RFC, the document, we hold a copyright on each of it, There's really 2 cooperates that actually, 2 licenses that apply to a a document. Once the copyright and the overall document itself, if there's any code SIP SIP that's inside the document, We have a separate license if you go look at the, IT Trust TLP, It it gives that breakout, but code code is separately licensed. Actually, there could be a third one, which is examples which can be, they're they're more free and and they're specified. That all said, though, the copyright"

Let's say TLS, we decide whatever you do TLS again, That would be something that, like, as was suggested, maybe the ISG could suggest to the trust. Hey. You guys go off and license it to this group over here. Reviewed it and we've given the thumbs up. We've done the community review and all that. That's a pathway here, but I would recommend against not doing a blanket thing as the sort of generic boiler plate. And then the other comment, this gets really leads here is the name. So in your draft, you specific route, hey, maybe we're gonna license it, but you can't use the name.

It would certainly be a lot easier to do this for documents going forward where they clearly identified in this sort of sense to start with. Just on that point, Colin, RC 5378 has a has a clause in it that specifically says that trust me, may consider more open licensing Yeah.

I think Martin's draft is in the right direction. And we should head that way. I think this this focus on documents is actually kind of missing the point. Value of the I ETF is not the documents as as Martin pointed out, like people can make documents. People make documents all the time. They they you know, writing a, a variant of TLS that, that does the bad things. Not hard. The value of the IETF adds is the consensus and, bringing the right folks to the process. So, like, what's not be precious about our documents and open things up. John Peterson. Yeah. Just to Richard's point, I mean, I think you know, There there are a lot of uncopy writable ideas. That anyone can instantiate in any way they see fit. The point of the trust is to own a set of documents. And documents have copyrights, the uncopurricular ideas that are in them, can be done over in 16 different ways, same with the trademarks as as Glenn mentioned earlier, I mean, I I think there is something with poking. At here. I I think maybe like a non working group forming BAF where we surface what has been discussed about this in the past and, like, kind of see if we can figure out where scope might be for this is. But to be perfectly frank, I mean, I suspect that anybody out in the world probably has the power given how lenient we are about citations, at great length is my understanding and the trust from these documents.

I remember Donald East Lakes presentation in the last meeting. That randomness is there because you need fresh and you need new and you need to some degree more impartiality. And I also worry, and this is my second point on this, that having someone in the role for 2 rounds of hiring people to these positions reduces their impartiality, just ever so slightly, because there are people who are up for leadership positions year over year.

We're not planning on changing any of the limitations, so that if, you know, so for example, what I'm saying is that the current changes you have to post change those limitations. I'm not convinced that they are, and they they need analysis absolutely, but for example, the limit on no two people's from Akamai, that would carry now over for 2 years, not just 1 year. Right? Or no limit. Right? Right now, if you had two people from Akamai on year 1, You could have 2 more people on a 2 different people from Akamai on year 2. Now it would be could have two people from Akamai and again, anyhow, I think it requires some analysis, but I understand your point. Yes. That's illegal, not as tall as Harold. A couple of other things. I think we're considering right now, the commitment of non comm members is pretty intense. So anybody who has got a noncon member in a role in their working group knows that they're not paying a whole lot of attention this week early, not as much as they might.

So the thing that I mostly wanted to say is standing up here is thank you for presenting this as a problem. With some pros and cons of a straw proposal, because I think that it's a worthwhile discussion you've identified you are in a position to assert with authority that there are challenges with the current system. I think it would be worth having a BAF to go through this in more detail and understand you know, what what changes might be need in order to address the known problems maybe it's the straw proposal you have. Maybe there are other ways handle it, but we're pretty smart crowd when presented with a problems base, it actually articulates pros, cons, and possible directions. I think we can have a useful discussion. Thank you for the kind words. Ted Hardy, occasional motorist. I will say that I Give an answer to the dispatch question that I think this particular draft should be dispatched with no action. I don't think the draft is ready for consideration by the brother, IETF at this point in under above or working group, because I think it's not actually convincing that it's optimizing for the right thing. I think Harold set out a cons a set of concerns that indicate why you might optimized for something in security or resistance against particular forms of attack that's pretty compelling to say the current design had a set of things it was optimizing for and changing what optimizing for in order to achieve this goal I don't think the draft is convincing on this point at this at this moment.

How wide did their eyes get? Like, our process is insanely complicated. There might be good reasons for it. I'm sure there are good reasons for that. There might be some few things that can be improved, but Adding a bunch more complication like this is sounds quite worrisome to me. This is already a very delicate equilibrium and more complex systems feel more often is something we've learned in engineering. I'm Turkey. It's a sovereign segment. I do agree that it is already a contact system and perhaps the proposed solutions a bit more complex. Like to, like, just point out to the first sentence that says that the noncompass is actually 2 plus season. I feel like that's where the crux of the problem is and I was wondering, like, if maybe I can better way of going on it is to actually simplify the system by breaking out.

I'm going to say is not intended to kill the, kill the discussion, but somebody has to say it. Some of this is is actually how the ICANN nomcom is set up. It it's very similar. The staggered, works of the of the chairs and essentially is staggered membership of the, appointees, in that case, and the random random people here. So there is prior art, so to speak, and maybe I'm not sure but I had the chance to to talk to people there. I have been on the I can not come as the IITF appointee excuse me, 2 consecutive terms. So I have worked under that in a different, forum of course. I'm not completely sure I understand the problem description. But I have the feeling that you propose 2 solutions might be worth looking at, separately. The one is the experience of the chair that staggered model obviously has some some attractiveness. Except for the long term commitment for for anybody wanting to, to reply. On the level of detail, the pass chair can be the past past chair or anybody, and then you you can fill around with that. A risk that you, I'm not sure I have identified, but that that want to mention is that if you have this continuity on the non comp mem the voting non comp members. And you have the bootstrapping progress process, I'm sorry, where you actually set your own rules then you might wanna see whether continuity is actually a good idea at that stage."

There's one other observation when I mentioned I can, they are major positions have 3 year terms and you have these staggered chairs, with your model in 2 year terms, the past chair would actually review their own assignments from from the previous previous noncon that might or might not be a good idea. Thank you. Thank you. Robert Sparks. I thought, Peter came very close to to stealing what I was coming to say, but he didn't quite get there. One of the features that the current system has that the proposed change loses is a complete shock. Replacement. That that that that that finger identifying as a problem. That the, nomcoms come in with Having to bootstrap from 0, is perhaps not as perhaps more of a feature. Than a problem. When you move from a model where you don't have that shock, to the system, to a model where you've got overlapping continuity. Now have a new system that develops a culture and the culture will self propagate. You know, this is a feature that we have in the ISGs with the rollover we have right now, the ISG teaches the next ISG from the continuing members how things have, you know, gone and we end up with an ISG that has a much more muted state, and it's actual behavior that we might not want out of a nomcom. We wanna we might wanna non come to come in and be able to do something and think radically different than the last one and not as quote was going on with what last night comes."

If you went forward with something like this, I would caution, I I would urge a lot of caution in thinking about the periodicity of replacements. And not necessarily lining them up so much with the periodicity for the bodies that you're appointing for, less you set up on weird resonance. Those are both really interesting and excellent points. Thank you, Tuolition. Thank you. Thanks, Rich. I read the graph interesting proposal. There's like 2 like different things that came to my mind. First one is I don't like the 2 year term thing. Right? Like, because it kind of narrows down the volunteer pool more because you're gonna have a even more restricted set of people are willing to come in time for 2 years. So it's actually gonna make it like probably less diverse, like less the things we want. Right? I think that's the biggest concern I have, right? Don't see it necessarily the start up speed increasing because of that. So that's like one part of it. The part I really liked is the, the chair side, which is very interesting to, like, kind of do the, the incoming chair shadow. I really like that idea. There might be some logistical difficulties to that because if Can somebody know a year from now whether they'll be available for a year after. Right? I think that's something you can explore. But I do like the idea that the incoming share share of the previous share before. Thanks. You have Samuel and to Right. May I? Yeah, please. Sam Wyler. I've served on 2 non cons as a voting member. We've had noncomes with varying degrees of cultural experience. We've had one to where many people had been on non comms before we've had one to where fewer had. But we, we give those non comms a chance to appoint advisors."

    "text": "So an oncom that wanted more continuity could appoint pass chairs or pass voting members as advisors at their discretion. Now we had a case 3 years ago, where chair wanted to appoint some advisors I believe her nomcom declined to accept. But I'm still comfortable leaving that discretion with the nomcom and not forcing extra continuity on them. I I'm content with the status quo. Houston with your permission. Yeah. Book part of this, because I was part of non comm last year, which is why I'm a co author here. Is that getting 10 people in a chair in a new job that they've got no feel to put some like, you know, bunnies in the headlight they really spend a lot of time struggling with what they have to do. And by the end of this process when you're meant to actually complete the appointments, it's rushed. It's extremely rushed. Wouldn't wouldn't say ill considered but certainly considered with a very tight time frame. That does not necessarily lead to outcomes that are in the best interest of this organization. And so it's trying to understand how you can provide a framework that allows this process to actually get a little better at the job trying to do. And that's this element of continuity. This approach is one of the best ways that I felt in talking to Rick about how do you get both the chair and some of the members to lend some of that experience going forward. So that not everything is a complete surprise to everybody. Now there's still ten people selected at random. It's just the selection occurs over 2 years rather than 1. So I don't buy the it's no longer as random as it used to be. It is still random."

So I may not have enumerated the problem statement well, Leslie, and I'm sorry. And it was a leap to this thing provides better continuity. But it's certainly an honest effort to try and understand how we can improve. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. Totally agree. And I if I didn't say it as well as could have been wouldn't have been the first time I did that. In a in a in a in a in a gen dispatch meeting. Well, Seems like, more work is needed or more clarity.
