So let me, share the session slides Curtis, I can roll with this if you'd like to intro the speakers. Yeah? When we get ready, Sure. Sounds good. Okay. Cool. Hello everybody in the room. We just wanna thank you very much for attending, Giat, IETFI or TF1119. Thank you to our host, there in Brisbane and huge thanks to the APNIC Foundation wave at Sylvia who's at the table in front of you, Sylvia, give him a wave, and there's Ritu, also who's there with APNIC Foundation. APNIC has helped bring, folks to the IETF and they've also been gracious enough to agree to help us up there, at the table in case something gets a little wonky, you all, should be, familiar with Noelle from other you've been in. I'm not gonna read through it. The first time I did people laughed at me, So, anyway, please do take note of the note well. And please note really well. And seriously, there are certain, code of conduct. There's different, issues, you know, you're being recorded. Does everyone everyone's not aware of that, then you are. So please just, have a look online if you need to. And please, if you will, make sure you've scanned the QR code so that you are logged in as a participant if you're not, already. Here are some meeting tips. Probably very familiar with this by now, but just, heads up on that. Use of headset strongly recorded if you're online, just so that people can hear you well."

And read to Resources for IACF Brisbane you're all aware of this by now because it's Tuesday, but, here you go. And we have some great speakers who are going to speak, 20 minutes each. I'll help keep time on this end. And, in the room, they'll help us. With 10 minutes of Q And A. When we hit the Q And A, if you could keep your observations, short and your questions short so that we can get in as many questions as possible. Over to you Curtis. Yeah. With a light caveat on that, as people who have been in Gaia for a little bit. This is a small change of the format. We used to have 15 minutes with 5 minutes of questions, but, without, as though, basically, every single time we were, like, shoving people off of the mic, So we've switched to 2, then 20 minutes, with 10 minutes so that we have 4 speakers. Hopefully that'll go well, but I think everyone should feel free to open it up a little bit, try to have a little bit more discussion. That's an explicit goal of ours to create a little bit more space for that here. I I think, we're still working on flip slides, though. He's posted them in the chat. Okay. I am going to, stop sharing here and have a go there, see if you can load up, Phil, if you, if you can't, I can share your old ones because the video may be tricky.

Welcome, flip Who is an old colleague of mine. I haven't seen him in many years now, but has been moving on since being a grad student at the University of the Philippines to do, some stuff for the, for DAF the science and technology organization, for the government of the Philippines. And I was really excited to hear more about what they've been doing with the rain project, and gotta say some really great acronyms. I've been really, really excited about, your guys' ability to put together. Really good project titles. So, flip, go for it. Hi, Anna. Good, aft good afternoon here in the Philippines. I'm here. Thank you for the opportunity Curtis to discuss this with you, regarding our project. Resilient education information infrastructure for the new normal or let's just call it rain for sure. Next slide, please. So, a little bit more about institute, we are called the Advanced Science And Technology Institute. We are a branch of the government, that is tasked to perform research in, ICT or in, information in communications technology. So that's our goal, to perform this session already on ICT.

So we were tasked to, deliver technology solutions that could aid some schools that are lagging behind because of the set set up in order for them to help have at least, have the benefits of having to to perform, remote or online, learning setups. And, we are also banking on the opportunity for us because, we have still to shift from analog to digital TV. Admin and if that happens, there will be, a portion of our frequencies that will, be vacated and we were trying developed technology solutions using that frequency in order for us to, to, to, to say to our lawmakers that to a lot of these, slot of frequencies for example, for, mobile connectivity and, for other needs. For example, our 600 Megahertz spectrum, we will we will be vacated some of it, And we are advocating to to use that spec 3 for, community networks and all other alternative solutions. Using LTE band 71, 4 g tour if possible 5 g at 600 600 Megahertz And we are also exploring on, non internet based solution using the same frequencies. We are exploring the data casting capability of the ISDB standard, which we will be adapting we are performing some laboratory tests wherein we are we are delivering power plants. We are delivering delivering PDFs using our low, power TV transmitter. And, we are trying to, set up that data carousel in a normal Iestivity broadcast, and we were able to do so. So,"

We are also delivering, on premise cash content. Optimize the usage of Internet in these areas. For example, all in areas where the only solution would be satellite Internet. And it is very expensive. So we are we are creating this some kind of, walled garden wherein we are partnering with with content providers in order for us to host the content. In the premises so that, they would have less resources to to use the in for some if if for example, if the educational materials are already already on premise, then they don't have to, search for the internet for the needed resources. And the core technology of this, be because we are, targeted towards education, the the core technologies could also be used for other cross cutting, sectors, for example, if disaster is reduction, So next slide. So, unfortunately, we would, we for a lot of better word, we had some just with our regulatory For example, we were prohibited to, to have a public image of use of 600 Megahertz LTE. On a public demonstration. So what we did is that temporarily, we shifted to Wi Fi, we have this technology called in the Philippines, or piece of Wi Fi, where you see wherein, they have by vouchers for time based Internet access. So, the concept is still the same. We still have, on premise content in our servers. It's just that the delivery is not through LTE."

And you can see the captive portal where in the upper part of the captive portal sure, voucher log in and on the bottom side, you can access the on premise applications that I will discuss later. Next slide. So this tether technology that uses the digital TV. We call it rural casting. However, our public demonstration on data casting has been on hold So, we then shifted our focus for the meantime to develop the online LMS or the learning management system and an e library. So the same content can be said in the archives docs. I see it's a full package with the touch screen. And, Wi Fi hotspot so that other devices could connect to it and access services inside. We also develop a super cost effective solution wherein it's just an ARPA with a, that serve that services a file server. For for any library. Next slide, So this is the summary of the technologies that we currently have, So we have the local LTE network. Which is not publicly demonstrated, but it's, functionally working on a lab setup. We have the local 5, which is our Wi Fi, network with, locally cash content, we call our our video, repository app local flicks. If, you can say Netflix and Shell, we say local fix and learn.

So, unfortunately, I cannot play you the video But, let's just say that that is a working demo the, a roller casting box, wherein, it receives a normal TV broadcast, but along the TV broadcast, it has it is saving the file of a translator that the students will be answering after the test broadcast, For the local file, it should show you a double station of the captive portal as soon as you, log in in the local fine network.

And, 9966 is outside of the cap natural capital region. So we have deployed up, in, 2 high schools, and, 6 Elementary Schools And, out of the 9, only 4 has the Internet, installations, the other five we we we are able to deploy the rural casting box because in these areas, they already have internet infrastructure, especially those in the, national capital region, what we did is that, we are we still notice the gaps even if they have the internet connection. So we have, deployed our our non Internet a non interest rate. And non Internet based solution, which is the rule of casting bastion. You absorb seen earlier. So, that is the project reach, amounting to around 1500 students in Amazon Island in the fleet. Next slide, So here are some pictures on how they are using the marine, our casting box, we we just did an Internet based solution.

So, if they're not using the internet, they are using the, videos and the, applications that, are hoo locally hosted they have to control. However, the the internet usage because, the the situation is that the students are using the Internet during school hours. And then the adults or the head of households will then go to the school and access the internet during the nighttime. So they have to establish rules in the set for, the pick on the right says that, you must leave the school premises at 10:30 pm. So So that's the gist of that, of that notice. So, there has been use cases for dog internet use and there has also been a use cases for complement, on premise contents, to compliment the internet use of the school Next slide. So we also had a a trial of different power designs. The 1st tower design with is the is the design that we have inherited from my previous project. The village police station project.

However, we are also looking forward to the sustainability of the set program And, we are banking on the school community and the lgu that we had established. For example, the lgu, through a memorandum or agreement, has allotted funds and sent a strain personnel for the maintenance. We also taught them how to, to, to reset the, the system, just in case, the ether is not working, etcetera, And, in one in, in one of the installations, we have agreed upon a business entity is within the community that will take over the operations of the system And we are leveraging on the relations between the local school in the community because, once we the project is ended.

For example, a 5 peso, coin will give you 40 minutes of internet the, that is, essentially the, piece of vending, Wi Fi. So you can do away with the, coin setup and issue vouchers instead.

Allows you to get a lot of the resources that, normally, are included in Moodle courses like pdfs and videos and recorded lectures down very efficiently. My question is, have you, talk about contributing any of your changes that you're made to Moodle specific, with specific focus on any changes you made to have a moodles set up that efficiency uses a low package. Yeah. The team is currently looking into that. But, main r and d or or domain, changes that we had, since the 4 is that we are able to deliver the deltas or just the changes using data casting.

And I remember so much of the difficulty we had was on backhaul, that satellite piece, you mentioned, you know, Lately Starlink as a partner, how has that been? I feel like, my own experience has just been how dramatic the shift has been with the arrival of some of the communities we're in. So much so that people just, you know, we act every house in one of our Arctic Villages, has one. What has the experience been in, rural Philippines in regards to Starlink and your experiences using it as a platform. Yeah. Interesting thing is that maybe Starlink has lowered, the, subscription cost for, a household maybe, but We are positioning this project as a way for Sterling to enter a green market We said that, maybe, as a household, they cannot afford the monthly subscription, but as a community, they can pitch in the, needed resources in order for them to continue the subscription of the starting. So, in a way, if they are not satisfied with the, shared bandwidth that they are experiencing using the community network. Then they can subscribe directly to Starlink. So that's what we that's the pitch that we had made with our partner. So, the community networks are, our our way to entice our future, subscribers of the Starlink nodes Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Are you worried that The, like, most valuable customers will be taken away from the network yet because they're gonna start just grab their own Starlink solution. Yeah. Yeah. That is the risk that, we are also, looking at, but, big but because, they are still, households that are not that affluent to own their, old starlink. That is still the main driver on on why these communities can exist because, they can they can pay, more, not more, but, they can, continue the subscription even without those, most affluent, households. And And, there is a continued support, or there's a common fund from the school that can supplement the subscription I think so, Rajeev, unfortunately, we are out of time. Feel free to have the discussion, in the chat with Flip to continue that.

Video stations are the video stations which are owned by primarily by civil society organizations as well as committees so that there are about 44,000 community radio stations across the world. Some of the numbers are here that Philippines and Thailand and India have the largest number of our radio stations along with, like, even like a Nepal, which is a very small country, still have an largest number of radio stations as well. And these radio stations are owned by committee, managed by committee well as, operated by a committee, and they are primarily into the local region where internet is not either not available or a media dark zone areas are there. We're not even a newspaper or sometimes it's not coming as well. Similarly, in our committee networks, which are right now in operating, which we also call as a alternative connectivity models which are operated in a around 100 community networks are operating across the world. Some of the countries which are primarily community networks are in are India, Philippines, Thailand, and so many other countries where we have it. Time. It's Before, So the one of, next slide please Yes. So why I why the committee radio stations why computer networks are, together? Because one of the uniqueness about the committee radio stations that they do have a technical infrastructure such as local or service space and a tower. And at the height of a tower, which can be utilized further for the distribution of the network. So it's not being utilized currently the most of our radio stations are putting their radio radio, handsets, and transmitter and receivers. But not for the distribution of the connectivity or anyone. These radio stations are underutilized as per the optimal utilization can be"

They understand the local they are able to distribute the local content and produce the local content. That's why they are within their communicators. Itself. They do have a skilled human resource who can understand the broadcast transmitting and everything. We do give him a upscale there. They do have an under they can also able to manage the network as well. The server space is really important for us because we this because in a committee networks, we talk about the in connectivity. With or without the internet. When we say that with or without the internet, it may ops may happen that we do not have a backhaul, but it's still the commit connectivity is maintained through the local network so that the communication is still maintained but maybe the in the people are not able to access the internet per se. So but these two committee owned institutions are working in isolation in most of the countries. And timely. And this is why I took, one of the step in India that 2 put the, router and the wireless routers on the radio station and use the height of the tower and the local in structured, which is available. In to set up a com 1st committee radio station in India. One of the good thing about the radio station is also that they do have a lease line of an internet as per in India, they should they should have it at least 10 years of a lease line, which is completely underutilized. Because they are using it for, uploading the content and so and so forth. But not using it further. So the the so that's the another way of utilization of a internet, what they already have. So these are the common attributes for those ones, infrastructure, technology, and life license is the one of the most important thing because in India, radio stations do have a right license to"

So as, the, the what the model which I'm seeing is as a CR Bolo, c CR is a company radio and in English bono is a Hindi word which says that speak And this is the way which we have set in that, network. It's a cost effective model, which is owned by committee, managed by committee, operated by committee. What we have done in a local infrastructure We have established the wireless network routers, which is using a whatever is available, whatever is available locally, So currently, we are using microtech router and ubiquity routers for setting up a point to point networks. We have established around, 3 access points within the circle within the radius of a 3 to 5 kilometers of a radio station, and then we have connected them the point to point net. Look. Apart from that, we along with that, we have created a local network which can out of 5 to, 7 3 to 5 kilometers. But we also coupled with it. IVR interactive voice response system, which is operating on a GSM bag as well as on the local network. For that purpose, we have created our own open source software. We, use it more for the open source software for this IVR setup. That's a local page which we have it. You can see that the photo"

Form and where we have used all sort of most probably the all sort of my my open source, platforms such as big, big blue, black, and all sorts of things. So that rocket chat so that they can work. Without the internet as well. Necessarily like this, In a technical infrastructure, I have already mentioned that that the what they have done it have used simple low cost router, whatever is available, Why? Because procurement is a huge challenge for us. Of our devices, and we cannot afford, big, Cisco devices or certain things for our setup up of the routers. So we use whatever is available locally and to maintain locally and to troubleshoot locally. We, because Odessa is a location place where is a which is a huge heavy rainfall, and the electricity goes down. So we have backed up by the solar enabled routers. We are simply using a 2.45.8, unless in the spec up. And, for this, this, for the point to point connectivity. And As I already mentioned that we are using the communication, different kind of communication platforms, for this purpose. Our IVR is also open source. We are not using any kind of a proprietary software as of now because Well, it's not that we are against our propriety as a phone because we can't afford it for going forward about that. So we are using that kind of a, a thing So that's the technical infrastructure. Next slide, please.

That's still the cost is a half of the traditional ISP provider. When we talk about the committee networks, we also say that it should be managed locally. And so that that's this is why we train the local people. On how to set up the network what kind of a troubleshooting is required locally and how to procure them, procure the infrastructure as well as procure the devices and everything else. And this is why one of the social capital which we falls upon the networks is also that, you have is you have a people who those who are man able to manage the network locally. Instead of someone who is coming from a urban city and managing the work there itself because that the cost of a travel is really high on those local people as well. Next slide, please. So, This, when we set up a network, we also think about that how this net connectivity can be use meaningfully. So we do provide a different kind of a services. Whether it's, connecting the nearby local hood, local people. Well, it's and the location where I'm right now is a primary with the fishing community. And, very small level of a people. Very small institutions are there. So we try to engage with such women, self help group women, and staff members, local NGOs, and the public institutions, which are which could be a public health public health care centers or schools settled. So currently, the connection connectivity is deployed in 3 schools. And 2 microenterprises. And this network is used by a to have a converse to have a conversation and to sell their product locally"

To set up the network, but this is another location where we is a school where we have used the bamboo to set up the router. And then Now we are also exploring bamboo Towers to set up a network. Why? Because, definitely, the bamboo is cultivated in in such a coastal region, and it is easy to maintain. Password. And the cost will go further down for bringing the connectivity. Next slide please. I think the and this is the one, for Dora, which I have put because Here, we train the people and how to make the network, how to troubleshoot it, and also train them that how to make a small small thing like a audio 45 connector, which is still a very costly in in such locations, even getting a, RJ 45, is cost I can tell you that which I took it from my daily location, which cost me around, 17 rupees or a 30 rupees. There, I cost around 100 100 rupees, which is around $2 for me. It's a exponentially increase the cost and when we have to buy it. So the that's why we make allow make them to make such kind of a Manage the network and troubleshoot the network locally itself. Jim, next I think that's my last flight.

I think in a previous slides where I had mentioned that I have used a rocket chat with blue battered and some of, open source of, applications for the connectivity purpose. So this module is a local one which we have made it. For the IVR software, but Wabois is the one which we have used it. And, also, we have used for the those ones for the communication purpose. How many users do you support at the time the local network. Yeah. So the currently where we are located is a very high, densely populated area It's the, radio station is covering around 10,000 population size. But through this network, we are serving around 3000 population size, individuals which we call control of all. And, one at a time, there are one at a time, we are serving around 2250 people at each location, at each access points. Since our connectivity is going through the school. So primarily the users are students, as well as local women those who use the network, and it's just to highlight that even if there are traditional ISP providers are there, the cost of an is really high for them.

I think one thing, and I haven't been working in this community network space for a while, One thing that I'm really noticing has been, as you just mentioned, kind of more deployments in denser urban areas, rather than the kind of rural connectivity that I think drove a lot of at least my research. And so I'm curious about especially in India given the variety of low cost providers, in that market how this system sort of coexists with with all of that. That's a nice question. I think that the one of the thing that in India, you can exist with the, I traditional, different layers of ISP providers. Why? Because One of the things that ISP Providers They do they are there, but the connectivity they will provide, but the troubleshooting services are really cost. Once it is down, then it is down for Aman. So that's the way the challenge come, especially in rural areas. The this is the one set up, which I have done, but the other set up, which I'm going to do, which is a hundred kilometers from, color handy district. Where there's no connectivity, no mobile tower. And, we use going not even 2 g collectivity. So when we are going to set it up, it's I the one of the challenge which we are going to face is bringing the backhaul connectivity.

I'm I'm One of the, is that they are the cause of a connectivity is the still a challenge in India, despite the fact there's a huge number for mobile internet connectivity. Because India is a 1,400,000,000. So Any numbers is a huge number. But, in a reality, in a real sense, the still 20%, 27% of the population is still not connected to the any sort of connectivity. So it's easy to maintain that one. And, while being located in a local region, managed by the committee itself. Local people, it's easy to maintain because we do have a connections with the local enterprises. We have a strong hold with the local people and understanding of a local like, and everything. Which helps us out to maintain the network better than the, I the traditional ISP providers, And that's the that's the way which we work around as I hope I have answered your question. It's to exchange, Were there any issues with, did you have any opposition from ISPs that might be nearby, but not connecting the community. And has the government been supportive? A two part question. So far, I have not so before we have not phased opposition from the local ISP providers because to certain extent, they are also our backup providers.

So, Jonathan Brewer here, and, I'm going to talk about, New Zealand's 3.3gigahertzmanage spectrum Park. How do I advance the slides? I just wait for Jane to advance, and this is how this works. Just give me a cue, and I'll Yep. do it. Perfect. Alright. So with the managed Spectrum Park, it's a concept that was, agreed by, regulators and parliament in, or or cabinet in 2007. Implemented in 2010. Is it government managed spectrum right? Not one that's been sold off to a carrier. Where the government can enter into license agreements with local and regional, providers, internet service providers, to, to give them the right to use spectrum that normally would be only for a cellular operator. So the first spectrum that was released was, from 25.80 to 26.20. And that's, LTE band 41. There were relatively strict acquisition limits, you could only take maybe 5 or 7 small geographic areas, and they had to be contiguous. So you weren't allowed to look at New Zealand and just pick the big cities, you could pick the big city and the and around it"

    "text": "but you couldn't just say, I wanna pick the 5 biggest cities in New Zealand take a little bit of spectrum into each of those, that that was, against the rules. So strict utilization rules in that you had to deploy a working network, and show that it was in use within two years of taking your allocation, or seed the spectrum back to the government. Another, Part of this managed Spectrum park was the idea that, park users operators within the Spectrum park are supposed to cooperate. And, this didn't always happen. And so in, 2021, the park was closed to new applicants. Now that doesn't mean that existing users have had to stop or shut down their networks. Existing users continue on but, no new users have been allowed into the spectrum for a couple of years now. And our government really hasn't told us when that's gonna change next slide, please. So, because this 2.6 gigahertz park was, shut down Providers in New Zealand wireless ISPs, especially those serving rural and remote areas have still needed more spectrum than just 5 gigahertz and because, local and regional use of 3 gigahertz is present in a lot of markets in the world, Most popularly in the US where it's known as CBRS or since band radio service. And because the 3.3to3.8gigahertz radio band was in the process of being replanned in New Zealand for use for 5 g. The government partitions the band into blocks and they left the bottom 110 megahertz of this allocation for local and regional use."

    "text": "Inside of that local and regional use band, they took the bottom 40 megahertz and turn that into in Managed Spectrum Park. Next slide, please. So Cool. The band Has a lot of points of contention between the mobile operators and the wireless ISPs. And in New Zealand, there are around 30 active wireless ISPs each of whom has between A few 100 and a few thousand subscribers that the smallest are around the, 100 to 200 mark. And the largest are Coming close to 10,000 subscribers on their own access networks. So the mobile network operators thought that the entirety of 3.3to3.8gigahertz should be used for 5 g. With a Tdd, time division duplex, Timing configuration, very particular to 5 g that would only support transmissions in a 9 kilometer cell radius. Now, if we're talking about rural and remote sites, and 9 kilometers doesn't get you far. It's great for suburban use and urban use. It's actually quite big for urban use, but it's good for suburban use. Ex urban use, but it's not good for rural and remote, especially in parts of New Zealand do have, 1 to 5 people per square kilometer live living across the regions. So the local and regional providers, weren't interested in 5 g they really wanted to use LTE. And they wanted to use it in a configuration that would allow them to broadcast 32 kilometers from their tower, out to their furthest subscriber and also, the local providers wanted the spectrum anywhere above 3.4 gigahertz, but not really at the bottom of the allocation. And I think the next slide we'll kind of explain that."

And, I've also noted, the 5 g new radio band So this is the the 5 g that is most commonly deployed around the world now for, for urban areas. It ranges from 3.3to3.8gigahertz. Okay, next slide. So, a little digression here, and, this is a point where I have a strong disagreement with New Zealand's regulator, Who believe that 4 g is end of life, and that, operators should only be deploying 5 g. Now in my work throughout the region, I'm still advocating for 4g and new 4g deployments because it's my perspective that new 4 g equipment will continue to be developed until around, 2030 and continue to be installed. And we do still see development of 4 g, significantly in small cells and low power, low cost equipment. We're starting to see, a lot of interesting new equipment available, using very low power, at very low cost. So if we look at the operational lifetime of the previous generations of technology. 2 g was still being employed until about 2015. And, a lot of markets won't shut off their 2 g I mean, some of them have planned to shut it off in 2025. And some of them, we'll just keep going with it probably until 2030. 3 g is, kind of baked in, to the world. I was just discussing with a journalist"

So, so there are a lot of people in wealthy markets using 3 g And if you look to Africa, there are a huge amount of 3 g only funds there. And some carriers in Africa are are continuing to new three gs sites even this year. So I I think that 4 g is, a valid technology choice for building we're on remote networks today and still will be for another few years. Next slide, please. So here's the bone of contention. The bonus contention has to do with time division duplex, synchronization. And this is really arcane. But Bear with me for a moment. LTE. Has, 10 millisecond long, patterns where, sorry, has has 5 can be configured as 5 millisecond long patterns and across the top of this colorful chart here, we have two frames, two five millisecond frames here. We have a download frame, A special claim, which is a mix of download, pause and upload traffic, We have an upload frame, We have another download frame, and we have another download frame. And then we start the cycle over again. We have another 5 millisecond where we have a download A special and upload downloaded a download. That special frame, how you configure that determines your cell radius, because in TDD communications, you need to stop sending your data towards your subscribers and wait for a little bit until the waves actually physically have enough time to get to your subscribers and they have time to start transmitting back to you. So there's a little pause in there too to keep things synchronized."

    "text": "Anyway, it's possible for, 5 g which is a technology that has, can have a 2 a half millisecond or a 5 millisecond alignment. It's possible for 5 g to synchronize with 4 g If 5 g has a 5 millisecond frame alignment, It's also possible if, 5 g is set for 2 a half milliseconds, then it it won't synchronize at all. And so, I have 3 different options for configuring your networks here across the top And the one that New Zealand's government has chosen is the one at the very bottom. Which, actually has conflicts between download traffic and upload traffic between 4g5g If you have a conflict like this and you've got 2 operators, Next to each other. Maybe you know, geographically adjacent, say within 30 or 50 kilometers, they'll interfere with each other. If you have them geographically, collocated like on the same tower but on different frequencies, if the frequencies are adjacent to each other, These networks will interfere with each other. So, it's a it's really not ideal to have a different, configuration, different TDD configuration between 2 technologies that are in the same spectrum block. So, next slide. That's that's really technical part. So back to this whole LTE thing, there are a lot of networks in this world that are still running LTE in 3 gigahertz band. And as a result, when operators are deploying 5 gigahertz in, the 3 gigahertz, but when they're deploying 5 g in the 3 gigahertz frequency band, they're doing it in a compatibility mode that they don't interfere with their neighbors in Europe.

And and the US is, important here because a lot of the equipment for, small, networks for for wireless ISPs I is meant for the US market. Next slide, please. Ah, yeah. And then we have markets with LTE and the 3.3to3.4gigahertz, and, used to be China. We've banned 52. And today, it's none because China has repurposed their band 52, in to, 5 g Next. So what sort of equipment can we get for LTE and 3 gigahertz band. You can get transmitters that Cost as little as $600, you can probably get them cheaper now. You can make LTE transmitters out of software defined radios, you can get them from low cost, manufacturers like buy cells, you can get them from specialist companies like blank or cable free. Yeah, there's a whole list of them here. And of course, you can get them from traditional providers. My list down here, is just aimed at wireless ISPs. Of course, in addition to these, Manufacturers, you're going to have Nokia and Ericsson and Samsung and NEC also making 4 g equipment for band 42 band 43, band 48. But, yeah, the key key is that you can get very low power equipment. And your transmitters are are very inexpensive. Next slide, So let's talk about, oh, yeah.

I and I know, if if You have any experience with solar power. Well, at a certain was showing those those IOT stations, in, on the the border of Changmai province there. Those solar panels above his, his IOT stations were like 20 watt solar panels. If you've got a 200 watt, LTE installation, you really need to have, at least 1500. We close to 2000 Watts of electricity to, Be able to collect enough to put it in batteries and store through nighttime and periods of cloud and rain. And so on. So it's no small feat to provide 200 watts of a continuous power to an LTE installation. Next slide. And then we get to 5 g equipment, and 5 g equipment is even more expensive. And, I've listed the cheapest, 5 g transmitter that I know about, which is American company called Wifrost, who, are famous for from AT space equipment. And Wifrost, have just, increased their product range from TV white space and LTE and TV white space to carrying 5 g. Their lowest power units take around 300 watts and their lowest cost transmitter is $1400 per sector. So a 2 or 3 sector site, is once you've added your power system, and and everything else is probably gonna be 80 or a 100,000 US dollars. It's it's just Outdoes.

Next slide. There is one other option That is a, TDD wireless equipment, that can synchronize with 5 g. But is not 5 g compatible. And a company called Cambium has a product called the 450i, that, is around a 1000 US dollars consumes only 18 watts, doesn't have a huge amount of throughput. But, you can configure it for two and a half millisecond frames. Which means that you can deploy it on the same tower as 5 g in an adjacent band, you can deploy it, within range of a, another 5 g system without, interfering with it without being interfered with. Next slide. So now we're gonna go on to the rules of our 3a half gigahertz managed spectrum park. Just like in the 2.6 gigahertz park, It's regional and non national. There are acquisition limits. This time around, we have population based utilization fees. So if you take a, a license in an area that has only a few hundred people you're gonna pay a fixed fee per transmitter which is less than a $100 a year, And then you're gonna pay a variable fee based on the population. And that variable fee is gonna be A few pennies per user per year. If you're taking the spectrum in Auckland, where you have a million people, will those few pennies add up? If you're taking the spectrum in a rural area that has a thousand people, you're not going to notice the fees. So population based utilization fees Not a bad idea. There is a 2 year implementation"

So you don't have to use 4 g or 5g You don't have to be synchronized with your neighbors. And, this is why Providers have been limited to 33100 to 30 3 40 megahertz. Only 40 megahertz of a 100 hand set aside for local and regional use. They want to keep, providers who may be using an unsynchronized technology, separated from providers using 5 g. I, well, in in this case, 70 megahertz So So this this is kind of the the penalty for, allowing the use of a non technology and a synchronize band is that you need to have separation, between channels. And in this case, the the regulator has chosen 70 megahertz. And there was a complicated process for initial access, but on too complicated. Next slide, please. So, engineering of these licenses in New Zealand Engineering is outsourced to private individuals. The government, approves radio engineers, and radio engineers are allowed to write licenses into the registry of radio frequencies, that are then, signed off by the regulator and put into force. In practice, there are only 2 engineers participating in this spectrum band because it is turned out to be very difficult. So what happens when you, Want to engineer for this band? Well, first, you have to predict your coverage. You have to define your coverage area."

So the effective radiated power is probably closer to 200 watt the subscriber units are small dishes. They're, 400, millimeter dishes, And, they have a gain of 20 DDI and a transmit power of around, 20 lots after antenna game. This is all licensed. So we get a lot more power to work with than you do in unlicensed communications. So here's our our coverage prediction. And go on to the next slide, I have to take that and at the moment manually define a coverage shape, shape file to upload to the register. It has to be manual because I tried, making automated shapes. And the first shapes that came up with the regulator said is there Not comp not complicated enough. They're not showing the contours and the terrain. And then the next go I had with automated shape creation was These shapes are too complicated. You've given us so many vertices on these polygons. That our system can't even store it. Can you please give us a polygon that has no more than 300 further season. And, okay, well, I'm fine. I'll just do it manually.

There on the left and the, I think that chart is just showing us, db Watts decibel watts of power emitted So we can see, in this case, the bulk of our power is being admitted to the northwest and, with a down tilt that looks biased towards around 5 degrees. Most of the, the radiated energy is between 0 and around -10 degrees. So we've got a good down tilt. We're up on a mountain. We're tilting down. Next slide. And, you can look at and see my my beautiful shape that I drew in the red of radio frequencies also. Xslide. So, I think this is like the last slide even. So this is what it looks like when you've deployed it. And, this is, 3 different sites. There's 2 of"

    "text": "of the same in one photo and, and 2 different ones. The other photo in all cases here, we have the, cambium 450m, which is an 8 by 8 MIMO radio. This guy takes around a hundred watts of electricity. These Fights. The sites on the left are Maine's powered sites. The site on the right actually has a huge bank of solar panels the site on the right is in a very sunny region called Nelson, and, and never has any problems with Sun but the, the sites on the left yeah, they get cold and dark in the winter, and they get note on. So so they have mains power. Anyway, very, quite low cost, for the amount of Throughput that you're getting, this radio is capable of 800 megabits per second of capacity. The providers I worked with in engineering, this haven't configured for 600 megabits per second down. 200 megabits per second up, and they're, typically loading a maximum of 80. Subscribers, sharing that bandwidth. So, that, Jane, is that my last slide? Oh, no. Okay. I I also, I I gave you at a certain this is my lying Buddha impression re reclining Buddha impression of New Zealand. So I've I've I've just you know, tilt tilted it over so that so that he's Yeah. Anyway, this is all of the licenses. And, I've taken these licenses from the registry of radio frequencies via API So I've done an API query and then I'm just, drawing the shape files, in on and making a kml. So, in a 6 month period, when were able to register licenses in this managed spectrum park."

There's no coverage there. But but lots of coverage in, in areas where with large per rural populations. Anything else, Jane? That's it. Alright. Done, but, any questions left? Any any questions from the audience? Yep. Thank you so much, Sean. Questions, please get into the 2 Might have been a bit much. It wasn't fine. I am at the loss as to why not just give the whole spectrum to 5 g for the providers. Why this park on But what is buying? have Okay. The the providers chosen a 5 g technology that has a cell radius of 9 kilometers. This means that it's not economic for the deploy 5 g outside of population densities a fewer than, say, a hundred people per square kilometer. 5 g in New Zealand is only going to be employed in cities and towns. There's no way that in this frequency band, 5 g will be deployed in most of the areas where these rural and remote providers are giving service. The rural and remote providers need the spectrum because the 5 gigahertz band, which is open, is highly congested in these areas. Thank you. You're welcome."

I'm gonna message John about afterwards because I got very confused But, It's on me. Brian, go ahead. Alright. Let me am I unmuted? Can people hear me? Yes. We can go ahead. Excellent. Cool. Hi, Devin. How's it going? Great talk. Very interesting stuff. I'm gonna ask a short rambling question that basically tries tie together two things here. So all of these providers or all of these licenses are basically to relatively small rural ISPs. Correct? So these are a small role. So this is sort of in that CapEx band of of tens to 100 of 1000 of New Zealand dollars to do a deployment. It it it even tens 10 tens of 1000 of US dollars for a deployment some of these deployments will be under $10,000. So not gonna be under $5000. I'm Okay. So we really are starting to get into this band where, like, you could have community network operators playing in this space. Right? Like, so earlier we saw talks about, like, CapEx in the 100 to low 1000 of US dollars for, community radio providers doing doing this sort of stuff. Has there been any overlap of, like, community radio in rural areas in New Zealand operating these networks, or is it still is there still too much of a band gap in the in the, capital expenditure here. It it's more of the case that, some private community radio operators got into wireless Internet as a side business. So there is an overlap but, the community radio in New Zealand so free and open that individuals can start broad casting, with with on a shoestring."

    "text": "Okay. So it really is that that that the community radio is is just cheaper relative to the rest of the economy there than it would place like India. It's very, very inexpensive here. Okay. Cool. Nice. Thank you very much. I can see you again. And I think we're out of time. Yep. We are officially at time now. Thank you all for coming to join. I posted in the chat the Gaia mailing list. Everyone should jump on that, and for the next IETF in Vancouver, which is delightfully close to me. You anyone come and meet me in person, I will be attending. If anyone has any talks they'd like to give, of course, reach out to Jane and I, Our current plan is for 2 talks plus a panel on leo because we think we can get some LEO folks to come out to Vancouver. So, also, if you have interesting points or people on the Leo space that you think would make good panel participants for Gaia similarly reached out to Jane and I. Otherwise, thank you so much to the speakers. This worked out fantastically. I feel like we had exactly the right amount of, speaking and questioning and discussing, and we will see you all next time. Thank you, everyone. And thank you, Sylvia, and reach to man the table in the front. So much for helping out of mine. Justine, and I not make it to Brisbane. It was too Thank you so much. Be well. Thank you so much. Hold on."
