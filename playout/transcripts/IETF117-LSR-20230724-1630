One of the things that was added in v 1 was discussion of a capability, advertisement associated with MP Support There was a lot of debate about that. There's even debate among within the authors themselves, in November 2022, We put out v 2. We removed. discussion of the capability advertisement not because we had reached consensus, but because we hadn't reached consensus, We wanted to move forward. with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with base, MP stuff, So we tried to take out the stuff that was Controversial, And v 3 was published in May, and the major addition there is specification of the applicability of MPTLV, to the various code points. Next slide, please. So what's the context? The problem we're trying to solve is the base protocol has an inherent limitation The length of a TLV is maximum is an 8 bit number, so it's 255 is the maximum size of the TLV. with the new features that have have been deployed over the last several years, there's a need to advertise more than 255 bytes for some of the commonly used TLVs, particularly neighbors and prefixes, The there are existing use of MP today based upon for various TLVs. There's a list here on the slide. this was so there's a number of TLVs MP has already been specified for a number of years. So the natural extension is to use the same technology and apply it to other DLVs,"

Some implementations have actually done this. and successfully deployed it. and interoperated, but it is understood. that if you have a network where some of the nodes support MP for a given TLV, and some nodes do not. that the behavior of the network is going to be unpredictable. Next slide, please. So what's in the current draft? we define the correct way to send MPTRVs, need to include a key. The definition of the key is You specific to each TLV type, and we gave we filled in the example of what the key should be for neighboring prefixes. It also discusses the received behavior if you receive a multiprotocol, or a multipart DLV. you're supposed to use all the information, not not choose between one TLV at another, the order in which the information arrives Timewise does not matter. the location of the information, whether one TLVs and LSP number 1, and one's in LSP number 100 makes no difference. You just all have to concatenate all this information internally and use it to fully describe the object. We do recommend that implementation supported knobs to control enablement and disablements of the use of MPTLV This is as a need to the operator so that if you have a deployment and you know that all the nodes in the network don't support MP for particular TLV. You You can control whether it's used or not. And we also recommend that implementation log occurrences, things like I've got MP disabled, and I received an MPTLV."

Next slide, The other thing that's again, this was added in the latest version There's a lot of discussion that the current specifications don't clearly indicate which TLVs MP can apply to. So we decided to we we scrubbed all of the existing INNA registries related to code points, And we are asking Ayanat at another column to indicate whether NP applies. to that TLV. and we've updated all of the existing code points as to what the initial values should be. And then going forward, any new code points to which MP could possibly apply. This will be part of what they have to specify when they specify their entry in the Ayanna registries, means we'll never be back in the situation where you have a TLD and nobody actually clearly specified whether MP applies or not. This, of course, does not mean just because MP applies to LTLV. doesn't mean that you're going to have deployments that need it We can certainly use the examples of neighbor and prefixes. The neighbor and prefix TLVs were invented 20 years ago. We've spent a long time without coming into the situation where we needed to advertise more than 35 bytes. but we are here now because of the addition of of new features to the protocol."

This is not an option if you If you're going to deploy, for example, enough flex algorithms with enough attributes that need to be advertised. you're going to have advertised more than 255 bytes. or your network is not going to work. So isn't a choice like, well, maybe I'll send multiple DLVs maybe I won't. Based upon the features that you're deploying, You're you're gonna have to do it. But, again, we do acknowledge that if you have a network where not all of the nodes in the network support MPTLV for a given TLV that It's not safe to introduce configurations which are going to require more than 25 to 55 bytes to be sent. There's been a lot of discussion about backwards compatibility Obviously, if you introduce this into an existing network and not all the nodes support MP for for a given TLV. The behavior of the network is is going to be unpredictable. wouldn't it be nice if we could somehow migrate Uh-uh. But, Unfortunately, it's not possible in this situation. Backwards compatibility can can be done when you're introducing new information that you're going to advertise So the legacy notes, They don't use the new information. They don't have that they don't need to parse it. They can just ignore it. And that's been the tradition in the protocol. But in this case, we are not introducing any new information. We simply have"

There's no way to introduce this And, remain backwards compatible. because the nodes that don't understand. don't support MPTLV for that TLV still need to access the information. that you're advertising. So I'd love to be able to to put forth a proposal that that allows backwards compatibility, but it's logically not possible in this case. Next slide, please. So There have been some there's There's been a lot of discussion over the past year about this. have been at least a couple of proposals that have come forward One of them is is introduces a container TLV, that says, well, When you get to more than 255 bytes, you take the extra bite put them inside a container Tlv, container tail. He is just a wrapper. you indicate which TLV you are extending, if you will, and you put the additional information in there. authors claim that this can be deployed incrementally, but this is not true. Again, You have legacy nodes? they are not going to understand The new TLV the container Tlv any more than they support MPTLVs. but they still need to use the information. that's inside that container. So this doesn't actually help. Next slide. There's sort of a a derivative of this proposal that suggests that Well, if we have a new TLD,"

So once you get past 255, you no longer send the original neighbor TLV, for example, put all of this into this new TLV. this has exactly the same problems. But as the the original container proposal. Nobody in the network today supports the container. So The effect of doing this is essentially say, well, when I get to more than 255 bites, I'm just going to stop advertising the neighbor. a traditional way, parts parts parts the prefix or whatever? And we're gonna put it in some new TLV that nobody today understands. then I'm gonna have to figure out how I can you'll move forward, You wait until all the nodes in the network support this new TLV, introduces a number of challenges, but the key point I wanna make here it doesn't make life any easier in the network. So it doesn't really help. Next slide. Alright. What are the next steps? We'd like to see the MPTLE draft be adopted as a working group document as is. yet, I'd like to emphasize, this is not something that's happening in the future. this is something that's happening today. There are existing deployments where we need actually are sending more than 255 bytes. So this is not something that we can delay and plan in a few years' time, make sure we're prepared. We actually have to deal with this now. there is there has been a discussion as I've mentioned before about"

We need to move forward. with the MPTLV, and whether this additional advertisement whether it's feature supported or capability, whatever we end up calling it. There's a lot of other considerations beyond just the nptld. I think it deserves a separate discussion on its own. And with that, How about it? Okay. So I think I'm I I don't like this. I think it's pretty obvious from what this is a as a working group member, not as a chair. I mean, there's we were doing greenfield development, we would never come up with a solution like this. we would have something that work better than this. I'll I kinda liked the big TLV container, but I I think that It's not doable. I think that Yeah. think that this is gonna be the solution ends up winning, but that that's as a working group member. I what I wonder if Did you not support wide metrics? It's a trick question, by the way. So should I let you continue? Yeah. I I it's no.

That's not the problem that we have here. Mhmm. problem here is we've got a bunch of information. that nodes today already support and they need to support their features, and we just get so much content that we can't fit it into a single TLB. I I think that's equivalent to a metric it's wider than what's supported? No. Yeah. Okay. Anyway okay. So like I said, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna stick stick stick to my guns on this one. I'll give up. Yeah. Okay. So that's all I needed to say. And I think WEMO is next. I think for the backward Yeah. backward compatibility, and the incremental deployment Price, for a pose idea we choose using or combining capability, with congenital of these. Those proposal is by quarter compatible and also we can deploy the feature, implementally. I think Chris explained that in detail in the mailing list. So if you look at the email thread, you'll see the and I had a lively discussion about that, and I responded to all the points. You can agree with him or you can agree with me, but The key element here is that If you introduce a new advertisement, whether it's the container TLV and or a capability, Nobody today. supports either one."

There is no backwards compatibility here. So we just put this into the email. or simple. So right now, every everyone with a legacy Evanos, Runs not negative. Right? And then we have a new information And then these new information, new loads, For example, we set we say these new nodes support these new features. You know so include those new information, And then we distribute that one with the capability. Those old node legacy note, just ignore that one. Right? And then the new nodes and nodes that some nodes don't support because we have really is. So and then we just don't use the new information. sorry. As long as those ever know the supported capability, and then happy, and then that's a backup compatible. Right? No. No. What you're saying is once all the nodes support whatever new form of advertisement, everything will be wonderful. With that You're you're starting over again. And the problem is that the leg what we're calling legacy nodes Need the information. that we're advertising, not just the first 255 bytes. But all 300 or how however much it is. What are you talking about is is in first formation. impulsive permission. but we are talking about the impossible mission, like, what are compatible. then maybe we can define what's backward compatible, and then with discuss us from there.

At the risk of AC Lendon, at the speaking as a working to pursue. per sip, participant at the risk of showing my ignorance of ISIS I'm gonna say that if we know we're not gonna have a functional capability OSPFS, RC7770 has informational capability base.

I got 11 others Are you done? question quick question. Well, okay. Again, I think there's a legitimate discussion that we had about whether you want to advertise I prefer to call it feature support, but let's not argue about the name. but that's a separate discussion. not going to change the fact Okay. It is that today, you need to send more than 255 bytes Yeah. And no matter how No. I I agree. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

So when c comes up, B and E use old LSA's of c in the as soon as b brings up the adjacency with c, they just download the route to point towards see because they use the old LSA's of c and assume that c has brought up the adjacency with b that that, you know, they assume that the backlink check in the SPF passes for b when b to c, adjacency comes up. So this this is the problem which which causes black holeing because c has not yet product with a just it's a just in season has not downloaded routes. its in its forwarding table. So if b forwards traffic to c, it might it might drop the traffic Yeah. That's exactly what we discussed. So this proposed solution here is changes are to be done on the neighbors of the restarting router. So there is the neighbor of the restarting router, they hold the adjacency bring up procedure until"

So Here, the c is the restarting router, and e is the neighbor.

Here, y was the is the stale LSA, which which is left out in ease database from its previous incarnation. So as a response to this DB database exchange message c cents and a list request with sequence number y, and On e, there is a modified procedure. So e sends an analyst request for that LSA. with origin c and sequence number x. So when it receives the so if you can see the next step, LSA a with origin c and sequence number x is being received from c, but it doesn't mark the l the LS request as satisfied. it holds the list request so that it doesn't bring up that adjacency.

Okay. how long you want to hold down the adjacency. But I see it basically equivalent to the fact that you don't bring up full until you've wrote all your LSA into your local data base, right, which seems trivial, but let's assume the study is slow or, you know, persistent something, and then you you would also hold down the adjacency until you've wrote through your database."

So I agree with everything that has been presented. I have a question and the solution that has been proposed been proposed for LSA's that the restarting router wants to generate after the restart. There can be a case where the restarting route may not want to generate certain LLSA after the restart. For example, it doesn't want to generate some redistributed prefix or so Do we want to address that problem as well? I think it is doable. Yeah. I have to think through it. I think it should it will be good if we can include that. I think we can solve it. Yeah. Yes. That's a AC LINDM. That's a good one. I'm trying to figure out how that would cause a problem. But we we because know, the problem is if you don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Bring up an adjacency. I mean, if you don't advertise a full adjacency when it's you know, you reuse the router at if you don't reuse that router LSA that's stale, it should prevent any other stale LSA's from being used. Maybe I'm missing something, though. I guess it depends on the order, how you know, generate your updated LSA and flash the LSA that you don't want to generate. you if the order is not right, then you can lose some traffic or loop if some some other router advertises the prefix that you don't want to.

This would be has been presented several times. what we do, we describe how we can announce the unreachable prefix in IGPs, We use mostly existing protocol mechanisms and we want to keep it backward compatible. That is very crucial here. So just a summary, what we do we rely on the metric being set to a value which is defined by either ISIS or how SPFS unreachable, This allows us to deploy the solution incrementally. there has been concerns that even if you generate and the prefix with astigmatric. it may be generated for some other purpose So if we want to distinguish this other purpose from what we want to do, We put some specific flags And, actually, 2 of them, you and u p flags, basically distinguish The reason why we generate this highmetric prefix from other reasons.

So a couple of changes that we introduced Basically, in Ospfv2, we have to advertise these new flags in a different LSA because we have no way of adding them into the original on extended pallet sales. So what we added in the text, we always said we to advertise the prefix is unreachable metric. plus, you can use this this newly defined flags. unfortunately, no SPF, these are in the do 2 different LSA. So what we added the a clarification in the latest version is that even if you advertise this flag, in OSBV 2, you still need to advertise the prefix in the, you know, old fashioned with the as infinity metric. Next one. And in OSBavis 3, AC made a comment last time that it would be good if we can use the a new bit. So we added the a new bit as a condition. So when we advertise those flags, we also set the metric dual as infinity, and we also set the a new bit because the LS infinity has not been defined for all the prefix types. So we can use the new bit, which has been defined for all of them. we kept PLSinfinity there just to be you know, consistent with the Ospav2. We also specify that 4 default algorithm 0 prefixesdlsinfinity and the NU bit must be set in the prefix DLV. and the the parent 1 and the original one and for the IP algorithm, we set it in the the current TLV.

We can compare between the traditional method, which is filling advertisements, which is around 8 by times 20 times 300. versus this method. The current draft is only 11 byte time strategy because we only advertise offset. So you see the increment compare is 185% versus 0.85 percent increase. What does it mean?

I was gonna say, this is another kiss opportunity, I think. Right? Like, this is a really specific complex solution. I think you need to be more general. The other thing I was gonna say is I don't know where you're from, but in Michigan, we have this saying that if you don't like the weather, stick around a few minutes. So that might not have been the best I guess, thing, the example. I guess I'm up. AC Lindham, again, speaking as a working group member. The first thing I I'm gonna say, is specific to the draft. OSVF does not have a way to use a metric, to say a link is down. an infinite. So you we you'd need explicit signaling I mean, you need a a flag or something to say it say it's down. ISIS does ospf. doesn't agree number. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other the other thing and and this relates to what they're saying. I mean, This is more there's different ways you can do this, and this this way of doing it, having all the routers doing these actions independently it's more fragile. So there'd have to be a a real it's more complex, and it's more fragile than sticking with something simpler. the other one. So you'd have to tell how this is gonna be better by doing that.

Actually, you need clock synchronizations. with all the nodes. Otherwise, we will apply in the routing loops. which is easy to have. Right?

So but then once you use source routing, the kind of methods, then you're running into this kind of situation or race conditions. I mean, packet be dropped in the middle. once you do the source routing. So that's my comment. Yeah. A lot of work related to be done because I'm gonna synchronize the clock on everyone else.
