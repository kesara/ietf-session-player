    "text": "use something like the encompassing semantics or certificates in other words where you think about telephone number allocation right there\u0027s big blocks of telephone numbers we want to be able to delegate down okay this carrier has this huge block they delegate maybe a hundred numbers to an enterprise and that enterprise may delegate a single number down to a telephone which it will then use that cert to sign telephone calls soon without being spoofed because of that we want to actually be able to use Acme to ask for CI Sert\u0027s Sert\u0027s with a CA bullion equal to true so that when that enterprise gets their initial cert allocation from acme they will be able to delegate down themselves an individual certificate to a particular single telephone number user I could have asked I asked Richard Barnes about this was like does Acme like work with this and he\u0027s like probably I mean again just put it in the CSRs table and it\u0027s true and it should should work so but if anybody wants to barf on that this would be a good time um we we think it\u0027s cool for our use case but I don\u0027t see anybody barfing I see some thumbs up in the crowd okay I think those the only thing was like really like interesting or controversial potentially in this and that needs to be reflected in the ATC element so that has its own internal boolean because you do want the token Authority who is telling the CH to issue the certificate to know you were asking for one with DC a boolean equal to true they might not like that that is basically a policy engine for this so we put that in we also added some minimal ionic considerations because we basically had nothing before next slide is there a stirrup owned of name constraints so the way that we\u0027re doing this in this is very similar to rpki we really did kind of quit from this I mean the thing is the Tia Nautilus or so there in the search there\u0027s this this new element we define that\u0027s called Tia NOC list and that\u0027s where you would stick those telephone numbers in fact that we were saying is that is the name constraints when we first looked at this we were like should we have like a separate like TN constraints element that is adjacent to that but ultimately I think the same way rpki encompassing works it seems like the you know if you get this you know thousand block from your carrier and your stop going down a hundred block well it is the thing that said you have a thousand block is the constraint that says you\u0027re allowed to issue the hundred block and then in turn it is the constraint if that\u0027s a shooing down a single number to some other entity so it\u0027s easy to seem redundant to actually just do like 50 to 80 well so we have verification services required to enforce it that\u0027s so we\u0027re going to do it in stir is that it we are pushing it to the relying parties and that\u0027s a you know I mean there there are edges that are hard edges on this actually in the way that telephone number allocation works because there are weirdnesses about numbering plans and things like that so it requires the verification service to have a certain amount of domain expertise in how number allocation works we think that in this use case we can we can assume that but you know I I you hear the tenuousness in "
