    "text": "information great so now I\u0027m going to talk about ITF and its related organizations I will give you a quick overview of the structure of the IETF and the main groups and organizations that are a part of this IETF ecosystem great so first and foremost what is the mission of ITF and I\u0027m supposed to read it loud so the mission of the IETF is to make the internet work better by producing high-quality relevant technical documents that influence the way people design use and manage the Internet so basically this means the purpose of the IETF is defined as follows first to develop and maintain the standards for technologies that are used to provide Internet services or to provide services over the Internet then functionality the mission of IETF is to ensure that the technology can that we provide can perform needed functions scalability to ensure that the technology will support the proper scale of deployment and usage another important point is security we want to ensure that the technology itself is secure and can be securely operated and can be operated securely and then easy deployment we want to make sure that the technology can be easily and effectively in short standards and technologies developed at the IETF is secure scalable and can be deployed effectively so let\u0027s talk about what how is IETF we understand ITF is a standards development organization and it\u0027s a little different than other standards development organizations that you might have encountered at the IETF people participate as individuals there is no formal membership it\u0027s a voluntarily voluntary participation whereas other standard development organizations typically have membership of some form it\u0027s really individual based whereas ITF is individual participation secondly at the IETF we do not have any formal voting system we have a very informal consensus based voting which we call hum and we get back to that later in this tutorial whereas other stos others are other development organized sort other development standard development organizations typically have some form of formal voting so our IDF is very different in that "

    "text": "of the major features of IETF as stated in its original mantra which says that we reject Kings presidents and voting we believe in rough consensus and running code so basically the idea is to reject maturity ruling at ITF rough consensus is really an interesting concept it doesn\u0027t necessarily mean everyone agrees in the end it also does not it is also not necessarily a compromise so rough consensus is reached when all concerns and issues are heard and addressed they are not necessarily all have to be accommodated as long as everyone can live with the outcome at the working group sessions there\u0027s always a session chair who is responsible and some you seem to be muted can you please reenable your microphone okay can you hear me now yes okay so I was saying that the session sorry for the interruption the session chair at the working group is responsible to lead the discussion on a particular topic and make sure that all the dissenting opinions are heard but these opinions should not be the controlling voice so what we do is we measure consensus by humming humming is just a hum like hmm it\u0027s it\u0027s a good way to you know feel the temperature of the room and it is more importantly it is anonymous so no when some people are not comfortable raising their hands or coming out expressing their opinion where humming is kind of an anonymous way of getting them to would this mean nobody has to raise their hand in order to make their choice no it\u0027s also important to know that a consensus call is usually carried over to the mailing list and it is basically repeated on the mailing list and this is important because not everybody can attend variety of meetings in person but they should also be heard "
