    "text": "good afternoon everyone had I known I was the only agenda item I maybe would have proposed to cancel the meeting but here we are uh so um the the online meetings draft is through the working group last call but I was going to do an editorial pass on it and then like I think it's kind of caught halfway between being a historical record of our pandemic experience and like uh recommended best practices going forward and it's listed informational draft so um like how should it be written is it is it a is it primarily a like a BCP that has some informational background or is an informational document with someone like here's some things you might want to try and it's like BCP the appropriate if it's currently informational is BCP the current proper status like how should we shade the the content um last second I'm not going to let you change the status either okay so um it stays well it's an information document that got accepted and um let's keep it as such I would say unless you strongly object or anybody else strongly attracts because I don't mean it seems well I know I don't really care super strongly but do you um well enough to have this have this uh agenda item but um I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like a bonus higher for BCP than for an information sorry that was inappropriate but so I I don't think it in in practice it doesn't matter right um also because I think we found with a lot of these documents that that we've written right that the lessons from the pandemic have shown us that they sort of apply in general but maybe the aspiration of having BCP level guidance is a bit too strong because you know things didn't develop quite as we planned and we learn"

    "text": "all these things because it's the first pandemic that any of us has been in right so so you can make it PCP because the other ones were BCP I think it's still more of an informational thing anyway sure and and to be clear like there are parts of that draft that have never been field tested like the scheduling algorithm so uh fair enough uh Lars before you run off um uh is it okay if you like editorally or just sort of written like a BCP like with 2119 words Etc that is fine for me as an 80 if you want if you think they make the document clearer I don't I don't mind leaving them in okay hotels yeah Charles eckel so you know I definitely think we we learned some valuable things going through this and so to the extent the document can can capture those and share not just exactly what happened but kind of where we currently are um I think like like what was mentioned the the thought of hey we we actually remote participation is working really well and with that people might choose to only go to two meetings in person out of the three but the ietf isn't you know at this time deciding to make one a forest virtual for everyone you know so I think some of those types of thinking that type of thinking I think came out of our experience so it would be I think the document right now kind of is on the the fence it kind of gives some some guidance for how you might want to do things and then it also in some cases as you were mentioning it just says this is sort of what happened and that guidance and that learning is important I think so I'd like us to capture it if it's informational then hopefully that's not uh too controversial okay so I think what I'm hearing is go ahead and do that Martin uh do this editorial passes informational um it will be like the pr will be a lot of words but um we'll not have any substantive change"
