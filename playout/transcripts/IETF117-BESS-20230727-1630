I figured I'd use this microphone that way people can kind of actually see me when I'm talking to you because otherwise, I kind of feel like I'm not talking to you. one of the things that I've noticed about a lot of the documents concerns document quality. These documents are very complex, and Some of the time, you're picking up, you know, grammatical errors etcetera, and I'm not blaming people for that. There are non native English speakers, etcetera. but it does mean that the reviews are taking a lot longer. I've had one particular document, which was not a terribly long document where I found 87 grammatical errors in them, and some of them were pretty consequential making the document you know, fairly difficult to understand. what I'm gonna say is that we need to do something about the quality of the text in the documents, implementation is you know, the the the technical side of the documents is often not the problem. it's the general quality of the text. And there are a couple of ways that we can look at fixing this, but I do think that it does need to be fixed because what's gonna start happening You know, in conversations with the other routing ABs, going to start pushing documents back when we get to the first couple of pages and go, you know, this clearly hasn't been reviewed enough that it is ready to be passed forward.

Doesn't happen often, but it has happened, not their fault. very technical document. So I think that having a group of people who are prepared to step up step up and review those documents before working group last call to sort out the grammar and the spelling and the rest of it. would certainly make documents go through the queue along faster, which I think is in everybody's interests. Because if you look at the agenda on this meeting, are a huge number of documents and we've really gotta get the document quality up a lot more than it is at the moment. So I just wanted to say that to the working group, and, you know, Matthew can talk further about how we create some kind of a review team or something But please, guys, the the quality of the text right now on the documents is just not up to scratch. it's gotta be fixed. So Indeed. One of the one of the the things I was thinking about is that there's been precedent in other working groups. One of for having a working group review team. for drafts, and it didn't necessarily it wasn't necessarily limited to those who are currently active in the working group. so that I I I don't know if lower recalls or can say anything about this.

So I are we asking because there is a routing working group, directorate review, where the the chairs can asked for the review from them. So this is something in addition to that. So the director does a good job. Don't get me wrong. remember something that the director is reviewing a lot of documents from all over the place, and we are using them. but things get missed. And I think that in the case of where you've got this many documents coming out of a working group. it's probably good to have a multi person team that is looking at these documents with a sole focus on fixing those issues So directorate will still be there to look for other issues, but I think we need to go wider in the case of BEST because of the numbers of documents and what we've been seeing coming out of here.

The idea was that you know, you could have in your network virtual private network that spans multiple domains. Like, in this example, you can CE 1 and CE 2. They are connected to the same layer 3 VPN. but their ps are actually in different domains. So you got p 1 in an EDPM domain. p 2. on an IP VPN domain"

So the the ideas, there was, you know, the needs to specify how to stitch in these domains with the the use of service gateways. right, a gateways where you instantiate an IP verve, and then you need to specify certain procedures for pad selection, loop prevention, path attribute propagation, and route aggregation. One of the interesting things in this draft is the definition of a new attribute called DeepaaS. which is defined as optional transitive And it's really a sequence of domain segments, which, you know, each domain segment is has a length and a value. And the value is really a sequence of domains with the the format that you have in the on the screen domain ID and sanphy time. a little bit more details about this d path. So whenever you have these domains, and you are stitching them with using, you know, service gateways. each domain will have a domain ID. like, the ones you have on the on the screen. So 65 1001, 65,002, etcetera. So that is kind of the information that the path conveys. Right? So what Deepast does is to provide an end to end visibility of all the domain IDs through which a given route has gone And here you have an example where p 2 is advertising at about type 5, and then that gets to the service gateways. The service gateways are really distributing that route in IPGPN, attaching this t path with the information of the domain ID of origin and also the the saffy type. So when that gets to the adjacent service gateway, the service gateways will append the the latest domain. ID and so on and so forth. So DeepPath is used in this way"

So in this example, let's say p 1 21 gets the Rotay 5 directly and also gets the route and the same route, through IPVPN with the domain and a d path. Basically, it'll select the the direct one coming from p 2, because it has a shorter shorter d pass. The other thing is the the gateways must not sport around that contains a local domain IT. Right. Right. Right. Alright. So history of distress, initially, the document was originated based on the instance among vendors and operators to merge a couple of drafts. The result of the merge was presented multiple times. here at the IETF. It was adopted in in 2019. We got another reallocation for the d pass attribute. and it has been implemented by multiple vendors. as far as I know, there are at least 4 implementations of this draft. and it has been even publicly proven the interoperability. So here, you have a link to the EINTC test report in 2022. where you can see clearly that the path was tested So the document went to last call in November 2020 and sent to IDR chairs for review. and and here, basically, the IVR chairs raised several issues. And I really want to to thank publicly Sue and Jeff you know, for all the time they spent on this document. So the the main outstanding concerns after addressing some other issues were the you know, related to the path And I'm quoting here the IDR chairs.

So basically, because of that, in revision 8, We discussed a lot among the authors, and, you know, DeepAT was previously supported for SAPI 1 routes. so the routes that go into the Internet. And there were certainly some risks associated to it. But to be honest, we didn't have a use case for the use of Deepa in Safi 1. So the only reason why we added it in the first place. It was because it was a nice thing to to do. But given all the risks, we decided to remove support for Safi One route along with the path. a result, we changed the normative language, and and and you have some changes that you can easily review in the diff of the document. So, yeah, you can see all the all these points, but for the sake of time. Basically, the other thing that we did is to to spend the security considerations section quite a bit. And we also addressed John's comments on the on the mailing list. So thank you, John, for for all those very good comments. And the the last thing is that we well, yesterday, we had a a meeting with Jeff and we kind of agree on the a path forward.

Very quick update on this draft, EVPM, VPWS gateway. I'll talk about a short refresh. changes in the latest solution and next steps So what is this about? It's really for evpnvpWServices. where you need to cross multiple domains and even encapsulations. Again, the example would be suppose you have CE 1a and coneb, and they are attached to the same VPWS service. but their keys are in different domains with different encapsulations. Typical use cases, the main one is SRMPLS, domain 2 is a service 6. So what this document is doing is one of the approaches to solve this issue is to have a service gateway. between the domains, right, to to stitch of those services together. And because of that, you need to specify the procedures for, you know, processing the the 80 per EVA routes on the boarding routers and really you know, to re advertise the route as well and to to program the fall in state. And the other thing that the traffic is covering is redundancy. Of course, you need a gateway redundancy. There are two mechanisms defined, and we are bringing here the use of also depath with these AD per EVA routes to avoid loops"

So what we are seeing, you know, after tucking customers is that There are a few challenges in very large data centers. So the first challenge is the control pain scale. So we are talking here about 100 of Ethernet segments per leave. and those ends of, you know, broadcast domains periphery from a segment that translates into 1000 of 80 per EVA routes And as a result of that, of course, you need to advertise those routes. you need to process them, and that creates some overhead. In some chipsets also, because you need to create or and program these overlay ACM p sets that also sometimes create some complexity. And, also, there is some inefficient forwarding during the failure mostly because of this leafspine architecture here. So because of these problems, some some people or some customers, they prefer to stick to proprietary MCLAC solutions make use of any CASV tips. Right? So what we want to do here is to basically give an answer to those customers that are seeing these these problems. with a and standard based EVPN solution. the the example or the inefficient forwarding that I was talking about earlier is is basically he lost rated here in this diagram."

Whereas if you use use something like a NenikasVita, in flight packets on the spine 1. They can go directly to leaf 2 and ts 1. that that is what I was talking about. Alright. So how do we solve this, or this is the proposal. We need 2 small extensions the first one is a flag. in the ESI label extend the community. That new flag is called any cast areas in mode, and can be 1 or 0. So when you set this this bet, It means that you are working on this Any CAS areas in mode. The other thing or the other extension is we need 2 and encode a new any gas vtip address. So this is just a loop back shared among NVEs that are attached the same Ethernet segment. And this is verb I suppose to the any gas VTech, which is the the unique loop back as a appreciated to each NV writing. each network virtualization edge device. So we are encoding the sendingcast VTech in the PGP tunnel encapsulation attribute on the tunnel egressendpoints TLV. and the any kind of VTech only goes there. It's never encoded as an NLRI next That's a a key thing. And this attribute this Nica's VTech address is advertised along with the EVPN AD per EES route. for the Ethernet segment.

And, also, we are only using this in the case of the egress MVEs using the same DNA or label. is typically the case in data centers because you use global VNIs. Okay?

So what we do is on the egress and these, They are configured in this new mode. Okay? And we allocate this any guy's VTech address. Now the Enikas Vitted has to be also advertising the or PGP. Right? And now we are suppressing the advertisement of the 80 per EVA routes. So now in in case of an Ethernet segment link failure, removes on the underlay. and also, as usual, the 80 per year route and the ES routes are withdrawn. Okay? Okay? What do we do on the ingress MVE? So Upon receiving their MAC IP route with the Ethernet segment. Basically, we program the MAC with the destination equal at least on the segment. which is now resolved to this new Anycast Vtip address. Okay. Okay. Now in current frames, they are encapsulated using in let's say, we use the XN. So now the outer IP destination address is the the Eni class Vtip. Okay?

The second scenario takes the level level of granularity to one level lower, and it says for a given bridge domain, you can have a leaf or root on a pair attachment circuit. So a given PE can have both leaf and root attachment circuits for the same broadcast format. And then The 3rd scenario even takes it one level further and says, you can have a leaf and rooting on a third MAC address. So The third one, although we don't see that many we don't you know, we haven't come across the requirement from customer to support the 3rd but the 1 and 2 are becoming very prominent. and this draft talks about changes and the clarifications that we did for the 12. So I'll start with the clarification. in the baseline draft, we talk about the root and leaf in context of the EVI and to be more precise, it is in context of the bridge domain.

And on a per broadcast from ambitious. And We had the option to use 2 raw targets to of to do that. That was a, like, a the primary that was The backup option, the main option was just to use a single RT. And it turned out that the 2 RT solution has a issue and doesn't support EVP And Mobility. And so We got rid of the 2 RT option, and It is not the baseline the main option that we indicated using a single route Marga, And for this scenario, the ingress the filtering for the non unicast route is done on the ingress as we had it in the Base lane RFC.

And to do these adaptive ingress filtering, we use the I'm at route to indicate for a given broadcast domain whether that broadcast domain has only leaf ACs or root ACs or a combination listen root ACs. And when you send this advertisement, on the receive side, when the receive p gets it, then it can create to replication list. And the one that can go everywhere, and then the other one can go to all the PEs, but the PEs which are on the leave. In other words, the other replication list goes to the PEs that are root or root plus swift. And once you have that, once you have these 2 replication lists, then you can do all these adaptive stuff very easily.

If there are only root ACs and no leaf, Still, you don't advertise it because root AC is just Yeva as a regular EVP. root PEs just behave as a regular EVP and PEs. However, once you add the leaf AC, then you set the leaf flag, and then you send the VNI associated with the leaf. that are you indicate that this leaf indication for is for this VNI. And when both root and leaf are set, Same thing. And then this next table shows that when you use the 2 when between the two collater lists that you have, when you use the first one and then you use the second one.

I'm presenting this draft on behalf of the officers. So the list is there. So so sorry. I'm presenting an update on the draft. Right? The draft was originally presented at the IETf109online in November 2020, so almost 3 years ago. The draft is about using SR to to deliver and optimize what we call optimize in and service. with data payment cloning. So the idea here is that what the draft is proposing is maintaining the semantics of the Sudwar. However, solving the basic issue was a Sudoval. So Sudhuar, historically, has been with the label of the pseudo art historically have been presenting 2 piece of information. which is the endpoint and the soaps. So because of that, we had issues with scale in Sudhwar in general. and all sort of issues in deploy deploying Sudwar in large scale network and so on, and and control plane associated with setting up SUDOR.

So one, which you call the service set, and one which is which presents the endpoint where the Soudoir is ending. the 2 end point of Sudwater. We as well propose in the draft a way of achieving functionality like active, active. Because pseudo watch, for example, historically has not been doing any active active redundancy, or allowing any multi passings, the core of the network was, you know, layer 2 hates, you know, active, active redundancy. and and try to block any redundant pass on the network. So that draft side. Okay. Hey. I'm gonna bring as well to the Soudoir world, the active active redundancy, and I'm gonna do that using what we call an any casket. The Anycast said here is presenting is the access ESI where we are providing as the access is a multi home. Right? So that Anycast is presenting an ESI. and we can if if the endpoint is in any cache, then it is presented by the multiple provider, edges that are attached to that multi home site. And of course, as I already explained, improve on Soudoir scale because by splitting the servers from the endpoint, Now we don't need the huge amount of control planes that baggage that we have to carry to signal all those Soudhwas, So so we're giving a simple example. If I have 10,000 service, you know, with 1000 point, we only need to communicate the 10,000 servers. So simplifies the control plane greatly, we have a mechanism by which even each service in control plane can be presented by a bit to say was that he has a service enabled or not."

And the good thing about Zenie has, just to make sure everyone is aware of it, is that when you use anycast to present an ESI, we change the convergence problem. from being an overlay problem, to become an underlay. Right? So once you're underlay converged, you don't need to converge your overlay. There is no need. to implement any overlay conversions.

So here, the host is attached to the p e 1 and where we are enable the the DHCP snooping. So after the DHCP, the Dora exchange is complete, Right? So DHCP snoop route is getting our now as a part of this JCPsnewproud,"

Now once this is advertised to the RR, the RR is going to just send it transparently. to the b 2. Now p 2, you know, this route get installed in the DHCP snoop database. Now here, it has to calculate the least time. So it checks the create time. on that p 2. And current time on the p 2 and the create time and whatever is the difference then, you know, it is going to subtract that from the from the lease time. I think the next examples will make it a bit more clear. Right? Let's say the p 3 joins the fabric, you know, after, let's say, after 4 hours. then the route reflector is going to send this route as is. So that way, on p 3, it checks the current timestamp and identifies that, oh, okay. whatever the received, create time, and the the current time timestamp, so there is a difference of 4 hours. then that it is going to subtract from the least time, the 10 hours and minus the 4. So 6 hours is what it is going to start the the least time far. So with this method, right, so the RRs are transparently sending the updates. And only on the VTech where we have the DHCP enabled. Data is not enabled, it gets updated. So the draft also talks to come, you know, deeply about the services and multi home services and the bridge services in detail, that I'm not covering it here.

So welcome to the first non EVPM presentation of the day. So here, we're just going to talk about BGP MPLSnamespaces and actually one application of it. for option c, labels both in security. So we presented it first in 2021, just say what the changes to the draft. simple recap of the problem statement and describe the use case. So there are some edit editorial changes. the IND code for the AFI has been located. and we just added this illustration of the option c labels spoofing. support and added callers welcome callers So the problem statement itself is that This provides basically, it provides upstream allocation for MPLS labels using an L3PN like family. where the fact is not an IP prefix, but just an MPLS label. And one of the applications of it is to improve interiors option c solution. where we can provide better scaling. because we don't have to expose all the p loopbacks network wide. which provides quicker end to end convergence. because BCP pick and egress protection, like, features can now work on MPLS namespace labels instead of IP prefixes and it's doing prefixes. And the the changes are confined to the ASBRs, all the regional hours. So legacy piece can enjoy the benefit. of better scaling And have security against labels moving. that is what we are gonna cover in the session, how that works."

    "startTime": "01:28:02",
    "text": "So here, we have example, option c, topology, where a s 1 is on a trusted Jio. but AS2 is an untrusted deal. So, usually, option c is but domains are controlled by the same administrator. But because of geopolitical reasons, it may be that some of the regions hard in an untrusted view, and operators want to provide better security. for traffic that's coming from that other other domains. So we have a typical option scenario where ASBR 13, ASBR 14, in are in the trusted deal. p 11p12 are the p's. And here, we have an example where p 11 has, for example, both intra AS services and inter AS services. So the red VPN is, like, inter yes. It has been revised to the remote. but green VPN is like an intra AS service. and p 12 has only intra AS services. It does not have any exposure to AS2. So here, we're gonna see how do we protect traffic from AS2 such that we only accept traffic for the look back that have been advertised to the other AS, And we only only accept traffic for the VPNs that have been advertised for the For example, if the other AS guesses VPN, the label values, it's not able to inject traffic to the PEs or the VPNs inside this AS. So there are, like, two steps to the process. I'll just jump to the slide and come back to the so it's like a transport layer, label spoofing check. and service layer. labels proofing check. So, basically, the way it works is the traffic that's coming inbound is coming either directed to a directly connected interface, which is, like, on interface links or it is coming to a loopback. So we have transport layer inter labels moving check on the interface. So the interface that's coming from the other AS that is confined into as2.mpls. context. So that is a MPLS name space that we create for the transport layer label spoof check."

    "text": "So, basically, whatever labels that we are diarizing in BGPLU, like, transport layer protocols. Those, like, TL 1 is is installed inas2.mpls. And it points to another context that is created for p top11labels. That is service labels. So p 11 dotmpLS is the service plain MPLS label context. where we have the labels that are advertised by p 11 to the remote areas. So p 11 collects the context for p11.mpscallistacontxt4p11advisedlabels. And the the a s 2.mpLS just has a UHP label that is doing look up into the p 11 MPL. So this way, we are able to, for example, protect p 12 from being exposed to AS2. Because whatever traffic coming in, we'll be doing a lookup in a s 2 dot m p l s, which does not have a label for p 12. So it will automatically drop any traffic that other is trying to get to p 12. But and if there is a traffic that's coming with the AS ponelabel, it is having the green VPN label. then the p11.mpls does not have an entry for the green. So that way, we are having being able to support both the label stuck, the transport label as well as the service So for the transport label spoof check, actually, there is no extension required. because it is like a local thing. And this mechanism works the same way for transport labels in option c as well as service labels in option b. So service label option b scenario is already deployed. It's being used. So here, the transport label is using the interface based check, and then the service label is using the mechanism that is using the MPL's name space family. one thing I'm just mentioning here is in this diagram. So the way the new family that comes into play is basically, that family is used to mirror or install the labels that are advertised by p 11. to the ASBR, 13, ASBR 14."

Here is an example. at the top row, you can see that p 1 advertised, service prefix 1 with service label 100. now. the the routes are reenterprised along the ASPR since that was through the route reflexors, that are directly connect appearing with the PEs. So here, when ASPR 1, we advertise the routes for the ASPR 21. and it adds a label. 201, and then label 201 is bound to pone. and it also changes the next hop to ASPR 1. Now on ASPR 21, receive their route and reallocate towards the S 200 it it noticed that it already has 2 labels in the in the in the NRI. So it will changed the ink the received they go to 1. to a a locally allocated label to to where the 22 is is bound to the ASPR 1, comma, 201. So this goes on until it reaches p 3.

And then the next label is the 24 in the NROI and followed by the service label. And the more SBR 3 receives the track packet traffic, then it sees that, oh, the labeled 204 I know how to forward it, basically, it switches to swap the 24223 and then ton of the traffic to r22. The same thing goes on. So in summary, if you look at those those true labels, they are resolved from the received next up. then they just get the package for the next ASVR or next p The red labels are the first label in the received multi label in ROI. that's basically how how it works. In the draft, we talk about another option using tunnel encapsulated in in encapsulation attributes instead of using merchant label. So we and then later on, we realized that is this using multilabel in the MRI is actually a a probably a better way. because the the the p's do not need a new procedure as long as they can support label in the NROI dish dish should just work.
