This is a non-working group forming bomb We're not trying to design the protocol here today We're trying to decide whether we understand the problem and the IETF is the right place to work on it If the answer to both of those is yes, then we can move to working on a charter for next meeting This is the agenda we've laid out. The intent is to have discussions of the problem statement discussions of what a solution might look like and then a lot of open discussion We have tried to make lots of time to hear each other Then at the end, we'll try and answer those two questions All right, so let's, so let's and get started.

It's, we think it's currently at technology readiness level six So we're starting operational pilots now with certain parties, for example, with the safety children in South Sudan, and we're also working with the Japanese Red Cross on some use cases. So that's the background. And please, next slide I will get into, try to get you into the problem space. So what we try to do here is basically to prevent loss of lives in disaster and conflict areas around the globe because lack of information and I think Mike, the next speaker will have a perfect example of this lack of information leads to casualties and civilian harm In many cases, press medical workers, medical convoys, and so forth.

I will not go into details here but just to give you an impression of what we're the symbol and signs that we're currently digital with white flag Next one please so we're used to physical science but they have severe limitations They cannot selective B be shared. Often you want certain people to know that you're there, but you don't want others to know They're hard to authenticate, hard to see in many situations, but also hard to process by automated systems, and especially with intelligence systems becoming more available, it's very important that we take those into account as well. And last but not least, if something goes wrong accountability is very hard because it's hard to reconstruct what actually happened and what information was actually available at the time Next one, please So that's why we started working on what we called the was actually available at the time. Next one, please. So that's why we started working on what we call digital science and signals, but you can use the term digital emblems as well And on security having signs that are, you don't have to put on the object itself because it's digital, it can live somewhere else can be used real time to multiple stakeholders in the, in a selective way And you can support many types of objects physical like cars, vehicles, buildings, people but also virtual of course and events"

If we have different standards here to do this then we still not achieve what we need to achieve here And there is a diversity of use cases So even wen lin conflicts, one conflict is not the same as another conflict so science might be used differently in different conflicts but the use case of the let's say, in disaster areas, again, is different from use cases in conflict areas.

So when we talk about the slide that Tim will show about the sign that cannot be selectively share and so on So just to be precise, so we as the other humanitarian organization as the U.S other humanitarian underground, so there are different several ways to communicate the positions of our assets and our person So the first communication is through a reduction channel with the armed forces of both sides With email is another solution with direct contact with the command and control of the army.

The conference taking place about digital emblems is potentially of a enormous importance for the international news video from a safety perspective. I mean, as we understand, at the most basic level, we're talking about press signs that we velcro on our flack vests in war zones or the TV signs that, you know, we put on the sides of, and roofs of arm in cars and other vehicles that we use on in battlefronts and often with duct tape in the physical world Could you move to the next slide, please? please? Here's a real world example. You know, I could give you dozens like this I'm sorry, let me try Thank you a real world example. I could give you a dozen like this. In August 2005, the Reuters Bureau in Baghdad heard reports of an insurer attack on a police station and a US military checkpoint The insurgency in Iraq was escalating after the 2003 invasion and attacks like these were big news stories. So the Bureau sent driver Walid Khaled and TV cameraman Haida Kadam to the scenes report as they approached in their car. The car was unmarked, but the German journalists were wearing, you know, press badges on their flag fest and they had IDs as well, Reuters ideas and U.S. military IDs. But as they approached this checkpoint, the U.S. soldiers opened fire Waleed died. He was one of seven journalists that was lost in Iraq between 2003 and 203"

A digital version of this press badge, something as simple as what we put on up flak jackets, but a digital version of that could perhaps be seen or integrated into a battlefield GIS system and does proceed from a greater distance, maybe over the hill, at night It could have potentially have made a difference in this case and saved Walid's life. And as I say, I could give you dozens of examples of that Another way, you know, that potentially a digital emblem could be used to cover people is via vehicles. What you see here on the slide is an old Reuters Armored Land Rover nicknamed Tarzan by my colleagues at Bois Voyage's who used it mainly in the Middle East The vehicle has actually been donated to the Imperial War Museum in London, and it's now an exhibit, so if you're curious, you can have a look at it the next time you're there In August 2006 in Gaza, tarzan was struck by a missile fired from an israeli helicopter and despite the copious old-school physical emblems that you see on the vehicle there in the photo. Two of our colleagues were wounded a digitized version of the emblems could have been more visible and provided more protection Could you move to the next slide, please? There's another way in which this could be of enormous consequence and benefit to use me media. We carry a lot of equipment. TV equipment photo equipment, technology, communications gear, sap phones, starlings these days and personal protective equipment when we cross-border And the paperwork involved in managing cars sap phones, starlings these days, and personal protective equipment when we cross borders. And the paperwork involved in managing Carnays, export licenses, and other customs bureaucracy is a real nightmare for journalists. Journalists do not do bureaucracy particularly well"

In addition, to visuals, gear and PPE person protective equipment, the technology and logistics teams of a news agency like Roydus will have maybe a couple of tons of computers server equipment for the newsroom that we're going to establish in the main press center and for robotics that we put in the stadiums at the events it is not a unusual for photographers involved in robotics to arrive an event like this with 18 Pelican cases All of this pales in comparison to the amount of gear that a major rights-holding broadcasts like the BBC or NBC, has to bring in such events. Being able to replace, you know, folders full of customs-related paperwork, with a QR code maybe linking to information that can be, you know, detailed and updated on a laptop would free out so much help effort, time, and resources that we really want to spend on the news event itself. And also, you know, there are a lot of liability issues there connected to poorly filled in paperwork There are lots of other aspects, you know, of this discussion regarding journalist safety, media legitimacy"

Okay, thank you Next speaker While we're waiting for the next speaker to set up there are some slides have been sent to the mail list linked to them from Rohan who talked about his experiences dealing to some of this this So, first of all, thank you so much to all of you for this opportunity to be here.

And so I'll explain the digital side of it in a couple of minutes, but I really want to start with explaining what exactly the distinctive emblem is, because it is really something very unique very idiosyncratic so I really want everyone to kind of understand the breadth of this notion of the distinctive emblem. Next slide, please so this mosaic hopefully will give you a little bit of an introduction as to, like I said, the breadth of this concept of a distinctive And I'll say at the outset that the primary user of the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross, Crescent and Crescent so I say distinctive emblem because it's the distinctive emblem of the Geneva Conventions, the primary user is actually states, it's not the International Committee of the Red Cross or other components of the movement that I'll talk about later.

It doesn't signify their affiliation with any movement or their where they work or anything like that. It just signifies that they have specific protection The next image, the black and white image is an image from the landing on the beaches in Normandy, right, from the Second World War. And again, you see war surgeons bearing the Red Cross the distinctive emblem of the Geneva Conventions to identify the specific protections that they have You'll see that the emblem can be used on vehicles, it's used on ships it can be put on the top of hospitals, so military hospitals also civilian hospitals, and then it's also used by certain national societies. So here you see, I think it's the German Red Cross and the Turkish Red Crescent, the ICRC military hospitals also civilian hospitals and then it's also used by certain national societies so here you see i think it's the german red cross and the turkish red crescent the icerc uses the protective emblem at all times so you'll see the picture with the emblem at the top of our headquarters in Geneva. The bottom picture is how the ICRC uses, the bottom middle picture is how the ICRC uses the emblem on the field. This picture is kind of important to me because that's that's a picture of me in my past life when I worked on the field with the ICRC and I benefited from the specific protections that I'm talking about and so was entitled to use the Red Cross emblem Next slide. So I really want to just take maybe two minutes and oh sorry we can see this slide so this is just some information um kind of like giving you the breath of how the emblem is used. I mean, it's, you know, there's over 120 arm conflicts worldwide that involve over 60 states and 120 non-star armed group. So they're all entitled for their military medical military services civilian medical services, they're entitled to use the emblem, all parties to arm conflict. But maybe you can look at that information later because I really want to move to the next slide, which is explains what is so different about the emblem so when we think of a of an emblem we usually think of a logo right, or we think of something that provides some information about it"

And so you know that this object either belongs to Wayne Enterprise or are somehow related to Wayne Enterprises. If you see I don't know, an emblem of the radioactive symbol, then you know that whatever is inside of that thing, maybe is radioactive and it has to be treated in a specific way. But in any case, an emblem can be used to inform, provide some information of a affiliation. And the emblem is used that way as a logo. So it does have that function We call that in international law because that's how it's framed in international humanitarian law, an indicative use So indicative emblem is kind of like a fancy way of saying a logo essentially and so it it shows a affiliation with the movement. And in that way, it can be used primarily by what we call national societies, like the American Red Cross or the German Red Cross or the Turkish Red Crescent by the ICER and by the Federation. But what's more important particularly for this process of digitalizing the emblem is the protective use, right? So it's a completely different use the protective use of the emblem. And with the protective use of the emblem signals or indicates is actually not affiliation with any one or any state or any government or any enterprise or anything like. Doesn't indicate any kind of affiliation what it indicates is a specific protection in international humanitarian law and we and so for the medical services we call that protection respecting and protecting it's a positive obligation that parties to conflict have to treat the medical services in certain humanitarian operations in a search way. And so the ICRC uses the protective emblem at all times, what we call the international federal, of the Red Cross which I can explain that a bit later uses the protective emblem at all times. And then all of those images I show you earlier of the military using the emblem or the civilian hospital in times of armed conflict using the emblem. That is the protective use So a party to armed conflict, when they see that emblem, they have no idea what the affiliation is maybe it's a chaplain like a religious chaplain maybe it's the medical services maybe it's the ice ICRC, maybe it's the Federation, maybe it's the National Society using the emblem"

But what they know is that they have to act in a certain way. And in that sense, it's more like a stop sign or a traffic light What it indicates is a specific obligation of a party to conflict. And that part has to act in a certain way that is absolutely a not just, we cannot target this thing it's a positive obligation to respect and protect an obligation that has existed for 160 years and really form sort of the base of international humanitarian law If we look at the history of IHL, international humanitarian law, it really starts, as this idea that you have the medical services, you have medical funds basis of international humanitarian law. If we look at the history of IHL, international humanitarian law, it really started as this idea that you have the medical services, you have medical functions, and there has to be a way of identifying the specific protection of those medical functions, and then, of course, also search humanitarian functions. And that's so kind of a bit of a story of this notion of this protective use of the emblem And then the emblem also has a purpose that's related to this protected function, which is really to assist, right? Because the emblem also indicates to persons. Imagine you're in an armed conflict and you see, a red crescent or a red cross or a red crystal. You know that, you know, you don't know that that entity is necessarily the government or an arm group or the ICRC or the Federation or someone else, as I mentioned earlier But you know that if you go there, you might be protected. And in that sense, it's a bit like this emblem of a fire escape, right? So if you see a fire escape you know that if there's a fire you can go there and you're more likely to be safe And for a fire escape to work, there has to be very specific rules related to how that fire escape is used. How big is the emblem? Where is it placed? How many? of them are there? There are laws that control the different sort of dimensions of that album element. And the Red Cross, Crescent, and crystals are very much like that. So they're regulated by international humanitarian law and they themselves indicate a specific protection in international humanitarian law. So when we think about what might be orthogonal to this discussion, because that word might come up, when we think of what might be not related to discussion you have to think about a stop sign or a"

Okay so just very quickly now, because I only have about a minute what do we, you know, why are we at the IAT? So the reality is that today, cyber operations are part and parcel of armed conflict right? So parties to armed conflict engage in cyber operations against each other and sometimes even target civilian populations When international humanitarian law, was conceived, it was conceived with, there are medical services and there are searching humanitarian operations that must be respected and protected by parties to conflict All states of the world are party to the Geneva Convention, every single state is party to the Geneva Conventions. Every single state agreed that the medical services and searching humanitarian operations must be respected and protected. But there is no way of indicating that protection in cyberspace because when the Geneva Conventions were conceived, of course, there was no cyberspace And so the digital emblem project is seeking to take the distinctive emblem and reflect it in cyberspace that's it it's not trying to change the distinctive emblem. The distinctive emblem works. It's worked for 160 years We're not trying to change that And our goal today is to use the standardization process and to take a product and to bring it to states and say you need to incorporate this into international humanitarian law or adopt in a way that it can be used in situations for armed conflict to indicate these protections. Sorry, I went over time. Thank you very much. I'm happy to take your question Okay, a couple of, I hope, clerks into international humanitarian law or adopted in a way that it can be used in situations for armed conflict to indicate these protections sorry I went over time thank you very much and happy to take your questions okay a couple of I hope clarifying questions yes yes Rohan.

Yeah, I, you just sort of misused the emblems the you know in a way where you mean this specific emblem, not all emblems. I'm sorry that you feel that I misused it. So there's something called the distinctive emblem of the Geneva Conventions. When I as ICRC to talk about the distinctive emblem, I'm talking about, when I talk about the digital emblem, I'm talking about the digital distinctive emblem. So if that was unclear, to you, I'm glad that that's clear, but the project is called the digital emblem project. You used it without the full official. So I'm clear clarifying that for you now but I'll continue to do that because that's the name of the project Kind of an odd question Go ahead, Watson. Oh, watson ladd, Akamai So just to really simplify the point, and maybe to the point of absurdity, you're asking for something that, say, an MRI machine can put out on all its connections saying, I'm an MRI machine. Don't hack me I'm really sorry, I didn't hear the question Okay. I'm asking basically, you want an emblem, some way for a computer that shouldn't be interfered with Because it's, say, running an MRI machine, or it's a hospital's system where patient records are stored to indicate that it's a protect, that it serves a humanitarian system running an MRI machine or it's a hospital system where patient records are stored to indicate that it's a protect that it serves a humanitarian purpose and should not be interfered with by cyber operations Yeah, I think I understand the question. So basically, when I talked about that obligation to respect and protect what we really mean is that the medical services, themselves, like the work of the medical services, the work of search humanitarian organizations need to be respected and protected So just giving you an example, if you have malicious soft that I don't know disables medical equipment like a MRI machine, indeed, this could potentially be a violation of international humanitarian law because a party took, if it's done by a party, to conflict, because they're not respecting and protecting the medical system an MRI machine. Indeed, this could potentially be a violation of international humanitarian law because a party to, if it's done by a party to conflict, because they're not respecting and protecting the medical services.

Yeah Samit, thank you and welcome to the IETF Thank you. Great for you. Great to have you here My question is, one of scope for you we've talked, you know, about protection of cyber assets. Do you also see room here to protect physical assets with a digital emblem? So, and I think it's important to be really clear on this, and I'm happy to go into more detail during the discussion. So, but thank you for your question um this project is for digital infrastructure. It's for digital assets. The ICR has engaged in the process of looking at the you know part of our role is the development of an international humanitarian law. And where we see Lacuna, we indeed work on projects to fix those lacuna. We have not identified any lacuna with the physical emblem. In fact, we see dangers in moving towards a project that creates an inherent emblem or something like that. The emblem works. It has worked for 160 years and nothing in our analysis today is leading us to say we need to change this analysis. So this project and the work that ICRC is doing is strictly limited to digital infrastructure. Thank you for your question question jim reid speaking for myself. I think this is a great idea and we should do what we possibly can to help out. I think this is a great initiative. My question, though, is about issues of these emblems. It's fairly clear when you're talking about the stuff to do with the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, that there's an agency responsible for, essentially, registering those particular emblems and we can make use of them But for any of the other emblems that you were talking about earlier on, what would be the authority for that particular emblem would be the registry for it so that we would then know how to interact with them to say this is really, this really is the genuine emblem, let's say for an American exit sign or whatever where would be go to get that"

There's also another emblem for what we call dangerous forces, which are all under IHL. As I mentioned, the ICRC is what we what we call the guardians of international humanitarian law our role, and it has been for the last 160 years is to really see where there are lacuna in the law and promote an understanding, a dissemination of international humanitarian law and then a development of international humanitarian law So when it comes to the IHL emblems, the ICRC would then of course bring things to states. That's what we're going to be doing later this year at the international conference was the international conference next place once every four years that brings together all the states that are party to the Geneva Convention where the ICRC will present, issues that we see with the law. And one of the issues that we're presenting is indeed on the on this project on the digital emblem project but for now we're the project is limited to the red cross crescent and crystal that doesn't necessarily mean that it can't be enlarged the other emblems of IHL but for all the other emblems, the ICRC is not involved.

Yeah, hi, thank you So we've been working on digital emblems as um just explained by sammeet for a couple of years now together with the ICRC. And I'd like to talk about the technical aspect of them.

What we want to do is, what we seek is a digital equation to the Red Cross in the sense. We want a digital emblem applied to digital assets, for example, a hospital database. Next slide, please The purpose of such a digital emblem is to stop attacks, and to do so, we must show to what we call verifiers Verifiers are all those parties who want to, for whatever reason, attack digital assets. Could be a ransomware gang could be a state cyber command As Amit just said, in this sense, the digital emblem works like a stop sign and verifiers need to respect it in order for it to work. This means that verifiers must, sorry, that the digital emblem must need the needs of verifiers If they have no reason to look at it or if it might hurt the operations, they will not do so and it will not have an effect This has important implications on our problem statement. We'll talk about that soon, but let me also highlight the use cases that we are looking at concretely. In general, we would like to apply a digital emblem to any kind of network endpoint. The first use case that comes to mind here are server endpoints, so any kind of web server, a database server the obvious candidates. Secondly, we would also like to protect networks. We think that networks are a good solution to effect protect two types of other endpoints, namely what we call constraint devices and personal devices. Constraint devices could be any medical equipment that is network connected personal devices could be network connected"

So, we have identified a number of requirements for a digital emblem together with the ICRC, and I would like to highlight two that I think make the problem unique The first one of them is that a digital emblem must be removable This means that one should be able to remove an emblem at any time. We believe that in practice digital emblems can help to reduce attacks on digital assets, but there might be scenarios in which the protective sign becomes a target sign. We want the asset holders to be able to decide whether an emble is more benefit or a risk for them, and whenever they decide that it's more risk for them, they should be able to take it down We think that it would be easiest to provide this requirement by having the asset holders distribute the emblems themselves Secondly, there is the requirement of what we call covert inspection. This means that no one should be able to tell whether emblems are inspected The idea here is to meet the needs of verifiers Remember, verifiers are those parties that would like to attack digital assets, and you can think of this requirement as saying, verify would not want to signal that they are attackers That might hurt the operations and if a digital emblem would require to signal this, they would likely not use it One way to provide this for this requirement would be to distribute emblems without an explicit query for them Taken together, our idea is that we put emblems where attackers look anyways. For example, we could embed emblems in responses to queries that have plotted plausibility to be for something other than it digital emblem. We think that this is particularly challenging in this problem space because we've first need to find such a place and second we don't want to break things. If you now put something in a response that actually has a different purpose"

That's the end of my presentation. I'm happy to take any clarifying questions. Any questions? Felix Clarifying questions, only place Seeing none, I think we'll take Brian presentation now. Thanks, Felix Thanks Good morning, everybody. My name is Brian Haberman I think some of you probably know me, but one of the things that really comes up in these conversations I think Belix hit on it, and you know, these kinds of discussions have been going on for several years now And I think one of the things that that we've recognized for the work that we've been doing is just how broad the problem actually is Next slide. So while we heard, you know, Submit and Felix talk about you know, protections under international humanitarian law, there are other instances where there are protections under other types of laws, what those protections are kind of orthogonal to this discussion, really being able to display an emblem as necessary in order to get that protection, you know, as was being said earlier But there are also organizations that have to display emblems because of they're required to. Again, you know, kind of orthogonal this discussion, but because they're required to display these emblems, what we have to look at is as you move more towards digital capabilities, how do you give them? the same capabilities in the digital space? And the gap that seems to be appearing over"

    "text": "and over again is that secure real-time signaling a how do you give them the same capabilities in the digital space? And the gap that seems to be appearing over and over again is that secure real-time signaling of protections, because if you can't do that, then the people who are assets that are being protected aren't being protected in real time and you have no way of really understanding what those protections are. Next slide So one of the things that becomes really important here, is understanding that even with physical and emblems, you run into problems because you can literally paint things wherever you want you can slap things on there and if people are able to see it, they may not necessarily be able to verify it. So how is it that we can actually trust these emblems actually indicate what's going on? The other problem that we run into here is visibility Typically the physical emblems are something that people can see but if you're looking at it from a different angle, you may not be able to recognize it. And it's actually really hard for systems to recognize these old physical symbols. So how can we actually do something that's going to produce? these systems? from new capabilities? One piece that I think is really important is the non-repudiation. Can you actually create a mechanism that allows people to say, no, you really did display that emblem and this is when we saw it so that people can't display it for nefarious purposes, take it down and claim that they never did it So as these things kind of move along, and you become more and more tied to a digital infrastructure we need to start thinking about not only the digital assets that you want to protect like your networks and your endpoints, but also how do you actually augment the capability? that exist that need to be in place for the physical emblems. Next slide, please like your networks and your endpoints, but also how do you actually augment the capabilities that exist or that need to be in place for the physical emblems? Next slide. So in our work, what we really do is kind of looked across the space of all of these types of use cases and said, are there pieces of common? that we need to start considering? if we were to do work in the space? You know, clearly"

You want to make sure that you're actually looking at an emblem that has been verified or can be verified Going back towards, you know, who actually gave approval, who displayed it, what The other part here is really being able to increase the visibility. Can you create, a capability that allows people to feel more protected? because they now have greater visibility? into why they're being protected or why that signal exists? and then also being able to wrap in the ability to say when did somebody display it, when did somebody not display it? And finally, you get to the point of you know, if someone has requested use of an ambulance then granted access, and then they've been found to abuse it, you want to be able to revoke it So can you actually leverage capabilities that say you can no longer use this going forward? And when I think about these kinds of use cases and these kinds of needs, I see a lot of existing work in the IETI We need to figure out what the actual requirements are and how do we actually leverage those building blocks to solve this problem rather than trying to create something brand new from from scratch I believe that's it. Questions? Okay, thank you See, how do I get my hand up here? Get to a floor mic, Brian. Just clarification question. Can we size this?

I think the scope really comes into how many people are actually observing these emblems and can they actually do it in a scalable way without affecting the behavior or the activities of the device that's being protected by the emblem? but thousands of organizations i can i can wrap my head around, but I'm trying to wrap my head around again How many of these things are out there are going to be out there? in the next 10 years?

All right, so let me get smaller job Sorry. And you're advancing Okay, yep Howdy? I've been working with the team that's been doing use case interviews with the many different organizations that administer bodies of international law and the way this is been scope thus far is as markings that are required under international law. So, excellent Okay, so the idea is that the supplement or perhaps eventually replace physical markings that are required under international law.

Every piece of wooden pallet grayage, carton, whatever that crosses an international border is required to be marked to show how it is not moving termites and other you know, bugs across borders Next one is the blue and white shield of UNESCO for world Heritage Site.

So we're not talking about the digital emblem being physically affixed to the asset A representation of it could be affixed, but the digital emblem is a bunch of data And so think about this like a URL. You can see a URL printed on a billboard Somebody can copy that URL and put it on a bumper sticker or a t-shirt They haven't destroyed or invalidated the website it refers to. Those are all just pointers that tell you how to get to the website, copying the URL is not an attack against the website It's just another instance of the pointer Next slide So who are validators? Who would validate this data? Next slide We have the three really common cases and the one really uncommon case. The uncommon case in the top left is a loitering munition. Loitering munition might be trying to figure out what its target is What is a valid target, not a valid target. But the real common use case, hundreds of times a second, right? the world, are customs agents customs agents trying to figure out whether something should pass or be inspected or be destroyed or whatever Next slide So there's that ISO container one again right the customs agent is looking at a container but the interesting part of the container is the"

This is the real problem that we're solving with digital emblems, the prolific of incompatible proprietary scanners. These are stacking up in customs agencies because people who have physical markings that are required under internet law, that they have to put on stuff they are, they understand that digitalization is needed. They understand digitalization is needed international law that they have to put on stuff. They are, they understand that digitalization is needed. They understand digitalization is coming. They are doing the work to digitalize and the tidal wave of proprietary scanners is starting to fill the closets of customs agencies. Everybody who's solving this problem, is solving it in a siloed way, and they're all shipping their own new scanner to every customs agency. This doesn't scale And this, we're just at the tip of the iceberg right here, right? Just a few organizations have started doing this. But there are thousands of organizations that need to do marketing under international law, and each of those may have thousands, tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of things out there in flight in the world at any given time So what we really want is to have a single standard so that a customs agent can have a single scanner that can scan a standardized data format and present the information that right now they can see physically marked on something. That's really all this is about. Take the physical marking, have a standardized way that it can be read into a scanner and displayed on the back of the scanner Next slide So here's the structure. We have the issue and the asset, which are both bound to the digital emblem by a bunch of records. And then we have a bunch of ways"

We don't need to invent anything there What of interest here is that we get the binding defined such that it's sufficiently inclusive that we don't have multiple parties coming back and saying, oh, we need to start over from scratch because our use case is unique People's use cases are not unique, right? People need to take a marking and show it on the back of a scan and the ICRC know, the ICRC and, you know, sites and Ramsar, all these different boxes that are responsible for marking things they just need to be able to replace a physical mark and ideally convey more information than just that physical mark does and give non-repudiation the ability to expire the mark all these things.

The protocol is to facilitate communication we don't gate who gets to use it we don't say who gets to use HTTP to put up a website The person, the validator, the person who goes to look at the website, gets to figure out whether it actually represents the thing that they wanted to look at So this is a communications mechanism between issuers and validators. Validators already hand hundreds of years of experience in figuring out whether the issuer is somebody they care about or not We have expertise that we can bring to bear in homographs and stuff. So having the digital cross-signatures web of trust is really useful there, right? UNESCO might be cross-signed by the UN whereas UNESCO would not be right? Hello, watson ladd, Akamai It sounds from your presentation that you're assuming a situation where the organization entitled to put up this emblem all have a certain degree of capability to maintain the keys interact with an authorizing party I think in the protective emblem case, we really do want organization that are unable to do that to be able to use the emblem.

Okay, so two quick answers to that. Number one is that under the law, right now, what's required is a marking a digital equivalent to that marking is a convenience, which nobody actually requires yet. That would be a next step If people seem able to make this work, then, you know, the digital equivalent might not be such a big deal and I think that the digital version, is going to be way, way easier for a lot of people including all the cryptographic stuff, so forth, then the paper is Yep. All right. And I don't remember the other half I'll skip it. dennis jackson, Mozilla So, I understood your presentation is focused on quite heavily on physical objects. Shipping contains and so forth. I understood the ICRC's presentation is focusing exclusively on digital objects services, and so on. Is your position that these are the same problem? and can be addressed by the same technology? Or are these different problems in your view? These are absolutely the same problem. Digital is a small subset of the marking problem marking a website, a mail service digital data at rest, digital data in flight. The labels that can comprise the emblem are the same, regardless of whether it's that or a truck or a person or a building. But the bindings are quite different. The bindings are different for any of those yes but the information that you're trying to convey about them is what law are we talking about, where do you find it, who is the issue? Who signed it? Who are the cross signatures?"

I was stumbling in here under the impression that we are kind of helping the global society of doing the right thing and therefore helping critical infrastructure that is neutral all over the world to retain neutral and to present that also in the digital world. What I now saw is that we are doing product identification of physical objects which is, to my understanding, absolutely different out-of-scope problem statement that might end up with the same problem, sorry, with the same solution of course because you're kind of identical physical objects. This is an ages-old problem and there are QR codes, there are UPC codes, there's et cetera codes there's so many codes, EAN, whatever, and there are also there. That is, I don't think, the problem The problem is the unification. Again, I thought we were helping the Red Cross in a similar critical thing here to be safe. Is that a clarifying? question no no that is that is that is yes I will sit down, but this is very different. When we brought the to the IETF, the problem statement was yes and I have a clarifying question. So are you thinking that selective disclosure and device binding are in scope? or out of scope for the problem? In scope. In scope? In scope?

Right So if you use the word binding as a term of art and you say that binding has to include cryptographic proof exactly then no then no a term of art and you say that binding has to include cryptographic proof, then no, that's not how we're using the word binding.

And if they are, then maybe it wouldn't make sense to happen here. I don't know the answer to that. I think before proceeding to include that, you probably should know that answer If use cases for these things involve non-refudiation, it's going to get screwed up because we've tried to do that before and always failed.

Whereas a lot of times in the physical world, you actually do need very established like trace abilities by design. You want to know exactly what's linked to what And when those things get mixed up and tried to use in both sides, we tend to see a lot of problems And so I would just say, like, we should be very clear and I think life was getting at this. Let's pick off one or two very simple things and maybe try to define maybe some credential types or vocabularies or claims for Jose type know, or Jose type, you know, objects that might be helpful there I would also note that I think the IETF is already working on large chunks of this, right? I think Spice Skit have definite applicability, right? Skit's been looking just at the software supply chain side, I think officially to start, but obviously has applications in track a lot of these items. Spice for sure is looking very much at this. So if you want to look, actually in my slides I prepped earlier, looking specifically at EFITO is an example of why some of these public docs that are coming out of UN or ISO are actually working in terms of translating into the digital side and how can we improve that.

And I think that it's definitely, I would like to see this happening at the ATF than I saw or other like ITU that like ISO charges for standards and it's not very accessible. But for the digital information especially when it comes to red Cross, there have been efforts at a ICANN by Red Cross to reserve domain names and to protect their intellectual property which sometimes encroaches upon freedom of expression So what I fear is that they use this standard and other elements and come to ICANN and say, well,"

So I can say that I just want to to comment on the issue saying that the digital emblem I apply to just to other RCRC1 and the Geneva Convention I heard a lot of comments, but I want to really stress the importance of that there are many issues already when we talk about the digital emblem the physical emblem that has covered by the Geneva Conventions When used them, and they particularly, the culture heritage emblem So here I want to stress the importance of to cover different emblems and different use cases that were very well presented previously. I think that also we need to cover that in the standardization group very important comments to to to prevent any misuse. This is very important when you cover also arts objects to be identified and to be protected, particularly in confluent zones or whatever said.

And I think those are really some of the most challenging things that would be tackled by the IETF if it takes on this work And I think as a result, those need to be kind of the focus of a working group. I don't see any reason why we can't have two outputs from this one of which is working on a broad problem and one of which is working on a narrow one. I agree that there would be some value if they happen to be able to reuse some of the same building blocks, but I'm strongly of the opinion that they can't collapse into a single use case given some of the unique properties that have been brought out for the humanitarian and Red Cross use case. So I'm definitely in favor of the IETF continuing to discuss the work and hopefully take it up, but probably in two streams. Thank you Take that, Jay This is daniel king Gilmore from the ACLU Sorry that I'm not there in person person So I echo what Ted said about the scopes being pretty different and needing to be working in different places and I want to also just highlight that I think we need to think about how a system like this could potentially be misused as well even a thing that is voluntarily applicable like you could add it or remove it, you could imagine a party to a conflict saying, well, we're you know, especially if we're completely agnostic in how we design this about who the authorities are, you can imagine a party to a conflict saying, well, we'll set up an authority, we'll make these badges we'll put them on all of our guys, and we don't care whether you know about them or not and we'll block all other digital infrastructure that doesn't happen to have one of these pages just one example of a way that, um,"

First, I think we're going rather fast in terms of people essentially jumping to opinions on what I think was relatively short set of presentations and while we have a few we've had a few discussions online one of the things that occurs to me is that we really need to decompose the problems yet more in order to understand where those commonalities are. I think Ted's may be right that there's some stuff that's reusable. I sort of like the variable bindings using Bill's terminology that he put up there. Maybe those are separate efforts or similar efforts The discussion about customs, I'll just add obviously Cisco has an interest in that we ship products all over the world. I don't know the applicability of this work yet to that and we have some people who are expert at Cisco who can that we ship products all over the world. I don't know the applicability of this work yet to that. And we have some people who are expert at Cisco who we can bring in if that becomes the focus of the work. So my only concrete suggestions for next steps here this sort of thing that I would have expected would be either good to delve into and sort of an IAD program approach, right? or a workshop where we have more time and maybe even a little bit of preparatory time to really do that deep dive to figure out where those, you know, what are the building blocks we have that we can use, what to address which problems and where the commonalities are between within the problem space, where the commonalities are between the solution space"

In terms of the usual boff questions i think we do have a worthwhile problem here that is clearly scoped and within the capability the IETF. From a technical sense, I feel like there's basically two facets to each of the kind of use cases presented There's credential structure and formats and how you make the statements of the attributes you're trying to assert. And then there's a presentation protocol problem. I feel like, especially in the cyber protection of cyber assets question that question how you presents a credential in the context of whatever interaction a cyber operation is having with a cyber asset, that's very much you know those the protocols by which the operators in assets are interacting are largely IETF protocols and so it's very natural for the IETF to attack that problem I think Ted is probably right in terms of two work streams emerging from this. I think it would be good to get to the next level of detail and the requirements for the credential formats. And what they would look like in those two cases It may even be that there's two fairly distinct sets of stakeholders in those two vendors and customs officials on the one hand, NGOs and cyber operators on the other hand. So I think it's like that we end up with two work streams here, but I agree that this is a problem that the IETF can work on Watson watson ladd, Akamai. I'll be brief I think there is a real-world need for the protective emblem use case It's narrowly scoped. It has unique constraints that other use cases don't. That the protocol needs to accommodate. And I think the I IETF can and should work on it The need is now. We've already seen state-sponsored attacks go out of control and hate humanitarian assets"

We clearly recognize that identification and recognizing an emblem are two different problems. However, the minute you want that emblem to be strongly authentic and have non-repudiation, I don't know how to do it without specific identification We also face the problem of being able to see, you know, there's drone ID at a distance, even when the observer was off do it without specific identification. We also faced the problem being able to see, you know, there's drones ID at a distance, even when the observer was offline and thus unable to consult the internet for rich information about the identified entity, but we could still do trust classification at a distance, even when offline And I just want to read one line from RFC-9151 our drip requirements DRIP could be applied to verifiably, verifiably identify other types of registered things reported to be in specified physical locations. So I would just encourage that if we do proceed with this, that we look there at some of this sub-problems that we may have solved there. Thank you Paul Valkis, speaking as individual I've heard the term digital assets mentioned a number of times, and I think people have widely different opinions on what that actually means. I've heard someone say that a heart is containing patient files on a hospital server is a digital asset That's generally not how IETFers think of a digital asset They think more about public keys, IP addresses networks. So I think we should clarify that a bit better in any future charter. And the second point is that I hear a lot about sort of physical supply chain things And I think there are some working groups already around the IETF there's industry outside the IETF working on there. I don't hear much about the actual identifying networking part. And that's where I thought we were actually going with this.

Is that in scope or out of sky? So the chairs are not going to answer that question, but I hope some of the people are the mic line Chris Reshuk speaking for myself I did have questions about the scope. I think many of the others in the line have already mentioned it. I probably I personally be in favor of having a more of a natural scope in the beginning, as opposed to starting off very widely.

Thank you. richard wilhelm Public Interest Registry We're the registry operator for .org We're the home of many, many nonprofit and mission-driven organ organizations, one of which is the international Red Cross. Thank you, but there are also over 10 million other nonprofit mission-driven organizations about 10.9, if you're keeping count This sort of digital emblem would be very, very important for nonprofit organizations that use the internet for fundraising and also sorts of other important outreach activities as this audience is presumably aware these sorts of organizations are frequently subject to impersonation attacks on their websites through all sorts of things whether it be direct hijacking of their websites or impersonation email attacks where people send out emails that look like they're from the organization but they really aren't. These kinds of things happen whenever there's fundraising, things that are crisis driven all sorts of human humanitarian crises, natural disaster crises, or as we saw even digital problems with software distributions has happened over the past weekend. As it relates to the digital side of the problem and the physical side of the problem, I think that the digital use case and the physical use case might be closer than some people might initially think Sort of like QR codes brought URLs into the real world in a much different way than a lot of us in the room probably thought tend to fit years ago.

I'll be brief I think the general, jim reid, the general idea, I think you're working on the initial problem that was suggested with digital emblems for the, broadly speaking, the humanitarian use case, I think is something that the IETF could work on relatively quickly because it's fairly clearly identified and scope is somewhat constrained the bigger issues that Bill talked about I think are fascinating and I would like to see the IETF work on them, but I have a feeling we might be biting off more than we can chew because at that stage we're going to have to interact with a lot of international agencies World Trade Center, all sorts of other the World Trade Organization, international Labour Organization, Maritime Organizations, aviation, organizations, I think that problem could become intractable And then in that case, how they actually interact those institutions could be quite difficult, and I think it would be very hard for you example, for some of these people to come take their turn at the mic at an IETF meeting which might be another thing that we're actually make that work much more difficult to achieve a suitable end goal.

And it lets following standards add on to the as additional RFCs for different specific use cases. Thanks alissa cooper So I definitely am supportive of all the people who said to narrow this. It seems like a little boil the ocean listening to all of it And I think the other reason to do that is because it's kind of unclear whether there will on balance be a ton of benefit from this just because of kind of issues with ultimately being able to trust whatever it's being signaled. I think in particular, on that cyber attack, case, one thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is the contested nature of attribution of the source of cyber attacks. So, that's one thing that makes me feel like maybe this isn't going to be that useful because there's already a tremendous amount of debate of who was actually responsible for many, many cyber attacks, so whether you could hold them accountable because what they attacked was covered by an emblem, I think, is like a really big open question. And then finally, it seems like there's also a real risk of kind of creating perverse incentives here a little bit I mean, this notion that you signal this emblem, and then, so the MRI machines in a war zone don't get attacked, you know, all the medical devices in every other emergency room are fine to be attacked That doesn't really seem like a place where we want to end up with this, but it's seems like something that could be concluded"

The second, like, access to cut along is the use case in terms of international law or any other area or application I think the ICRCs use case where they steward something that is used widely all over the world is broad enough to be compelling. It has many different people that need to both issue and consume those tokens And it has a clear mandate and a clear set of existing requirements which means that it can be worked on productively I'm much less convinced that's the case for some of the other areas, and I think a useful distinction is whether we have stakeholders in the room that can speak to those kind of legal requirements and help us translate them into a technical standard.

That's going to be a little challenge in this case. There's a lot of different use cases but I think that we now have a better understanding of where people are, the sorts of the sorts of that they're contemplating. We have a bunch of people in the room who have familiarity with the tools that we're building and other working groups in the IETF and I expect that we should have a productive discussion about how we can structure the work Yes, there may at some point be discussion with the IESG, but I'm not sure that we're quite at the point where we can really give the IESG something to take at the stage Yeah, we are far away from this point, agreed So I think the next big steps happen on the mail list where we start proposing chunks of a truck, right? What work is appropriate for the IAT? and see if we can get consensus that we have enough people who are willing to pick up the pen do reviews, and do code I see a lot of nodding nodding Stick your hands up if you're willing to work on this topic, just to give us a sense I think that's pretty compelling That may be too many hands to actually be successful. Sorry if I can just do an AD override, like please let's remember we have a remote participants, so let's enfranchise them if we're going to do straw polling. Right, right I was just trying to get a bit of sense here, but thanks, Roman, for reminding that I will put that to a question in made-evice so let's enfranchise them if we're going to do straw polling. Right, right. I was just trying to get a bit of a sense here, but thanks, Roman, for reminding that.

That's okay if that's exactly if it starts getting bipolar we but the, we need to have some draft to discuss in the next IETA Hi, rohan mahy So on the, both in the May discussions and on the chat I heard and saw a lot of conflation between humanitarian use cases, the ICRC Geneva Convention defined distinctive emblem that has a very specific meaning. Don't use it unless that's what you mean And between the uses by humanitarians for press people for protection versus for other uses And so please, when you have these discussions on the mailing list or in the chat please be specific about which ones of these you mean. Thank you. Yeah so part of our responsibility here is to establish some of that common language. And thanks for clarifying that wrong. I would appreciate it if you send a mail to the mailing list with something of a taxonomy of terms as you understand them and we can get that down. Is the mailing list up? already? The mailing list is DM at IETF Okay. I was just going to quickly suggest that the proponents take the opportunity to figure out if there is a way to do a side meeting in one of the side meetings slots this week to try to get some of some detailed feedback from the identity community is like a massive nine-dimensional kind of"

I think this question is kind of meaningless given the, uh, the lay given the, like, breadth of the different use cases that were discussed today and the number of people who came up here and said, like, yours is interesting, but that one is in and or like are these subsets of each other or not so like the people who want to defend their counterfeit Cisco goods like if the ultimate charter that you use to create that working group like does that have anything to do with the people who want to protect the press? Maybe it does but it was kind of unclear so I'm not sure what you're learning from this question Yeah, I'm, I don't know what I'm getting at here either And that's, and that, is really the result of the ball, right? there There are lots of interest, but less specificity right? And we're trying, and we're going to have to narrow that down on the mail list, because we're not going to do it in the remaining two minutes and just about the mailing list, there were many people that are here for just one day to attend this both I hope they will keep engaged into the minute list and the discussion further. Please don't be able to come on the mailing list, there were many people that are here for just one day to attend this both. I hope they will keep engaged into the mailing list and the discussion further. Please don't be a one shot And shot is basically wrong word to use by the way way Quick clarifying question. I know it's brought up like one maybe two charters is a possible out the way. Quick clarifying question. I know it's brought up like one, maybe two charters. Is a possible outcome that we just identify? Maybe there's a couple of drafts that might fit within an existing working group because there are working groups that are covering a like chartered specifically around this area already just more broadly please point them out yes okay that's on an interesting morning and I'm sure there will be a lot of hallway conversation"
