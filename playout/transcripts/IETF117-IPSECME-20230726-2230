Alright. So This is the Nocco. please note that well. And these are the, you know, We have a couple of note workers, Paul and Anthony already promised to do something, but but we are taking notes in the notes, idf.org so everybody can actually go in there and, you know, and add their own stuff there, they need it. There's no need to take take, you know, everything else everything that is saved there. Just you know, what that what is this idea and then what is, you know, resolution, some and if there's some useful comments or or interesting comments or or questions, you can put those down. present during the presentations, there is no need to type in what the personally, sir. If somebody will be interested, they can go and check check the recording. Alright. So these are agenda? quite full, And we have couple of those very short of 5 minutes slots, and I don't know if how well the ARC will be. We usually haven't been able to keep up with those show shot, but let's see. Any comments on the agenda anybody wanted to add or modify or or remove something. Okay. Let's go forward. Paul? Just just a quick note. Okay. with the -- Germaine? Sorry. Palvato. Palvato's individual. I just wanted to make sure that any other business doesn't get kicked off the list because I would like to have a little item talk in any other business. So please make sure that it's not like, oh, no no more time for any other business. Alright. And as I said, please remember to say your name before you are speaking on the back own."

So there are multiple key extensors in the activation tool, and then we have the deprecation of the I version 1 stuff and obsolete algorithms. So those were published since last time. We have 2 documents that are in our of c editor queue. labeled IPSec and add Ike. And then we have actually, we don't have any documents that are in the ISGR in the 880, but that will probably be fixed very soon because we have some or some documents that are waiting for the write write up. So I version g i version 2 has been there for very time. That mostly what requiring me to actually go and read the document and make sure that actually is, you know, ready to be published. That's all. And then there is this unown speech. I believe we did we hadn't we haven't currently in the last call, working group last call, but I don't think I have seen that much of discussion, and I think we left it open. But it will be really useful if people would actually read it and and centralize the list. I I will send a reminder that you know, if you if you think that this is ready say so in the mailing list. I mean, if if we are not hearing anything in mailing list, that doesn't mean actually okay. It means that there is no interest, and then it will not go forward. And I think I have seen, like, 1 or 2 comments, but mostly for routers. So so And then we have a working working process, because you have TS Palos optional, which I was told that it's supposed to be ready for a working group last call, and then I make like, one minute check and so I found out that, oh, security considerations to be written. And I I don't think it's actually that ready for the working request, but working group, but it's actually interesting about the, you know, secret considerations also, not only, you know, the ISG and so on.

So there's been a little bit question on the list. Thanks very much to Tobias as well. So There was some more clarification for ipicom, and and Tobias points that needs to be clarified a bit more to make sure that it works. But but as pointed out on the list, it can just work for those who want it. And and if for some reason, People forget this payload to do it wrong. We can just send an error. It shouldn't really happen that More interesting part is that, obviously, send to 96 states that to notify message may only be included if there's an SA payload and with the optimized Wiki no SA payload. So, technically, firmly speaking, we should update this ARFs update 7296, which I know it makes the chair really twitchy. So please, I would like some advice on there if the chair and other people think that this This is big enough to actually require an update clause or not. Next night. And there's been some talk about the initial childhood there because you don't know the PFS that the peers would normally wanna use on the child to say because the initial exchanges don't convey that information. Once you do the the optimized wiki, you don't really know if They want to do PFS, yes or no, and with what group to do. And So do you get out of that how that how do you get that information?

Say it to create the first child, But all of them involve doing lots of old style exchanges, which waste a lot of bite, and especially for the IoT devices that sort of our provisioned, and they know anyway what kind of PFS groups they are sending. That that's all not really necessary. They're they're provisioned in a way that they will the right eye proposal. And so they they didn't know what what to do. So it would be nice if the document doesn't mandate that they first have to do a classical Wiki anyway before they can do the optimized Wiki. So I was hoping that if anyone has video objections in which is sort of states that that they would tell me now or on the list soon. because I I would like to avoid mandating it. Next slide. there was there was a bit of what exactly what kind of error codes to send, but I don't think that matters too much in this discussion The other things are already set. So next slide. There's there's an era where what do you do if it's a failure and it's an optimized freaky, you kind of wanna wanna make clear that this is a really big failure. And, originally, I mistakenly stated that the critical bit could be set so it's critical pay that. And if you fail, then, you know, it's a it's a critical, like, it likes a fatal failure. But, of course, it's a notify payload, and it's mandatory to support on the course so you're not allowed to set a critical date on it. So that is wrong. So the critical bit should be removed. we could decide to change the notify and make it a its own payload, and then you can set the critical bit, and then you can actually fill that way, but I think, again, that's that's just too much unnecessary work. So my proposal is just to remove the critical bit. So, again, if anybody has opinions Please let us know here on the list. Next slide."

So instead of giving it so I have I actually think that because this is optimizations. for things. We should actually just limit things and say that, okay. If you are using, you know, multiple or so, you are using CPIs Compression things. So Don't do this. Do no more if you are doing so we say that this is for cases where you actually have like, an in a an an situation. Like like, in most of these IoT more devices, they access have exactly one key access payload. They you know, even in the I, you know, in it. So we can say, You can use it in that case. If you have multiple TXAs, basically, it always assumes that the one that you use in Ike, is the same that we are you you want to use it later. And and and so so we can actually say that, okay, we do it that way. And if you if in some case, you actually want to use it in in in other situations. you have to do extra key to tell whatever you want to to be doing in the future. And after that, you can go back to growth of the milestone. Okay. So so I agree with all the points for that. except that the IP Comp where I you really wanna do IP Comp with the IoT device because it saves bytes. Right? The question is does because I I don't think those actually a dipecomp is I I have I don't know. But I I I think most of the then then then then Yes. People would assume that it's okay, but I think actually most of the implementations they don't actually do. I conference in the IoT because the pockets are so small, anyway, that they don't really compress that well. I mean, I'd be complex usually useful when you have because it's a it's a stateless complex compressor, meaning it can only compress whatever is in the same packet. it means that it's not really getting that much of compression if your buckets are ten 100 of pipe 100 pipes in total."

No. No. No. But I I mean -- So you have to include -- No. No. No. No. No. We optimize it out.

I hope you were there and try to focus on the specifics that are detail details that are relevant in this working group, I wanna talk about Specifically the protocol, that that we are proposing here. So just as a reminder, we're talking about doing IP second. The the interesting thing really about about this proposal is that it's it's IQV2ipsec But the the brokering of the connection and the authentication, tie back to the RPKI and the endpoints of the the the IPSec endpoints are autonomous systems. They are ASs and all the traffic that flows through them. And and so because their AS is they have RPKI identities, We have some notions about and something called ACS, the the AS control server and and the border routers, The important thing there is is that there may be a lot of AS border routers. And so potentially even for a single IP SEC association or tunnel between a pair of ASs, there could be a multitude of paths between a a bunch of 100 even of of border routers on each side. And and so and and talking about very large volumes of traffic. And so I think about what this proposal is about from a protocol perspective, it's about hyperscaleipsec. What if we wanted to doipsec at at enormous scale? to we thought a lot about how to make that possible. And in the original draft, we had a a fairly novel set of protocol elements. The latest revision has a lot less of that. And what we've done is as the authors have learned more about IPSec. We've"

We've try to defer as much as possible to existing or or proposed enhancements to IPSec and focused on basically just providing guidance on how you would do this using those existing or planned protocol elements. There is some novel protocol proposals in this draft currently And those are mostly related to what we are calling, maybe not quite right, transport mode. using the authentication header. I know that IP sect folks are not fond of the authentication header. As I've said, I don't I don't have the history personally. I don't really know why. seems like in this case, it's potentially a very good fit, and it saves us about 50 bytes on overhead on every packet, which, again, if you're talking operating at very, very large scales, you know, saving a few percent of backbone traffic. seems like a a worthwhile endeavor And so most of the protocol text in the document is focused on this transport mode, and things like, well, if You know, if we're doing this this tricky thing of adding and removing, I IPV 6 headers, for example, you know, what does that do to path MTU discovery? How do we make sure that that that that ICMP packet 2 big responses come back across this translation in a way that that that preserves their correct behavior. And so there's a lot of text about that. But, ultimately, actually, you could delete all of that from the draft, and it would still work because ESP is also supported it's just a little less efficient.

It seems like it was lost more or less accident because nobody cared about it. So but it seems like it could it could reasonably be forward ported. That would help a little bit. Mainly what I would like from the group is is 2 things. I'd really appreciate it if if some folks would look at the this draft and just see if we're holding it 1, you know, the authors of this draft are not really coming from an IP set background. And so I I just love to know there are places where we haven't quite gotten it right, we're we're the the current draft says things like that you can use active source redirection in IP2. This idea that you can say, you should expect the packets to come from somewhere else to potentially create separate essays representing each of your border routers so that they don't have to share state. I know somebody who understands this a little better It would be very helpful if you could check us on that. And the other thing I wanted to mention is that the area directors have kindly offered us a mailing list to talk about this since it doesn't neatly fit into the existing working groups. anybody would like to be part of that discussion, If and and think about this very interesting hyperscaleipsec, problem space with us, I'd really appreciate that.

So I would really ask you to look particularly at the inter domain problem and gap analysis, and make sure we have got all the problems. And if we if you guys have spotted a problem, we don't have please tell us. We will then undertake to start an architectural analysis and a solution approach analysis. And we have not made a decision on what that should look like. there are proponents who like in every IETF working group I've ever been in, believe that their solution is the right answer There are at least 2 of those. They are different. I have no problem as chair if there is a third. So Assuming you're not trying to rush through for some reason, I would really love to see you participating in both the current Kaplan and need analysis.

But given some feedbacks we received, today. there is a discussion whether that's the right approach or if we should take a notify. We are pretty open to that, but I'd like to take that session to make sure that Everyone understands that we have a problem to solve. So currently, in the security association, the traffic selectors in the security association are basically defined from access control parameters, which is the IP address to ports, appelli your protocols and so on, but not the DSCP value, and 1111 I think we we need to to also consider is that the DSCP value is actually a value that tells how the traffic is being steered as opposed to where that traffic comes from or goes to. So I mean, DSCP is not something new in IPSec, and the way current the IP stake architecture, RFC is handling this DSCP value is is like, it's saying you you need to have a classifier.

So we can a little bit ahead. I'll schedule like this back presenters was exactly 5 minutes as promised, so we can have a discussion on with that. I think there have been have a discussion already in the mailing list. So any comments questions here in the mid in their prope I think the main comment we had in the list was that there was people were really a bit confused why you want to be you know, using DCSPS and as a know, real as as a selector, because because, I mean, most of the people have been saying that, okay, traffic you know you know, quality of service types are not really selectors. They are something that can be changed over time and changed over, and they are per attributes of the domain domain anyway, so I had to do a mapping and that kind of thing.

They're not even necessarily from the same vendor, but they're they're 2 devices, claiming, a tunnel of some kind, a GTP tunnel or more particularly an ACIP re tunnel common case, whole bunch of traffic going over them, And there's a subset of the traffic that is critically important, so it's marked with a different DSCP. And when it gets to the queues because of the way queuing works, The disordering exceeds The IP reordering protection window. and the traffic which made it through the network just fine gets dropped by IPSec because it looks like it's bad. And if we can separate this out and make sure the two ends are in are in agreement about what's going on, it seems a natural thing to negotiate. that that we're doing this over these these these set of child assays, if we separate these out, We avoid this problem. yeah, you can configure lots of things that are more complicated to configure to do it in a harder way, but that's the fundamental problem we're wrestling with. Yeah. So And the answer has been always to that that RFT architectural ipsec architecture already says that if you have a pick that has multiple, you know, different quality of service types that wide course, these kind of things happening. You put them in different essays, that's why you must be able to configure that kind of setups. That's already there there. So it's more or less an implementation drop you know, I would say, inventories and bugs that they actually put them the same essay, The other solution that, of course, is to make the replay. know, window much, much, much bigger.

So but, also, the the other I mean, the the other issue is that with what The IP IP Tech Architecture document says, is that I mean, you can't have this kind of selector that split the different d c DSCP values between different essays but it doesn't mean that you end up with the both peer using exactly this MSA's also.

And this is the situation we want to to avoid, So those fragments happens in two ways the first way is the fur I mean, the first scenario is when you have I don't remember how it's called. when you have, yeah, the mid tunnel fragmentation, which means you're you're sending an IPV you you are encapsulating into an IP V Four packet with the done fragment bit set to 0. and you have a Bravo on the on in the middle that is fragmenting that packets, So the eager security gateway is perceiving those fragments. And one thing we need to understand is that the Ingris, security gateway, has he's he's not aware that fragmentation that occurs. So what we would like that the egress gateway can you can actually inform the ingress gateway that fragmentation is happening. And the expectation is that that egress gateway handled it's packet handling so that that fragmentations it does not happen anymore.

So What do we do then? So Yeah. So the the the the basic thing is to to to understand is that If you have fragmentation, at some point, it means the packet was too big. And so the the idea is that the the ingress security gateway adapt itself. So inform the I mean, the the the sender that its packets is being too too too large. and to to reduce the size of the packet. So in order to to do that, to inform and to interact with the centers, we do rely on the existing mechanisms provided by by the IPSec Architecture. So this is not something we are changing. So on this figure, what we can say is that given the size of the packet to be encrypted. mean, when it's sufficiently small, there is no fragmentation, then when it's it's a little bit larger, we can end up into fragmentation that fragmentation can happen at different either within the network or directly by the the ingress security gateway. And when fragments are way too big, then we we can end up in a packet too big to be processed by the egress security gateway. So we are we're basically creating 2 messages 1 which is selling simply"

So One thing we need to be very clear is that when I'm sending link maximum atomic packet notifications, meaning fragmentation occurs. In many cases, it doesn't mean the packet has been discard. It just means I'm working you were giving more work than you could do. But this is part of the normal way to handle the traffic. So so so what we're doing is basically an optimization. When the packet is too big, it means simply the hardware is not able to to end up with that size. So here is an example of of an illustration. So we are taking the the example where you have a mid tunnel fragmentation. So the egress gateway received 2 fragments. When you received the first five minutes, it provides the IP version as well the fragment length. in a notify payload. and and when the ingress gateway received that, fragments. It it asked the source or the sender to adapt its size of the payload. using the regular ICMP packet too big, but that's well designed mechanisms from the IP IPSA architecture documents.

On the other hand, so for them, having some fragmentation is not an issue.

We propose to use multiple sequence numbers in space subspaces instead of multiple child assays for multiple performance, US, and what different traffic. In the last draft, we added an IT transform to negotiate maximum faces, We also increased the sequence number field and ESP packet to 64 bits. and add it to subspace ID in the most significant sixteen bits of that field. I will not be getting into too many details about why creating multiple channel essays is not ideal as we are presented about that in the previous meetings. And there is also this is also discussed in more detail in a condition called ESP problem statement by Stephanie Placement happening later today later in this meeting. Right. We are currently implementing the current version for rough on the vector packet processing open source data being famer. which we intend to publish in the coming months. we are also working on a growth source implementation which is intended for deployment in Cisco Meraki's close to 2,000,000 devices worldwide. Finally, these are the updates in the current draft. We have made it mandatory for the surface ID to be between 0 and 1 minus the number of such pieces. negotiated by key, this is to improve the security and performance when using such spaces. Also, extended sequence number must not be negotiated by when using substrates because substrates negotiation implies that the packet contains a 16 minute subspace ID. and a 48 bit sequence number count counter."

Also, unlike ASN, the integrated check value calculation is done from the beginning of the ESPI field. to the end of the intricate ESP payload. since the entire 64 bits of sequence number is explicitly included in the ESP header.

I mean, even today, we've seen already 2 So I think most of the people here in the room can feel the pain we're getting from there. And that's actually what we are discussing in the draft I'm talking about. So another thing is the header and trailer format, but which might not fit anymore into all use cases but that still looks to do in a draft. We plan to cover this in the next version.

So we identified 5 possible solutions. The first three of them do not need any changes standards while the last pre need a bit of a change of the standards, but we will see that later. Okay. Next slide. So first, let's have a look. And what happens if we disable replay protection. I mean, apparently, it just solves all the problems about reordering and synchronate synchronization in a trivial way because don't have reproduction anymore. And, of course, it doesn't need any change to standards. But, of course, that lowest the level of security, and it has a downside that we've still can parallelize anything over multiple CPU cores. because we have all the same FBI here on the packets, packets Ben Schwartz. Why sorry. Why can't you paralyze the the receive? because we have no key to parallelize it. It's all fitting the same as sales so that the order header looks the same. on each packet. Yes. But you can spray them across cores at random because -- No. That she should better not do. Why not? Why not? I mean I mean, you're getting reorder in Well, that's but you just said there's reordering already, and you're trying to tolerate reordering. So reordering the packets -- Yeah. Yep. about reordering in the inner packets. That's what you're getting. If you spread it randomly over the CPUs, you're getting your inner pack is reordered, and TCP doesn't really like that. Okay."

I don't think there there might be one bug get going in front of us. But, I mean, if you are Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's it's the it's it's very small amount reordering happening. If some people decides to watch a movie than your I think. Yeah. I mean, just to justify what he's saying. Right? there's a five tuple that's used a lot. right, to put a flow on a specific core. Right? The problem is you can't use that. And for the same reasons you want that to happen For regular TCV traffic, Yeah. Stephan wants it to happen for IP set. and Schwartz. So First of all, what I'm trying to say is that the the point of this is to tolerate reordering, which means that the packets are already arriving out of order. Maybe you you could argue reasonably that that that strategy would make the reordering worse. But you can't argue that that that you are that you don't have to tolerate reordering with like, you have to tolerate it either way. just maybe more of it or less of it. Yes. I I think you're getting problems with that if you try it, Okay. -- for the children. The the other thing I wanna say is You do have more interview that you can use here. If you disable replay protection, then there's no real need to use the the packet number for the packet numbers to be in any particular order. which means that you could use them to categorize your different flows and then have stable -- But you still don't your know what's inside.

But multicore case is not solved because it just solves the problem on the transmits side, as I said, or what we discussed. We have just one SBI, and we can't can't can't distinguish. And, also, it lowers the level security, so we would not recommend doing that for the general case. So next, So next thing you could do just to increase the anti replay window size. Also, there are no changes to standards needed, but you still need synchronization done between calls or molecular centers or ever. Also, resistance has the same problem, so we can't paralyze as we want that's Another thing is that the anti replay window can grow as much as you want because you have to hold quite a lot of state if you provide rather big. Nothing is the configuration. I mean, it might complex because, I mean, which size fits for your use case. It might vary over time, and it might get rather hard to find the real size the a good size for the anti replay window. So next one. So, basically, this solves the multipath and the knowledge of service case and case get to figure out how big your anti replay window should be but it does not solve multicore and multicast because we still need synchronization. So we would also not propose that for a general solution. That's that's Next thing you can do is just using multiple ICAs Well, also there, you don't need change any standards.

We still have independent sequence numbers and and the replay windows, so we don't need synchronization on the TX side and same on the Rx side because we have different SBIs, so we can do it as there. advantage is inherited from the previous case. Of course, it This still has overhead, but it has much less overhead than the mobile I guess and it inherits across the failure model. this. sold That would also solve all the cases. The multicore case is implemented in draft. I have fear And I think the quality of service case is that was Daniel's trying to do. Again, this does not solve combination for the same reason. And it still does not really solve the generic case, cancel low hanging fruit. So we about"

The last thing you could do is using multiple sub child assays, so the idea was already presented. here in the meeting. So let's just use multiple sequence calendars per SA. and then encode a sequence number counter ID on some header field. Here, there are multiple possibilities to which battlefield to choose. And to me, at least, it's not yet clear which is the best one. Next slide. So I think you actually got 3 So you could just use some bits of the sequence number that was done in the subspaces draft in the first version. But, unfortunately, that reduces the available sequence numbers per child essay and probably only suitable for the ESPN case. Also, it it has a bit limited RSS support it crawls next down to RSS on the sequence summary because just just just doesn't make sense currently. What else you could do is just use some bits of SPI. Here, you would get you you would get RSS because you're already do that. SBI is a known field, and that would just work out of the box. all the last thing to do is use our next new header field that's basically what's done. And version tool, Graft after the subs business draft, they transmit to full 60 for that sequence number and take out a couple of bits there to encode it. That's, of course, the biggest change to all that standards, And, again, it has limited RSS support because we have a new feel the needs don't know about that currently. Let's select Well, advantages is the same of 4. It depends sequence numbers and and your replay windows. We have distinct SPIs to do RSS. And but now we have"

    "text": "not really wreaking overhead in a clean failure model because we have only one SA between the two gateways. So that's what we are getting more with just approach. disadvantage here is, of course, it's the most change we can do, and we have to care about security implications. because, for example, IE must not repeat in counter modes. And we have to care for packet bytes or rekey limits because they must applied to all sub SA combined. So you have to do a little bit calculation to get it right here. Next slide. Okay. Yeah. Well, This solves all the cases and even coming on combinations of cases. But as said, most change, and we have the left care to get security right, So the thing what we need to do here, we have to choose the header field. So we identified 3 SBI sequence number or new field. We have to pick 1. But this might solve the general case. and it's worth to continue this approach. Next, I think I will skip just for time reasons. Next. So my question is is the working group interested in continuing buttons, and should we make it a working group item? slow either. happy to your comments on that. all questions. Ben Schwartz. I like the sub child. Essays approach. I think but I I can't speak for the group at all really, but I I think it's worth I think it's worth pursuing. and in terms of security, you might wanna think about using a key derivation function, to generate distinct, symmetric keys for each of the sub child essays. that's that's very computationally cheap, and the key separation would avoid this kind of aggregate limits most likely. You'd It's it's a little bit like a regular child, I say. Yes. But it avoids"

No. No. Because the API question person to allows you to do the challenges without different elements, and you can actually you know, multiplex than because there is a window size, they can do tens of them at the same time without the projects. Of course, So the implementation still support these features, but They don't support this feature either. Yes. Alright. Yeah. So You have Can you do it? with no hats on them, I like this solution. I also like the parallel child to say solution because I implemented this once. Yeah. I think the working group should take on this work. Restrict is neutral. Yeah. this is one of the things that I actually really need to talk with the AD to ask ask if if if you actually because this will be modifying ESP, and this is making ASP version 4 is not necessarily minor extension to ISB. Okay. Paul, you had something on the any other asked, is there is there any other comments on this thing? And I I will skip the adoption call, and Paul will have have to come up with the open discussion. if it's okay for you that Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So very short. I'm sorry. Yeah. Is it a question for No. No. No. No. No. No. But this So so so very short. This working group has a problem that doing work every 4 months for 2 weeks in a row. This is a problem of everybody involved here, including us, authors, audience, and chairs. I propose a a a attempt to fix this, at least briefly, by doing an interim in, like, 2 months from now so that we at least get a somewhat faster cadence until we figured out how we can actually work without only doing work at fiscal meetings. Okay. And I'll channel Daniel from the chat room with the This is interesting. Hydro have limited disease. limited number of assays."
