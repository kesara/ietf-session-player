Like Martin said, I've been doing this for one year, but Ip has been going on quite some years. So I was starting to look at when we published our first arts, and it was nineteen ninety eight. It was a Rf c about framework for for defining metrics. It's quite an interesting document itself. That's nineteen ninety eight. And what this see guys we have published sixty two Rf c's the most recent one was in December twenty twenty two. Let's R ninety three forty two about alternate marking. Currently in the working group we have fifteen active documents. And as you see over the years, it's been kind of a kind of a even... I mean, it's been quite productive all over the years. Quite looks like it picked up a little bit more more recently, but it's it's it's been turning along for quite some time it's working group. So like please. So, yeah, Ip performance measurement. What is it then? So we'll go some background on what this group does and what it is? So next slide. So there like three core things we're focusing on in Ip. It's metrics. So that's like like, what kind of stuff do we want to measure? What what what do we wanna understand about our networks. And then we're looking at methods, like, how do we actually"

    "text": "What do we do to obtain these metrics pretty much? And then finally, we also have them the protocols, like, what what are they? Are the actual interactions we need to do, What are the bits on the wire and all of that. These are the three core things that we're doing. Next slide please. So let me start looking at what we mean with metrics. So here's a quote from from from an Rc that tries to define what we meet with metrics. So we try to standardize metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of infinite internet data, delivered services and applications running over transport layer protocol for instance, Tcp for you to repeat. So that's really the scope of things. And there's a lot of things you can measure. And we're trying to sort of define what these metrics mean and give them well defined names so that we can use them in reason about them. So things like one way delay round trip delay, packet delay variation, people like to call it Jitter, we call it packet of delay variation. Connectivity, one way packet loss etcetera etcetera. A lot of things. We try to have clear cut definitions of these things so that we can reason about them and and design protocols to actually measure them. So so these this is a really core fundamental the part of what we're doing Ip. Next slide please. So... But of course, you need some methods to obtain these metrics. So there are various types of methods that are being defined in Ip and we have like, three broad broad categories of methods for obtaining this these different performance metrics. So we have what we call active methods and that's when you really inject traffic into the network using some protocol and you you you measure what happens with that traffic that you you are injected injecting. And then we have passive passive measurements and that's when you observe packets that are not injected by"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:16:00",
    "text": "you as an observer, you're more just looking at stuff flying over the wire. And... Yeah. Deriving your metrics from that. And of course, we have hybrid methods that are that are combining these two ways. So you you might have some actor that's generating some adding some fields to to the traffic and you have some measurement points that that don't have to be directly related to or act actively injecting this traffic. But you might be tagging and marking packets something on the path. And we usually call these hybrid methods. And there are a bunch of methods that have been defined. So we have things like alternate marketing method, which is where you you you set a single bit in in Ip header and then flip this bit in various ways to be able to measure things like packet loss. We have things called in c two o and m where where where you tag on till telemetry data on the packets. We have Ip capacity methods, etcetera lots of mesh methods being defined in various ways we go look at a few of these and what's going on with them. So we can go to next slide. Another important thing that I has been doing, like just going through the history here so is that we've been working on the protocols then. And for for active measurements. There there's a political sweet been very important that has been defined by Ip and this this o t and stamp protocol protocols. So it's o this one way active measurement protocol. So you're using this to be to to to measure sort of one way properties of of of your network. It's an active protocol, so you're you're injecting traffic into the network. Between declines and servers. And then we have two way active active measurement protocol that does the same, but you're actually kind of reflecting the test data. So you you can you can measure sure you can measure kind of two way properties of of the"

And then there's a simplified architecture around this T we call it stamps, so simple two way active measurement protocols. These This is really the the cooler fundamentals of what Ip has been doing. But now we can move on to kind of the where we are right now. So current status. Next slide, please. So at the moment, we have eleven work group documents. So if you remember, I said we had fifteen active documents So eleven of these are currently working working group documents and four of these are documents have been submitted to the And they are in various stages of the of the process there. Next slide, please. So we have active work going on on new metrics new methods and new protocols. So kind of keeping into the charger there. But of course, there's also quite a lot of work on, like maintenance of these protocols that we have been defining and also extensions to them to, like, make them more up to date for various reasons Yeah. Slide. So what we can say right now, looking at what's going on in Ip right now. I would say that we have kind of two broad scope of of work that is going on, which is somewhat intersecting, but also somewhat kind of not. So we have a lot work going on about, like, being able to measure stuff as an operator, so like measuring things within your domain. So we usually call it limited domain where you're typically or an operator and you're in control of your infrastructure. So there's a lot of work in that space. But we also have a lot of work on on sort of and and protocols that are more designed for being able to kind of measure any network path between two hosts or endpoints. So... Yeah. Test protocols that you can spin up as a client somewhere and test towards any cherry server. And and then"

So it next like So some examples of of these these categories of work that we have right now is we have this alternate market marking method that was just recently published this and standard track Rf. Which is about tagging tagging packets with with single bits to be able to do sort of passive monitoring of of this of these packets. Typically, this is something you would do within some network domain. We have this thing called I io m, which will be talking a bit more about, which is also really about doing measurements within the specific domain tagging your packets adding data to them to telemetry data various forms. We're defining new metrics, which are typically very much targeted to to to operators and like, this... We have something called precision availability metrics which is about like, observing adherence to specific, like, service layer objectives and how how like, how much do want hear to these objectives and things like that. So that's very typically focused on kind of operator domains, limited domains and such. In in the other space, we we have various work. We have some extensions to this and T protocols. We have work on what we call Ip capacity measurements, so it's like some protocols on how you actively determine the Ip capacity of some network you can also use use that for deriving other metrics. And we have some interesting work on which is called responsiveness on the working conditions, which is really not just measuring your network, but really measuring from a user perspective. So it's it's it's including kind of entire web protocol stack. So Tcp h two Tls all of that is parts of of of the measurements and you you're deriving interesting metrics using a kind of"

So it's it short for in operation administration and maintenance. So this is really on this left hand side. We're looking at we're looking at obtaining telemetry data, specifically as an operator or an operator of some kind of limited domain. So This is a set of documents that's specifies then kind of performance monitoring and tracing. In what we call limited domains. And there is some formal definition of limited domains, but generally, it would be kind of a domain where some operator or some entities is in full control of of of of the of all the nodes in in that path. So what I does is that it records O and M information with impact kits when the packets traverse a specific network domain. So all of these transit nodes would would would look for io headers and then they would read that and then they would calculate some data and then either append that data into these packets and forward them along this path. Or it could just store the data and then export them using other metrics. Other the other methods as well. But it's really about having this in band O and M packets that you that you either trigger you to measure stuff to to export stuff or... Yeah, etcetera. And you would have a set of nodes in this type of in this type of architecture, so you would have what we call an Io cap node but then adds these I headers to packets, and then you have a bunch of transit nodes that that that reads these packets. Looks for okay. What what headers are here, Does that mean that I need to do something, maybe I need to to measure something and then maybe I need to add something to this packet before forwarding, etcetera, etcetera."

And like I said, this oem data can be added directly to two packets. Or exported separate O and M packets. So there are multiple options for handling the the tracing pretty much in the tele telemetry export And it's important because this is designed to be completely independent independent from underlying in en protocols. So you can implement O and M on on various layers, and you can even have multiple layers of io m stacked on top of each other, depending on how your prop protocols suite looks like. So... Yeah. Short overview of this. Next slide, please. So a little bit of the status of this Io work, it's been quite active work in the Ip working group. And currently, we have three published Rf around this. Specifying the data fields. So are the kind of data that we're interested in in this in this transit models and such. And then we have various ways of of of looking at the exporting of data. We have some active documents. A few these are in submitted Or in various stages of completion. We have an informational document call I deployment with talk, which talks a little bit about these various deployment scenarios you can have for for setting up and work. We have I am, which is is a method for kind of discovering different I capabilities within your domain. We have ibm ip six options. So this one realization of I. Some active working you document as well. We have some young model links and we have some data integrity work so that you you can kind of protect your your au options. Yep. Thanks slide, please."

The working group like I said, we had these two two two different broad scope, sort of the one scope is really focusing on on network telemetry as an operator, and this is sort of far on the other end, which is this work, which called the responsiveness on the working conditions. So this is measurement method and metric, targeting end users. With the main goal would be to kind of highlight how much respond how much your responsiveness proceed response in this as a user can be degraded to due to buffer loads. So is really to kind of load up the network path as much as possible using using standard protocols that a user would normally use for a big part of its normal interactions with the Internet. So would be using Tcp tls has to be two. You generate enough traffic to achieve what it's described as working conditions. And this is done by kind of gradually adding more and more load generating Tcp connections so that kind of not just one individual, not just one single Tcp connection because you will likely be receive window limited and you might not actually reached this point where you really kind of saturate a bottleneck buffer and such. So you keep adding load to the network until you you decide that you have reached what's called working conditions, And when you when you reach these working conditions, you start measuring something called responsiveness. And this responsiveness is a metric defined in this document. It's it's sort of defined in terms of round trips per minute and it's... You you measure this by sending kind of probe requests So you keep sending http get requests while you have... While you're in the state of having loaded the network. And then they're sending two types of"

And then all of this is combined, apply and statistics and you calculate responsiveness. And Yeah. It's it's and the idea with this one is really to present something that is meaningful to an end user. So if the I stuff that we're looking at that was really targeted to to to operators. This is more for end user. And they serve quite different purposes. But anyway, this is active working group minute right now, it's it's actively being worked on. It's it's progressing nicely through through the working group. I say. So... Yeah. Next slide, please. And then we have a kind of similar active... Active method in protocol as well. Looking at similar stuff, but from a slightly different angle. So this is called Ip capacity mesh So this is right from some some work that was done on defining an Ip capacity metric in a method and now this work being done on a protocol to to measure this. So this instead of like, in this responsiveness work, we had... We were using a really user centric protocol stack. So we have Tcp Http two Tls all of these things. Talking to http be servers. This one is more focused on just measuring purely the network component of of Yeah. Yeah. For your performance, so it's using Udp for this. So it's it's using udp to both for load generation and controlled measurement. Control messages. So load is generated in one direction between a client and a server and you have another endpoint that the other point sends One endpoint sends load and the other one sends frequent status message So here, here, again, similar to to the to the previous method is that you you load up your network until you realize that it's fully saturated. And then you can report things like what is the current Ip capacity, but this also enables"

But using two very different two very different ways of obtaining this. So this is also an interesting work that goes on. Next like And finally, we are of course, doing quite a lot of protocol maintenance and extensions to previously standardized protocols. So we have a lot of you know, small extensions to to to this Oh T stamp, etcetera. So we have we are making sure that it works over like, for instance, link groups and things like this so you can measure really like, different components of of your path extensions to make stamp work with segment routing young modeling And then there's some work going on. On the defining version two of Pd, which is some Ip six destination options for for measurement and this work is really going about protecting this options. So encrypting them pretty much. So making them more security use. This is some of the main work we're doing. And finally, we can go to next slide. So what's next? As you see we have quite a lot of active work in the working group, and there is quite a lot of work related to the working group that might end look in it. So currently, we have sixteen related Internet drafts and lots of potential work. There's a lot of interests in sort of both of these areas that I talked about both this kind of endpoint user centric type of measurements, but also this kind of operator domain telemetry work.

And this is a quite quite good information. So lars. Take off my mask without. Getting my glasses broken. Last I got another question because I remember when we decided to put the Io m based work. In Ip the thought process was that they would use the same metrics. Then that we're done for November two m. Way back when and maybe are still being maintained. Right? Yep. Is that happening? I believe so. I believe that I think we should have some To answer that completely, because a lot of this has going good. Good put part of these data fields and these metrics are being reused, but I think there there are other ones as well.

They have... They... They're quite if they have... They have github top repo and wiki and and community pages and such. But I think it's it's it's something for us to consider to...

And Maybe would make sense to document where we can find tools for both of these and Yeah. Definitely something for us to to consider. Not something we have right now. Okay. Cool.
