For Mini Tacker, I think Italo has volunteered to check the minis, but for animal errors, please if you like John Italo and have us to capture the discussion. And the session information today in this room, we will have a to our discussion for the IV session. And the materials are available at the link the bottom of the slide Next slide, So Here is our today's agenda. We have a couple of documents be submitted in IV. I think all of them will be presented today. I think, they include the not to young, dead model for network inventory, and, network inventory software extensions inventory topology model, and the network inventory entitlement and license and the young net model for power management. And also, the asset life cycle management and operations. Then we will have Alex to present the your amount to proposal and then followed by the why to present the digital map. I believe we will have a 20 minutes for the buffer time and also for the open discussion. Could and in comments, from from the agenda, you will notice that we successively failed, our first target, which was that we have a single document working group.

And, finally, I think I we we have reached some agreement and this is a proposal from our side And we consider that, there should be the base model inventory may base model. And it could be augmented to support the hardware extension and software extension and entitlement. And we also, consider there should there's some requirement to do the mapping between the inventory and topology. So, let me summarize that the our proposal with 3 points the first for postal funders, is that we consider the base model can mostly focus on the physical network animal and hardware component, n, this base model could be based on the CCAM inventory draft And we still need to, generate the list of never animal to support the also the, virtual never animal. And we also need to generalize the lease or component to support the software component to augment to their base model and define some in some other draft The second proposal for nurse is that, to define the hardware extension model which include their, power supply units, specific extension."

And I think this draft could define the attributes and identity needed for the software management and also the virtual never animal. This the 4th proposal from our side is to define a license management augmentation to the base model And we are also glad to see that there's a a inventory entitlement job to focus on this part of work The face proposal. Funders is we need to define a navigation from the inventory and topology and, This draft lift data model should be based on the network model in instead of bay, base inventory model. It could define in the set, single job And currently, we're also glad to see that this will have been powered by the IV never inventory topology draft. Okay. Next slide, this Okay. Let me introduce the proposal from the outside for the inventory based model. As what we suggest in previous slide the base model could be based on the, second network inventory drop and, for the second network inventory draft, it is mostly based on the, FC 8348.

And we were discussing yesterday with the authors on the network, then on the network inventory entitlement draft. I still, have a perception that the entitlement it might not be well consider under the core concepts for the inventory should take. I see entitlement and we cover that in our draft. I will be reinforcing the the concept and see if we get an agreement but entitlement can also be linked to functionality on router zones. On device, network devices, or even software. And this entitlement for me should be in a higher level. If we call it something else, we are good and we agree probably is a question of call the concept differently but I understand entitlement should be covering more than just the network inventory at the hardware server level. Thank you. Okay. K. So so you are you are suggesting to call it differently. So, like, inventory entitlement, as opposed to some you're layering entitlements in something like that. Is this your proposal? Yeah. Initially, when we were, part of the ops are working group,"

Not call and title. We could still refer to the same concept at the base level, but we need to consider that extra functionality to add features or functions to link into this entitlement concept. Right? And this is not reflected here. So I can see that the feature, you set is the feature and application of controller, not only the the the function of the the hardware and software in inside the never animal Yeah. Feature basically is a a function, right, a capability of the network device, right, network element. It could be as well a feature on compute on an application level, it could be anywhere defined. Right? So it's still the functionality of never animal. Yes. Nigel. So I wanted to measure that Cianna. Sorry. I wanted to, see if you were gonna consider the expectation intention expect of the, model we talked on that briefly, respect to what we had in Tapi.

We have databases, the the the the the the the routing database, Rib, etcetera, that is there, and it's I don't see how this could be part of an inventory. For sure.

That was my point also during the virtual meetings. So I fully agree with with Diego that the the topology. I mean, If you speak about assets, Right? There is a fiber. There is this.

This is a question for the working group. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So looking at this draft for the first time. Last night. That was the question that question with you. Well, I I didn't even know that this working was there, by the way. And so I'm I'm showing up because I think it's an important working group. The second thing is for the state of your device, if you look at 8345 you actually have mostly devices that are in the network whether physical or or virtual, But it's also interesting to have devices that are planned to be in the network. And, so putting them in the network, being able to model that, and being able to say things about that, I think, would be useful. Is that also in the plan? When we wrote to the chart that we we'd be considering, what a is in the network, what will be in the network, and, optionally, what was the network. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. So first of all, I agree on the topology thing, but I think you might be talking about cables which are physical and therefore there's a distinction but But the the only reason I raised the temperature points because you put power on, I think that goes.

First one, Nagel mentioned if we want to cover here the plant, So here, this will lead us to having not one inventory, but multiple, let's say, I don't know if we wanted to cover that or not. Okay. So far, I think we want we were covering the inventory of what we are what we have. Okay? The order is, okay, what I would like to have. And then then this this would require multiple multiple views of So here, politically speaking, I don't know if we are covered in that. I think we will stick to the first. No. I, I, I said the what's in the charter, not what that needs to go into the document. We can say, this document that just focuses on what is there, and then we can augment it with, future, the deployments or past deployments. Doesn't mean that everything needs to be in the same module in the same document. Okay. Okay. And, second thing is regarding the the 0 to reference just a kiss the course, the financials are expensive. So we should be careful for me, the the the reference should be always from from topology topology is something that you invent So it's something logic that we are inventing, would you configure something this this might be dynamic? And what is interesting is to point us to the to the current place. In inventory, whether whether this implies a license, whether this implies a device where this impossible device, I don't care somewhere to point to when there is a problem, but just avoid be careful with them, and because when I have seen the implementation get as low when when would you add to too many keys, yeah, around and we are"

So we had a we had a little bit passed, the the the timer that we allocated to this document, but I I think it's very good discussion so we can use the buffer that we at, at the end of cussions now. So we, you know, no worries that we'll be there will be room for all the presentations about It Let let's go on with the this discussion. To Diego Oscar and Benoit. Yes. Actually, in the in the second draft, we had also another model that was providing exactly the link, the reference between the topology and inventory. And the reason is exactly what Diego was saying at in the in the event that we focus on the physical aspects, the the capability or are are in the topology and then your reference. We made it a separate module because it was you don't always need to use it and on the discussion we had, we agreed to have another document for that document. For that. So it's not in the scope of this document. But there is other documents proposed to address this issue. And the idea is to navigate from the the Yep. Yep. Yep. It's it's aligned with the the agreement that we Alex. Yeah. So that is confusionary. Yeah. So I wanted to, comment actually on some of the, additional requirements and so forth that we see here mentioned from cable and the provisioning and all all of those sorts of things. To me, the relevance of this model is to provide the common anchor point but I would not necessarily put all this functionality in that because this simply becomes too much. I mean, it's something that can be used as a reference, but one thing that we talk about cables, earlier versus topology. I think cable, that's a completely different I think, because then you are getting into facility management. You need to basically know, basically, go, hey, where are cable docs, what have you, it's about. So you immediately have in a whole set of things which go way beyond the"

And similarly concerning from the the aspect is something expected that is there versus the actual I think actually that there's a very important operational requirement, but again, this goes beyond this, and this will require actually also a state model because This basically means that you're bringing to the picture, the whole synchronization aspect And if they if there's this discrepancy, how do you bring them back into Singh, who is right? Where's the golden store? Is it is it at the controller? Is it at a network device and so forth. There are more requirements that's coming from that. So I would not overload this model with this. Just treating it as an anchor point and then adding these things as additional work items at some later point. Rob Wilson, Cisco. Feeling slightly fragile this morning due to Benoit last night, so thank you Benoit. Want to make 2 points. So one of the things I would like to say is in terms of, like, time of working does with an AD hat on. This is, I think, the one sort of piece of work is obviously clearly in charter and we should spend as much time as we need to to progress this piece of work So I think the other doctors is good, in terms of context of them of understanding base model should look like, but I think we want to try and get the work group to get this work adopted done, finished, and then move on to the work. And then I've got a comment in terms of actually on this model, I'd like to understand how you sort of extend it. So one of my sway in Yang is you put augmentations in, over and over and over extra functionality in. But in terms of like the component what that'll mean is that every component will end up with all those properties. So you may want to have, like, a choice statement that's to, like, the the class of object you're representing the inventory so you can sort of split out the different properties and only tie those to what you represent So you wouldn't see, like, hardware related properties in component that's related to software, for example.

I also have comments about apology and probably people mention that already, but I just wanted to summarize, like, you know, we are looking at, best says we are looking at guidelines how to connect topology to different functional blocks. You know? So we are looking at you know, we have to connect configuration. We have to connect to inventory. We have to connect KPIs. My worry is if we have different drafts and different working groups. You know, that's, we won't have a consistent approach So my recommendation for to both us, like, can we bring it to the to the same working group, all of those, layers, different layers, and how we extending it and then align it to to be done in a similar way. Like, let's say Oscar is doing, OSPF and ISIS in terms of thing attributes for that layer into specific containers that are named based on the network type, I think. So so there are recommendations that we want to follow. You know, so maybe we have to discuss whether we want different drafts in different working groups about how to connect to apology, well, to bring them all together into the same group. Thank you.

So do you guys have a plan for how you manage this? So this one, is exactly based on the on the document. Yeah. In Ccamp, a while ago, we started working on, inventory for optical. But it was impossible to do inventory for optical without a core model. So we started working on a core model as well. We adopted that in Ccampa, we were perfectly aware that, that was not the right place, and the sooner or later, we add the 2 shop the generic part out of the document.

So And but this inventor topology model because this is this, name actually is just captured from the discussion from the IV entering meeting. So right now, we call it a mental topology, but We received some comments that that this ementered pot topology seems not that clear, but, our intention here is we want to define a physical network topology that you can use when you're doing overlay and underlay correlation, that apology can provide, like, inventory references. Or some other information, from the bundling network. So next slide, please. And about this topology modeling, currently, we had we had at that just to mention because there's, topology there. There are so many information has been collated. And this RC, 8345 provide a very basic a very general base to provide a abstract network topology have the nodes, links and termination points. The nodes can be physical devices or or 2 devices can also even be the SDN controller note So here in our model, we're trying to established, 1 to 1,"

They don't have that information, But here in our model, we're trying to build that relationship with interface. So that the interface can cover layer 0, layer 1, those kind of interface information. So next slide, please. So here, I'm giving, example of how that inventor topology can be used because right now, in the service attachment points dropped there's already have some reference like, this service attachment points some customer facing ports. That can be attached to latest 3 VPN surveys. Their 2 18 service, or even slice service. That the points the the the service can be like, attached. And now it has has a parent termination point there that defined, but underlying, there's not information for the, like, service provisioning, So this model can provide like, information at imentered by port information and also the interface information for the SAP of, CEP network can be correlated this information, So"

That's Iterabuzzi, I have I think you are addressing 2 requirements with this draft, and I would suggest you to split. What requirement is the need to have a physical network topology view, which is coming from the additional map, and I think it makes sense to to address it. And the second requirement is to be able to navigate from a apology to the inventory. And I would suggest to skip to speak with you because, what we didn't seek was you can't reference it from any topology. So we'd, he's we would be good to know to mandate, people to implement the physical methodology if they want to navigate. For example, you can navigate, from an internet, link termination point in the layer to directly to the physical if you don't want to positives. It's it's a it's a department choice, sir. So if you can split this to into two dollars, you will see it will be more flexible people to deploy. I know for it, there are examples of the problem where people do not today deploy the physical methodology, but they may still want to know which is the physical component that is associated to any an internet port in the internet, the layer to topology. So if you split it, you have a more flexy way to to use this, to to to address this to requirements, yeah, I think we can think about that. So that your proposal is about not complex. 2 requirements into one model. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, boy. I already mentioned some of things, to you, but I'll I'll repeat them here. Like you mentioned the the naming of inventory topology as as something that, maybe too generic and and, providers with some time operators"

The second comment is, maybe to reuse the patterns of how your group attributes. Based what was done in layer 2 and layer 3 and it was the F and I size where we have a containers for the but it's very easy in the instance to see where they belong. And the third thing about interface, you know, you are mentioning interface at this Evan, you know, but we do need to have a generic approach how to connect to the interface at all of the layers. And I won't repeat the comments that I mentioned earlier. And I also think what it this really good comment because we may want from Leo 2 to go directly to inventory and not have labor. Depology. Thank you. I will go from my future. I just quite confirmation when you refer to physical topology. Does the node has always a one to one a map to a physical, to a network element, or because I my understanding is node is a different abstraction from the network element to where it's possible you have a network element that can that can, be in multiple notes in a topology, Right? And you have you could have 2 or multiple network elements that form the same node in the in the topology. So I saw that example, you show the yamamoto has just a one leaf ref. So do you I agree.

Before we start on this draft, I'd like to talk a little bit about the evolution of power management. When we first started building network devices, you turned them on and they consume a certain amount of power. And they'll consume that amount of power whether they're saturated with traffic. We're doing absolutely nothing. Well, that may not have been a bad idea. 30 years ago when power was cheap and climate change wasn't an issue. But it's a horrible idea today. We need to manage the power of that. Our network devices consume So there are a couple evolutionary stages we go through. The first is a stage in which a component of a network device can be powered on and off by a controller as it's needed. So let's say you have, 5 cross type cards and a router. And the router isn't very busy. You can power down one of them. And save some power. By the way, when you save some power on that, you also save some power on cooling because every what you bring in to a point of presence for running a device you need to bring another, wash to cool it down. Okay. So the first evolutionary stages, the ability to turn off components 1 at a as you don't need them. The next is network elements that themselves can power things down when they're not needed. A network element can look at its own usage and say, hey, I'm not very busy. I don't need all five lost connect cards. I'm gonna power one down. And that that's a stage of development.

A controller will know this cross connect card consumes a 100 Watts. This port consumes, you know, 50 watts, whatever. The next is to allow the management plane to comp put a component into power safe mode if possible. To turn off a cross connect card when it's not needed if possible. The next is to model functional dependencies because between components, Now right now, we have a way to model containment to say that This port is contained by this line card. We don't have a way to model functional dependencies. That says This port, relied on this cross connect card. Even though it doesn't physically contain it.

Power safe capability. This is a read only. This is the way that the device tells the controller, whether it can go into power save mode next slide. Automatic power management. Again, it's read, write, This allows the controller to override the device's automatic power save capabilities. If you wanna do the power saving on the controller and not let the device do it, you sent this to true. Next. Functional dependencies, this is different from containment, which we already have in the model. In containment, you say a a wine card contains a port. They physically contain each other. Here, there isn't physical containment, but there is a dependency. So that way, you know, not to power something down of something that it depends on that needs it.

Look at it as a traffic planning. You actually augment it from, interface, young data models. So my impression is is like a device level model. So whether it is a device lever or network lever, Yeah. Oh, We modeled it as network metal level because we were thinking about routers that only only operate at the IP level, but maybe you have a point that it should be at the device level. Yeah. So follow-up question, you know, traffic load, you can, you know, mayor the traffic load for each interface. I, This may trigger the, you know, energy consumption, automation, against the so So I'm just wondering whether, you know, these traffic look for each interface will trigger the you know, consumption, automation, or you will calculate all the trip totally traffic loader for all the interface and then then then then then triggers a, energy consumption automation. Yep. Think what you're saying is that maybe it shouldn't be hanging off the interface. Yang model. If you could send an email to the list suggesting where where we could hang it, that would be a good idea. Okay. I will post through to this. Thank you. Thank you. One comment from my side would be when we were speaking about, power consumption, is there a real difference between a device model and the network model?

Cell palmetto, Cisco, if I can make a comment to that, the base model for the network consumption of a power is given by the network elements, right, by the all the then this is kind of a derived metric that we should think about or but I just wanted to make a comment or or just another, is an ad, right, wrong. And, Toni, we are working on, another draft is called PowerF. It was presented in ops. We ask for, the reception on that working group. It was a a positively accepted, Janan mentioned that the impact program is working as well. On discussions. We are, also working with Alex on the green metrics. I think it will be good. We have some attributes that are touching some of the concept that are here. But I understood before putting power into the opsa working group we are also touching an static component that we believe it should be more linked to the inventory but it is also difficult to bring, bigger picture to put once in only one working group.

That's, do you want to use lead state data model to report these power consume, in real time or or something else, And I think that there will be a lot of notification if you want to report the power consume in real time. And the next question is, I saw you, define dependency component in your data model, and currently, your job is working on the power consumer, management have concerned that there could be multiple, a lot of features, that they have some other, dependency So do we need to define some other data model if they have, for example, service quick, creation, for example, the the cheaper car has some, dependency on, on some line card. And then do we also need to defines such such such, such, such, such, such, such our, data model to define this, dependency. Okay. Okay. So empirical, information. Power consumption is dynamic However, it's not incredibly dynamic. Most of the devices we looked at use you know, 100% of their power when they're saturated And when they're totally idle. Maybe 75 or 80 percent of their power. So, yes, there's a little dynamic behavior, but not very much."

So you define some, dependency component for, power management you raise a example that, some car is relate on some line car. So it is, sir, this does a dependency relationship. So I my concern is that we have a lot of features not only power management, but also for example, service configuration and also perform and monitoring So do we need to define our, some other drive or data model to define those dependency. Because, for example, for the performance monitoring or service configuration, they have different dependency. So I don't think so. And the reason why is a port relies on, say, a cross connect card regardless of what services are running, whether it's bare IP or L3 VPN or to VPN Really, there weren't that many components and there weren't very many service Reliance components. There are a few there are a few covenants that rely on services. That that particular service relies on, but really we we can do without, modeling them because it just makes the model to come Lex. Okay. I I prefer, maybe you can define the dependency in a more generic approach so that if there's some other dependency and different feature, they can extended or reuse your structure. Okay? Okay.

You you you that's debatable, but once you agree on that, I think that be perfectly fit into the inventory. Is it something It's an information you go. You call your inventory. Hey, this device, this card, this port, this static information? That's really fine. Then the other I think is more telemetry information.

Inventory, meaning power management that you read on it that only data sheet. That that's inventory. If you started speaking about, like, a real time consumption, etcetera.

And this concerns basically in the ability it's basically about mounting yang defined information from remote data source We had a couple of discussions also here at the IETF this week and that this may be actually not a not ideal name. It's really about providing a federated data store capability, and then really allowing for use in applications such as inventory. Next one, please. So, the motivation for this work is that the young data source actually provide local management data, to the, basically, the the server, which is a represent. So they have a device level scope. But increasingly use cases appear specifically also here in Ivy, that require a more holistic and network view. And, I mean, this includes the inventory topology, digital map, and so forth. And what this means is that we're talking about providing yeah, data model information at the controller level appear part of which basically really refers to some of the information which also, maintained, basically, in the in the network. And so therefore, basically, Some of this information is redundantly represented as part of management hierarchy. If you will that, that we have here. Next one. So, the issue is with this is that, well, 1st of all, basically, we need redundant model definitions model things once at the device level, once in the context of the network context, basically from from gets worse when you to augment these.

And, Next one. So and basically, this so according to the concept of fee amount, or maybe we'll probably rename it to Yang Federation. The idea is that you allow data nodes in one model for instance, owned by a controller to refer to data nodes at subtrees, which are in mode data stores such as, those provided by individual network devices.

So, essentially, the analogy is to have, to that of multiple and it distributed 5 some pretty much, I mean, there are some, obviously, some yeah, so so some some slight differences, but that's the the mental model. This is why you're basically along with the controller level to get a federated data store the treats and network as a system, and, which allows you to, for instance, augment or have maintained or have a view of network inventory, which is fairly static popular in the controller, for instance with a live, monitoring view and so far that you have insight in Next, please.

So this is just a basic usage example, actually, for details referred to to the data. But, essentially, the the idea is that you're provides these mount points or these federation points that you define as part of points, your your controller data model, perhaps your your your inventory, listen and support, And, within this, you basically indicate what information should go there from the remote system. So you're basically defining this, extension point, and you're saying, basically, what where to find the remote system that you're targeting.

Next slide. I'm Italian Spanish. So the process, what we did is that we looked at, all the layers that we focus on the IGP to start with. So let's say a use case such as capacity planning, or what if scenarios. And why we do this? Because there is this zoo of all augmentation of the young module.

So at different layers, that's what I'm telling you. There are different use cases. And we need to provide the view for those use cases. Does that make sense? So, yep, Absolutely. So the digital map is not, for example, a model. So it's pass me the term box inside which, you define in some use cases. And then you see if those use cases can be manage that with existing models. If not, you are defining the augmentation So that matters. Am I right? Something like that. Yes. It's a shortcut, but with the time, yes, that's good enough. So if we go to the next one, So we discover some limitations. Let's make keep that one because I want to focus on Ivy. Next one. So this is why why I had this presentation here, because when I saw, network topology. A confusing term to me. Alright? Because, for example, curate is that I would we could have L2 and L3 here. Well, I don't think so because this is about the inventory. So on the next slide,"

    "text": "The key thing, and I think it was Oscar mentioning this keys between all these databases is important. So we must have the keys the right way. So I believe that the key information that we must keep is network notes link permission points. And that would be the way to navigate through a different database that we have. Right? So that's why someone mentioned that we have 2 different shared between the inventory and how we navigate between different databases. So Okay. Good. Next one. So to my reading, it's about more inventory, that network inventory. So typically, if this working group be focusing, you know, on the ports. The fiber the chassis. This is what I believe Italo mentioned. Then that is the right focus. And now if we need to move to different layer, then we need to go via the 4 keys that I mentioned before. But we could find information. Not everything should be here. Accuracy mentioned it, for example, like a power consumption. Is this inventory? No, but as long as you've got the way to go through this, not not the idea to that interface and to find the poor consumption, then we're good. The thing that I still understand is the link with in the in the charter because, you know, yes, we must have a way to navigate was service. But it's not inventory. Right? So I make a clear distinction between getting the right keys, getting the right inventory, And from there, we take the keys and navigate to something else. I believe it's my last flight. So this is where I would focus the physical and, by the way, virtual IV inventory, then there are different ways to go whenever you go higher in the layers. So that's all I could do with the time I had. It was a little bit like in all direction, but Soviets."

    "text": "Very good. I'll be really quick. I made this comment in the chat I said layer 2 and layer 3 inventory here, not topology. Inventory here, layer 0 layer 1 in CCAP. That's just that's what I said. Not about apology. What is layer 3 inventory? Inventory of layer 3 devices, inventory of layer 2 device but not inventory of layer 1 or layer 0 here. And that's just because in my mind, whenever we say layer, 3 industrial map is that I want to see if from, a, I could reach see No. I I get that. Okay. Good. But my comment was let's not talk about you know, switches and AWS, and I'm wondering what else you know, here, here, let's talk about switch layer 3 switches and lay layer 3 routers and layer 2 switches and not layer 1 Dom. Whatever you call them. I think the sequences are in agreement with Yeah. Okay. Yeah. To the point of community, I'm a little bit confused because when I have to manage the inventory of a shelf, a board, flag, What's the difference between the fact that this board is performing a year 0 function or a utility functions. And what happens when I I ask if I start building an an a keyme, which is layer 01 layer 3 in the same network element. How do we manage this inventory? Or all the possible combination of the layers that you can figure out in the same any people. It's very has a lot of Fantas. You're doing that. And from another management, we don't see any difference. So why do we need to split between these two type of inventory side. It's very confusing to me. Well, probably it's it's more accurate to to say whatever is common fits into what Katie was, calling the"

I don't expect the modem to be to be genetic. And so I'm not gonna talk directly about your presentation, but, right, talk about the work group generally. I think it's great. We've got lots of people here a lot of interest. I think when I was trying this chance. I was trying to create a very narrow and focused as to what it does first and gets that done. And I'd like to try and get the working group again to focus on this, get the core model done, finish it looks to me like we will then need to re charter and work out what needs what should be in the scope of here, what should be in the scope of elsewhere. That might include things like maybe should we do the enhancements to to to apology models and things here possibly. I don't know. I do like the fact that we got people focused on this sort of problem area in one room, in one group, I think that's better than say, of CWG where it gets more spread out, more scattered. So I think that's useful. But I like to try and get the the focus on initially to get this Cornwall done and then we can have other drafts as well at the same time, but keep a lot of time focused on trying to get that one out of the door. And then at the same time, then we do have a discussion about like what the charter should expand to if that's the right Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Way forward. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, everyone. C0n Australia. It's a state. In theory and all that."
