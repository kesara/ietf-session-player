Thompson and mr. Horlick and sit down please thank you I could do these to put the band back together okay okay all right so this is special working group session um next slide we\u0027ve already got people have already volunteered for no takers Jean and John that\u0027s awesome and now the note well is this the new note well did you pull down the new one okay oh they sent a link like this week that\u0027s okay okay this is the old one okay every everybody should have already gone and read the new one okay and then Marie\u0027s gonna give you right you have the right to remain silent in this room anything you say can be used by the ietf if you have intellectual property rights or obligations you should consult with your attorneys before participating here or on any list or talking to a tease in the hall or any of those movies great alrighty okay no we have it okay so this is the deadlines for ITF 100 so you\u0027ve got a little over two months for Bob submissions tad over that to let the chairs know that you\u0027ve got something coming in and then the cutoff return of proposals really this is this is art your problem statement what problem do you want to talk about solving and and what deliverables you might have if we decided to solve that problem doesn\u0027t have to be an official official charter and then we will announce the topics we were remiss in doing it for this meeting and that\u0027s for 100 yeah yeah but we\u0027ll we will shortly update the wiki okay so working with the deadlines mm-hmm if you if you make the deadlines and obviously you\u0027re gonna get agenda time as long as the topic has had sufficient discussion and sufficient interest if you miss the deadlines you get into the AO B section if we have time we\u0027ll talk about it and it is super helpful for the chairs if you include your you know dry off - your name - dispatch it makes it a whole lot easier for us to just make sure we don\u0027t miss somebody because we do occasionally miss somebody okay mailing lists so artists for the art at IETF not org is for general "
