And also collecting some other inputs and also re reviewing some other aspects, and as I I expect to to refer to them during the presentation. So but, essentially, basing on use case draft. Next place. So, name, but in routing, as I stated on the on the Astrat refers to the calculating a path or a path through a network where the time of message transition or reception is part of the overall computation. So how understanding what are the what is the the impact of, potential schedule changes that we could have a lot of time. For that, We consider a network topologies that could be either or could have either intrinsic topological changes or occasional topological changes always predictable changes. I mean, that that I schedule on the time and, and, so how we have some notion of anticipation to this changes either intrinsic or, occasional. That could be the case of, topologies with, in, we have limited resources or or connectivity. Or situations where we can identify changes on the links or that the changes that could be topological changes that could be associated to the, to cost, as could be financial environmental cost, and, and so and also situations due to mobility. But, again, not random mobility. So how that we can associate some, idea prediction to those, changes. Inessa's situations where we could have losses of the links or new links, but also, again,"

We will discuss requirements based on, use cases scenarios I said. And this is, like, this is scenarios that was, related to resource preservation. That could be the situation of energy preserving presenting the energy consumption. Operating efficiencies or, for instance, consequence workflow migration, the fact that we could maybe reduce, topology footprint, maybe making some some links, going in the switch of mold, for instance, or also the dynamic reachability that could be the case the satellite scenarios or or some of the scenarios where the topologies are, are changed dynamically but in a flexible way, the document also defines a number of concepts about visibility of the, of the schedule changes, reality where there is. We will comment a little bit more on on the next slides, but where the the changes are generated or executed, and then some notions rare in the tobacco temporality in general.

So what is the horizontal this time, changes that we are considering? Depreciation of them, so the different granularity in terms of, of timing the periodicity. So what is the kind of sequence of changes that we can face along the time, they continue to use those changes. So it's if you need, let's say, revisited, or is on how do we have a kind of rule for, when this changes will happen. An interpolation in the sales that they're between 2 different changes if we there is a need of interpolating values because we could have, you know, in, in a sequence of changes, we could have some values predefined for the the different events. But if there is no need of, having some or they intermediate value, work within interpolation. That we can consider. So all of this is part of the of the document. Next, please.

Before you want, I I just do have a a question, with chair hat off. When we talk about the impact on routing protocols, these are not requirements or constraints that are being levied 12 routing protocols. These are configuration or deployment impacts.

Or, or that could come from from, I mean, not not intrinsic to, I I don't remember now the work exact port that we are using. Sorry for that. A, a digital kind of strange thing. So, yeah, the implications that could, Could have to to have this capabilities to the to run the protocols themselves. I think that we will commerited on more than in the, in terms of where we are generate the considerations of generating the the impacts or executing the impacts I think this is related to that, probably we can't comment on the next slide on this. Understood. And then with Chairhead, and and that makes sense. And then just wanna make sure that we don't have requirements on other routing protocols as part of this document. That would be a negotiation with other very soon. That's that's a point. Thank you. Okay. So, next, please. Yeah. So part of the discussion about is about the generation. So where we generate, the the time of schedule, Well, changes. Right? And here, we can we can consider to two ways of generating the the changes. A centralized manner where basically all is done in a central or stator, but that's how it can all synchronize with all the devices and and inform the devices about what could be the the let's changes get the the the, yeah, the the the schedule to apply to the the routing changes, or distributive in such a way that are the different devices, the one that generate by their own"

So from the orchestrate or to be informed to the devices. What are the the moment in which they need to change the, the the schedule, the routing. Sorry. Gotten information or distribute it so that the The The changes to the routing is, done by the network notes themselves, So, again, recapping generation that could be centralized for distributed and execution that could be also centralized executed. Here, for the execution, will depend on the capabilities of the routing protocols for operating the the the changes themselves. So it could be the the case that they're out in protocol has intrinsically this capability of, producing the like, a, populating the changes, let's say, or could be the case that's not depending on that, also, we will have this a different possibility. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Next place, So we also went in during the discussions, we we were considering, one of the aspects that can also impact the, so how the the scope of, of the requirements, One of them is they move you to main case. We you can see list there, free different assumptions that we did, but probably the the one what we have more discussion is about the multi domain. So essentially, what we stated is by now, we are working the requirement document, thinking that, The routing and the scheduling information, everything is on, constraint to a single administrative domain.

If we assume They monkey domain where they're just either the schedule or the routing could come from different domains or we are just have cross train to the single domain case. By now, we are considering the single case domain. Then also, we added as an assumption that we are not covering the random mobility events. So we are covering mobility events as in the charter, but those that are predictable advance. So not not the random at all. And, Also, we leave out of the scope of the document whatever impact that could, has to do with changes on the addressing of the notes and so on. This is the assumptions that we are putting on this version that were not in the, the previous version. I will comment at the towards the end in the complexions if we what to do with the multidemic case home? Next, please. So, Regarding the the content of the of the document, yes, we we highlight this, distributed centralized and hybrid scenarios. As mentioned before, we could have this centralized or or, distributed generation and execution of the changes. So this deal to different scenarios. This should be decentralized hybrid We also, includes some ideas of, implications that could come from a LEO satellite, public considerations. We list there are a number of graphs. That they somehow serve us to to source for having this with considerations. And, issues consider constraints that require for tambary and path computation.

Collecting the views from the for the growth in group on these assumptions. Next, please. So, We also spent some time on the security considerations where we were thinking on on this, and there are several considerations to to be that could not could have a potential impact on all all the DVR, stuff. Right? So things like, denial of service attacks or that malicious parties could manipulate or disrupt the, the time information be a serious attack. Also, that, the TBR information could be used for having traffic analysis or road prediction, for predicting network activity, for identifying a usual activity, for even all all the situations like time time spoofing or sus manipulation. So these are the cities, aspects to be considered And, yeah, basically, we started to to draft this section in the document, but for sure. Required more elaboration and probably the identification of further attacks. That could be maybe the the the the the clock itself and that we could somehow create, a very bad situation when once we are working with this, time barrier and routine stuff. Next, please. So as next steps, we would like to agree on the assumptions that we have taken, the multi domain problem is the more important one. To an outstanding week constrained by now the analysis to a single domain. Also, further discussion is is needed for the control plane applications.

So is every party allowed to propose some changes on the on the On the routing, in the 10 years who is scheduling the what is the actual schedule proposing the schedules or somehow trying to secure a securitize as well all these parts. And, yeah, operational considerations for how to manage the the TBR schedule between peers. If we need to consider class models, and, also what, what could be the impacts of on cross differentiation if we can assume that from the beginning that, the close of graduation will be fine or we need to do for to ensure that we synchronize the clock before starting to to to interchange messages for the script for a change in the the the routing.

I tried to think about this is like a more general TBR case. And then I'm thinking about, like, the satellite, normally card like a NTA non terrestrial network. We'll consider everything together here at talking about the end to end, basically like a hybrid or integration of TN terrestrial and the noun, and India, So it seems to me this one of all the requirements since you're only focusing on the PVR itself,"

So, certainly, we have been focused on the DBR staff. One of the discussions that we had for the NTM, and the was precisely going in the direction of the multidomain to to understand we can consider that everything is on a single domain. We we consider satellites or these open, the multi domain cates, The multidomain has implications for how to trust the information and how to trust on Yep. All the potential changes. Probably could be different approaches to that. So if there is, like, the, the nature of the satellite is it's it's changes in the topology are predictable themselves, probably there is not an I need I need interaction between administrative domains, then that would probably could be easily covered here. But if we need to have a kind of interaction between domains, then we opened the, the discussion on multi domain, and all that, all the complimentary aspects of the trust and and so on. So So, yeah, I think we need more discussion and supporting where we put, let's say, the the frontier. Because from that frontier, we will derive some ton impact on on the requirements that we will need to to work on. Thank you. Lee is in the queue. And one comment Yeah. So in time line scenarios, we also always assume that most of to already change, predicted about us. Sometimes maybe it's predict the information is not very correct.

Changes have not considered something in the middle. I'm not sure what extent we can assume yeah, what kind of accuracy on the predictability could be part of of TBR. We are talking in the requirements about the, yeah, the accuracy of the clock and the segregation of the clock that this is specific to the to the clocks, you know, let's say not to the to the to the time. But they, yeah, accuracy on the time estimation, Again, I don't know where would be the What would be the frontier to? What we consider something predictable or not predictable.

Oh, excellent. It's just a comment on the multi domain aspects. I put a comment in the chat I I My gut tells me that you're doing the right thing by focusing on the single domain requirements because I think it means this document can get written, completed, and and through to the IS in a in a sensible rate And then with that, understanding of the single domain problem can be tackled at a later date.

Thank Taking So hi again. Yeah, I represent this the silver draft. Is about the, the usage of Alto for exposing TBR information. Next place. Just a, as a recap of what is the, the proposition here, So the the the and the protocol which is, an IPF outcome incorporates a capability, which called Koscalendar. That allows to expose different, topological views. Around the time, right, with the, with the different schedule, timing, let's say, associated to that, to them. So the the idea of the draft was relatively to leverage on that capability for proposing an off path mechanism to advertise these changes of the poverty. So, program, so, a lesson party case could be, I mean, the focus, you know, it's not from the case itself, but the the possibility Oh, with this conscalendar, way of exposing information essentially, what yeah. Here, the the use case that is represented We will represent an intervention in our network where a technician identifies as a schedule change along the time. And with that, okay, we we can somehow in, infer the changes or the impact of those changes in terms of not only topological changes but also KPIs. Like, occupancy of the links or latency or whatever. And then you feed this information into Alto in such a way that Alto can expose that to external applications here."

What to do in terms of, for instance, injecting the the stream, the stream flows in the network. That will be more or less the case. Next, please. So the advantages of this, approach So, essentially, we're leveraging on this but capability, we kind of load the processing of changes from the network element itself. So it could be a a centralized component a culture, or the network controller, the one, understanding the impact of those changes, Then, also this approach allows to consider breake the changes due to the appearance of new nodes. So we can, in in that process of understanding the changes, we can just simply feed the fact that there will be new notes in the in the network or new links or whatever. So this is all is done from a decentralized component. In an easy way, basically. And, also allows because of the oath nature of that allows to expose these 2 applications to personal consumers. For sure, can be done also for internal consumers. We are thinking, I don't know, packet, mobile packet code or whatever. That can be done. But, I mean, be used for internal and external applications. Next case. So the changes from the previous version, we did on fixing all the detail, document it itself, we assess, we continue to do the ment of the of this proposal against the TBR requirements. In this case, that shows that version 1 because the version 02 was not yet ready.

So I tried get get okay. Can well, are you consider, like, some general of path solution. You know, Yeah. Well, in, in this case, in this case, we propose Halto Practically because Alto already incorporated the cost calendar for a matter of matter. Feature. So it's it's very straightforward. For sure. I mean, whatever other compound, let's say, let's call it. that could have viscoscalendar could be equally applicable, but, Alto being an outcome of IETF in operating this functionalities seems to be pretty straightforward. So the the integration with, other components, for sure, one basic integration will be with the network controller for retrieving the current status of the topology. So collecting that with a IETF, topology and model for instance. So We we need to understand that that is a a component for exposure, not for for, actually the network.

That is, by the way, that link between your, u e, your phone, and, genome be onboard, the facet that I call the service link. That link more is available but other link. The other link is, from the Genob about the, ground station. That is called the fitterling. So the 3 gppb is, investigating if both links are not available at the same time, So what can be done? Okay. So that means you you you'll do a text message. Not hacked massive will be stored somewhere on board. Somewhere. And then the the the satellite will start to move around until satellite can detect their ground station at some place somewhere At that moment, it's going to do the the tunneling the, the, the transformation from satellite. Should, to the ground network and the same Okay. This is like that. By the way, on the other direction, the message reply from other, users or from the on ground users can in the back. Though just the conflict that rewards passed. This is like the scenario first time for it. Now, get some very interesting part on the scene, Costa, you know, for the wireless, world, you know, when you have, a phone, not going to register with the network, the wireless network. You know, in wireless network, authentication and authorization is very important. So they're, separate the process of procedures."

That picture, but I borrowed from a proposal, from the 3 GPP. That is still being discussed, not being concluded. Yet. So if you look at, the, for data picture, toward the app It's about upper left corner. At that moment, your phone is connected connect, that is service, meaning connect to 1 satellite. But that satellite is not connected to a ground station that is on the the bottom right. So it's a diagonal, point. Note, So in that case, in that case, the phone, okay, will go through some situation but it cannot finish. Okay. And then the satellite will start to move. Toward the, like, the using the clockwise and go into the, the the top right and then go to bottom right. At that moment, the satellite can connect to the ground station. Okay. And then it's going up with some exchange message. Okay. The process will be done at least. Remember, this is just one way. Yeah. And then the satellite, the well, start continue moving and the the clock, clock wide direction. And then going back to the original part. The the top, the top left.

So it's way beyond. So the satellite cannot find our unique So even one wrong trip is not going to, work. In this case. So the proposal of the solutions in 3 g p p, okay, basically I say, okay, we have to use, I felt, use know, multiple, satellites. We which will be connected through interstata links.

The things here, actually, in the, the 5 gs, the 3 gs, 18, is already used things, Well, I can give one example. It's like, the, I called SCAI satellite coverage availability information. So basically to help with the discontinuous coverage. On non discounting or courage, those type of things. So meaning, so you have a u e you have a phone want to, connect it to to get away the service through the satellite, but the satellite may move So you can do some, in other ways. To do the calculation to say, okay, the satellite service will now be available in, I don't know, maybe, like, 1 minute, 2 minutes 5 minutes. And then all, it's going to be available in 1 hour, something, like that based on ephemerals. And then for that moment, for that period as the, phone you do not want to waste your power. So you can put yourself in the power streaming mode. Like, EDRX extended, discontinued reception mode. So such that your phone can last longer time. So that one is being used already in the, you know, in the spec a standard out of 5 gs. So I just gave saying, okay, that is very useful.

Of the pin, the correctional network, and NPN non correctional networks. So that's why it's okay. Well, based on our consideration of kind of things, with our experience and the the normal thing work from the 5 g You know, you know, wait for Paul cable. Maybe they are using layer. One thing is just like the regular IGP customer for those things but a node on the ground, they can do whatever they want.

So because of the service link, the UE part, all the ground station part, the fader link may not be available at the same time So for the ARPA link, for uplink or downlink, the text message has to be saved store somewhere, sampling, So for these things, okay, in order should have a consistent way to do the storage for text message. So the I UPL IUPF is there for the uplink. So the things that the text message will be saved on the IUPF. For the downlink, There are another UPS will be on on on the ground. So the eye mask When the IMessage message, it's rotten, from the N6 to that UPM, that UPM will do the storage and keep the fittering available. So here, We have the IUPF and the and the PSC UPF.

That's I may admit that's LEOs compare with higher OpEx, satellites seek, got natural advantages of low latency because you're more closer to the surface of the earth, but the key are significant problem that we need to handle is that the relatively high velocity compare relatively to the surface So there may be, many academic discussions like the virtual routers, configured SE orbits or some, other mechanisms And the second comments I want to"

Had a discussion with them, and cuss the IPF schedule young module, they are trying to define a very general proper schedule. And There are some information with think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, Might be a little bit complicated for us. So, for example, the time zone, So the question here to the Community here is Do we really want to support a time zone or is UTC enough? So if we just support the UTC only, It's simpler, but you will have to use UCC time only. The time zone will make it More flexibility more flexible, but that also means complexity. Correct So, Another thing is so for example, right now, the duration is used a regular expiration. And the TBR schedule off. Well, the all stars. We talk about this. We think, Seconds. You know, the duration expressed in number of seconds is good enough for us. So we are the the Our point of view is we are trying to start from a single schedule. That meet meets our requirement. Meets can do the mercy to mercy communication. And we try to keep it simple. Best."

We need to make the requirement of this schedule. Very clear. So What way talk about and what our understanding is you know, we try to make case simple. So it's already expressed there. And what the the I kept, I kept schedule. Beyond all sorts. They will carve out a grouping specifically for us. So right now, we are thinking, you know, We will gonna change the start time to UTC only. That also means the the boundary. Like, if we you you define your schedule until what time that will also be UTC only only If you think you need more than this, Please speak up. Cents. And then having said that, we do have someone in the queue. Yeah. that I think that didn't know if you were soliciting feedback slide by slider at the end. I can wait. I think I Just hold on. To you. Oh, okay. Just a moment. Yeah. And I think that's pretty much what we have. And we really want to make sure we understand the requirement. Make sure that's exactly what we want to define. Okay. Please Eric Klein. Yeah, thank you for going back to the slide. In my personal experience, time zones make everything worse. Yes. Everything works. 100%. Exactly. And and and not only that, date time start, is not a good name. If you want it to be UTC, you should call it UTC start time. So that is perfectly unambiguous. It cannot be"

I I I haven't I haven't I haven't completely up to date. What is the difference between interval and duration? Is interval the interschedule spacing, we should you just below frequency, and above the recurrence bound, what is interval Oh, because I I mean, I tend to think of the interval as the as the as, like, the start time plus the duration. So I'm not quite clear if there If it's the same thing That's the group defined in the IETF schedule. Dot young. So the right now, there are we may consider removing that one That's the work going on between the authors of this draft and the grouping definition. Right. So that's what I meant. They we talk about to them, and they are going to just write one grouping for us. With simple grouping, of course, our grouping can be used by other models if they want to use just a simple schedule. We didn't want to use the waste, like, a very complicated start time and Like, for example, you can do every Monday or one man, like, first day of each month, those sort of things. We try to keep this simple. You wanna keep it truly simple, you can get rid of all of the recurrence logic altogether. If you want to recur something, then something schedules it the the control system schedules it recurring What currently. Yeah, you are saying there was just one slot, one slot after saw the right number. If I want if I want something to happen every Monday, then On Sunday, something says do it next do it tomorrow. The next Sunday, something tells me, do it tomorrow. Do one again. You know, rather than tell me to do it with a recurrent schedule. Want it to be truly Yeah. Yeah.

Because, if we use many schedules for only one interface or on a special interface maybe in some schedule, the late set you should up. The yinssome schedule is is that you should talk. So, maybe the schedules may be overlapped. So how do we know If we issue the 2, for the interface or node. So for the overlap case. Okay. So if you configure your router, say, okay, I 2 schedules. Schedule 1, schedule 2 at exactly the same time, 2 different things. Which one would you prefer? The later one or you the router cannot pick 1. Right? It's really up to the management. If you say Theoretically, if if it's up to me, you're scheduled to shoot. Oh, we're right. Schedule 1. Yeah. And now we know that, one interface can be use the yin several top topologies. Right?

Hello, Brian, Zebra's APL. I did get some feedback on this. I think this is a good, starting point, and I gave the feedback on the mailing list. One thing that I think would be valuable both for this and for the TBR requirements would be To relate some of the behaviors here to those aspects in section 3 of the TV requirements, to be able to explain Some of the choices that were made here in those terms that we're trying to define, I think that would help help both documents.

It's time varying cost. You might be some high balance. Sometime lower relatively lower than some other time. Is that the what they are trying to ask? Yeah. I mean, right now, you just have bandwidth delay. I mean, the question was Are you going to extend it to other metrics as well? Or is there a generally, they are doing it. That's the next step. Right? So right now, we only have very basic definitions in both the node module and the topology module. We are trying to get this scheduled thing clear first. And then so then later, if we want to add 1 more attributes with schedules that's We'll just add more. Okay. Another scoping question, the schedules are applied only at the node and the link or or, also looking at maybe a component level It can be a component level.
