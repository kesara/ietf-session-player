Well, we want to use less power, and we also want to run those searches as part of the CICD pipelines that run 1000 and 1000 of tests. The other problem is the DUT in SUT. And this is actually the one that took us the longest. In fact, We've been in operation for 7 years. MLR search got, start started to work on them in our search, about 6 years ago, and I think that's where we started to produce the draft about 5 years ago or so. And it is this problem, the DUT and the SUT, you look at the definitions of, the UT and SUT, him, in RSC 2285, and 2544. DUT is the single networking device that is exposed to the the stimulus, SUT on the other hand is a combination of those devices. In our case, we have the SUT that called server hardware. With operating system, a number of applications run-in parallel to our software DUT. Of course, we can do a standalone test, and that's what started. That's how we started the journey. But, at the end, it is actually the real deployments are like that So the way we go about it, we basically recognize the fact that the UT subject of of interference from this other things, and it's also sharing the hardware sources It does exhibit fluctuating performance, and we actually characterize the performance as as spectrum."

We are after discovering the noiseless because it is representing closer or is a closer summation of the actual DOT performance. 3rd problem is, their applicability and comparability. And, you have when you operate in the noisy environment, 2544 and, bisecting tends to, wander away from the the region that we are really interested in. And depending on you know, on the environment you're testing in, the sources of noise may be slightly off So you end up with different results. And when you look at software networking benchmarks over the last 7 years. You can actually see that, whether these are open source labs, whether these are people in OPNV Linux, distributions, it's it's very it's very visible. So the way for us to to address that is, again, to provide to report the spectrum And, And if we solve the the DUT in the CT problem, we expect to also improve the repeatability and comparability of the results.

So the non serial loss is sort of accepted in software whether we we like it or not.

Those optimizations were changing quite a bit between those versions. So in this draft, I'm focusing just on this specification, which is the bare minimum that users or implementers would need to follow so that they reap the benefits wild leaving them freedom to apply different optimizations. Okay. Next slide, please. So, that requirements, in the specification are mostly in the form API application programming interface.

Unconditional not compatibility. Let's think, for RFC 2544, there is set of values, that when the user uses the return value is really the throughput that's defined in RFC 2544.

So the video that is reported at the end is closer to the noise less part of the spectrum which we what's investigate because this is closer to the idealized DOT performance, it is also more stable. So that are repeatability and comparability.

Just a one slide summary our goal is So we'd like to to give you a benchmark in methodology"

And with bidirection traffic, it's it's a problem to to benchmark them. First of all, we'd like to make it possible to to perform the classic, best, like throughput, framelesslade, and latency, Pakidari, and, etcetera, and we want to add some further performance metrics, like maximum connection establishment rate, connection team grounded and connection tracking table capacity to measure the states for parts of the a thing and we have to take special special care to the RSC 4814 children on important numbers. Of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, Yeah. They are problematic in both sides. So if if, we just you spelled on the numbers inbound direction in a stateful case, just, inputs a lot of connections to the connection in cable and it exhausts capacity. The other direction, if you just invent further import numbers, they just packets which don't belong to any connection, then it'll get dropped. And the test fails. It's really a problem. So the program itself is partially here. We are we believe we're coming to the end of this progress And for today, I just wrote a few examples about the validation of the methodology because we believe it works Bell, Bell, Bell, Bell, now, now And I just brought a few slides as a reminder perhaps you many of you have already laughed and, you know, you know, the methodology but maybe some of you not. So I just give a short summary of using a few slides about the main the highlights of the draft. So here is an example out methodology work with any IP version on both sides. But the example uses stateful and 8064. So in the left side, I'm not sure if it is a plays a pointer. It works."

But I I will just, tell you better better to look So, there are 22 devices, the test and the device on the test. On the left side of the tester, views IP version 6 and the right side use IP version 4. And on the left side, because it's initiator because it can initiate new connections it sends some IP version 6 packets. With certain port numbers, and IP addresses, and it goes through device on the tests. It does the state for analytics for translation. It stores the connections in the connection tracking table, and it emits. IP version 4 packets, which arrive back to the tester, and the tester. It's, part is called Responder. It collects the 4 tapas. I mean, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination, port numbers and it stores in its state table. And using them from the state state table, of course, but that's helping source and destination, it will be able to to send valid packets are IP version 4 packets that belong to an existing connection in the connection to him table. And they can be translated back to version 6, So the measurement works in 2 phases. There's phase 1, which serves 2 purposes. The connection tracking table of the device under test is filled. And the state table. The responder is filled with rate for tappers. Is the condition to be able to to send packets in the reverse direction. I mean, we need the direction that traffic because I have seen 2544 requires that. And this 1st test phase can be used without a real second phase just to measure the maximum connection asymmetrate. And it must be if if it if phase 2 is used, it must be used together with phase 1. And"

And it's the idea for the connection, maximum expect is the exclamation days measurement and the other extent situation when the test frame is not a new connection. It is good for the classic test throughputting and so on and so on. So how can we achieve them? It's very simple. For every elementary test, we have to, use a large enough and empty connection to any table and be be use the round bone, elimination of all possible port numbers. Which are unlimited, the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, 1st phase, and we use properly high time mode value, and then it the the the conditions are guaranteed. As a proof of concept, old measurements have been implemented in in SIIIT Perth. The source code is available until Ed. Ed.

So these are the measurement environments, were 2. Their servers interconnected by, 10 gigabit, links with direct cables, And one of them is a tester and the other is a device under a test. Shown in the previous, figure. Here are the results. So, besides those things which I, shared, that's a very important issue is scalability. There are 2 kinds of scalabilities of them is scrapability, the number of CPU cores. Of course, you know that currently, the, cost frequency of the CPUs cannot be raised, but they increase the number of CPU cores. And we would expect that, adding more cores, increase the performance of the system. It is critical to check if if if if it is so or not. So in this case, the measured value was the production and segmentation is for Jewel and, we tested it by 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 CPU cores or by doubling the number of course. To to cover a a wide range with the low number of measurements. And Airways is just the difference of the higher bound and upper bound of the binary search when we stop, Of course, we can do it until 1, but we just want you to save some time. And and and and be repeated to all the tests ten times. And median, minimum, maximum, calculated, you can see that minimum maximum not quite close to media. So the lots were quite stable. And you can see the scalability here that from one core to to 2 core, to course be the 2 performance in case by, 59%, And, again, we used 8 course. So for 4 courses of 2 course, increase was 27%. But after that, the increase was much lower. So scrapability was yeah, acceptable, not not really good, but moderate."

The same settings, but it's not throughput in the 2nd phase national EBITDA is traffic. And the number of all packets are displayed here. So we can see similar trends that up to 4 walls. The scalability was quite good or acceptable, but after that, practically no no scale up. It was a classic, performance metric. And you can see the other part of scalability is even more critical in the case of stateful implementations, and usually people say that this is the problem of the states for things that if we increase the number of connections, will not scale up well. So, to cover a wide range with a new number of measurements we, increased tenfold number of connections. So first, 4, 400,000 and then 4,000,000 40,000 connections. And you see, it was achieved by increasing number of source ports numbers. The destination port numbers and the source port numbers for kept, fixed, and again, you can see that there's some degradation You can see first, 20, 20, 3% and then 26% regulation, But I think it's as acceptable. So if we increase the tenfold, It's not so bad. But it's the property of jewel, but is, relevant for us nowadays works. And, of course, it was a maximum connection installation rate. Now you can see throughput, throughput, they show quite similar trends and seas. So the lesson to learn is that measurement work well.

Specific to stage forecasting, it is the connection tier downgrade. So a connection setup is one end, and the connection t down is on other end. We tie it out with the connections. Unfortunately, we can measure it only as a aggregate measurement. It means that we insert number of connections into the connection to him table of the of the device on the test and then did the entire connection tracking table. We did it with some out of a method. In fact, in case of jewelry, we just remove the kernel module. And measure the time by it last date.

And and In fact, this came from the experience with the previous one, because we experienced that with open BSD, we just, got some poor results and reinvest the case, and we come to the conclusion that that not only with stateful, but also with state like that. This point in, using multiple IP addresses, in benchmarking. Now we'll propose a a a new draft and, some kind of amendment of the RSV 2544 and RSC, 4814 methodologies, So first of all, the what I talk about is the first is the problem description by I believe that we need testing with multiple IP accuracies and then the recommended solution how we can do it. So the program does take up shot. Of course, you, remember that RSD 2544 just just define the test frame floor mat, It's contained fixed IP addresses and fixed port numbers. It's meant that the manufacturers of the test devices could resend always the very same test frames. It's a very convenient. However, then came, I see 4814 which require using golf, using golf So tell them both important numbers. But in the case when Of course, I have seen a 2544 required testing with one IP as a space pairs first and then using 256 destination networks, choosing cloud normally. But when only a single destination network is used, it caps using single IP address pair. And also came receive side scaling. Which makes it possible to receive multimillion packets Bye, let's see, the Linux server of any device. Using multiple CPU calls."

    "text": "And it has 2 kind of implementations. First thing, one of them is that that when all both IP addresses and both port numbers including the hash function, which is used to to hash the interact to CPU calls. And the second implementation is a bit simpler. It, yeah, just uses the IP addresses source and destination IP addresses doesn't uses the port numbers in the hash function which maps the interrupts to the CPU calls. And here comes the problem, is a problem of unfairness. So if we use NFC 48, 14,000,000 important numbers, together with the first ISS implementation. There's no problem. It works perfectly because the port numbers, just give some Entropy. However, if you use ifc40, 14, 10 known board numbers, together with the second kind of error has implementation, It gives both results because no entropy. Because, the port numbers are not used. Then no no multiple IP addresses. And Usually, it means that if you use bidirectional traffic, only 2 CPU calls I used one for one direction and one for the other direction and the others are just relax and don't do anything. However, if we use these boxes in forwarding their traffic, they work perfectly because they have different IP addresses and there's an entire entropy and everything goes back. It means that there's a gap which we have to fill in to make the avoided test conditions better to, approximate better the conditions of of into traffic. So The idea is very, very simple. It's just to apply the idea of RFC 4814 which recommended multiple and certain important numbers, which would use multipencil 911 IP addresses. And there are two questions What ranges can be used and but ranges should be used."

There's 4 but in IP, version 6 is not no no such problem. So he is when only only the destination networks are fixed. Have only the last eight bits. To express, different, agencies, But when we don't use, multiple networks, we can use last 16 bits. So it's not not a with program. And, of course, with IP version 6, we have plenty of an almost range. So no no such problem. And the other thing is But, ranges should be used. On the other hand, it's not sure that we should use as many as possible because it's can give a lot of entropy and it can hash properly. However, if you use too many, It, may have this downside because of the NDP or or RRP tables, And if there are too many elements in that, and if you use more than a few thousands of them, maybe the performance will be degraded, and I had experienced that. So we should have a good recommendation I don't have yet. So there's a working code. Are implemented. You can test it if you want. And my question, if If you agree that problem at all exists. And do you think that is proposal. So is the problem. And if you have any ideas, suggestions, I'm I'm really happy if if you share it. Thank you. Come on. Comments. Yes. Yeah. It's okay.

Your your work came from the knots, I guess. From the stateful testing? Yeah. But I I might be the the the problem during the net testing. Yeah. But it it happens also when I do the router testing. So when I measured open BSD, the singular is is called multiprocessor or a single processor corner and multi processor corner was not really better than single processor corner.

You are going also to augment Yeah. RFC 254 to address another costs. I think they they ought to go now, but maybe we forget Yeah. They are. For sure. For sure.

And, the other issue is when we focus on trending, like comparing, different bills of, same software it is important that, results are repeatable, but with some mix, some drivers. The RSS key is not constant in this random. And sometimes when you have a bidirectional traffic, you do not get gets 2 cores working, you get only one core. Receiving both and calculated false. So then you see, fake revision and progression. And, that is the main reason is is that we really try hard to have multiple flows even if they are encapsulated. Thank you. I'm I'm I'd point out for echo, though, that that at some point as a tester, you can't control the the system under test. And so if as an implementation, it to see as one core or multiple course as a tester if I don't know that, I think it leaves you with that that that dilemma that we run into sometimes in BMW G around, do you design the test for the tester or for the for the SUT because you know the architecture in general, we usually lean towards writing for the test in the sense that Look, you might, as a vendor, know your architecture well, but you don't know every other architecture on the market. And so trying to write for the architecture makes that hard. And so a tester, I think, just noting that this is what you observed, and here's why you think that might be happening.

And if this key is randomized at boot time, repeatability may be impacted. I think that's a a good comment. Sarah, to your point, I think in software networking, we definitely are paying attention, to the resources used, specifically CPU course. Logical course, physical course. Are not closed systems. These are open systems. And it is by configuration that one can enable 1 or multiple course. Flow distribution into those scores is a very important aspect of, benchmarking any software networking system. So I partially agree with what you said that, you know, we designed the test. To to test a generic type of DUTs or SUTs. However, those the UTs and SUTs are configurable In hardware, you don't usually specify the resources. In software, you do.

So, very quickly, something that we have already presented in the past, you know, that segment rooting, leverages the source routing. Paradeem, and you can implement, segment routing on 2 different data plays. So MPLS is the subject of this draft and the ipv6, which is the subject of the draft that will be presented by Edward, in a few minutes. We I've already highlighted that as of today, we don't have a standard method to benchmarking segment rooting. So there is something the base for our work, which is RFC, 5695, which is the benchmarking of, I will say, plain MPLS. We just needed to leverage on a 5695 to make, you know, evolve the benchmarking methods we have to take into consideration all the standards. You see, listed here, not just 5695, but all the standard, related to the benchmarking of a, networking device. Based on that, we have implemented a draft that we are discussing right now. Let's see if now it works Find heat. Not at Jupapis. Can you move forward. Okay. Update from the last IETF. So probably you remember that we presented and discussed a version 00 6 of the draft.

Otherwise, reading the draft and trying to understand implement a different test that you had to also read the the associated documentation. So to read the other draft specifying details of the different tests. So we decided to, let's say incorporate as much text as possible into the, SRMPLS relevant draft, so that we have a sort of standalone You can read it and have almost all the details. There's one exception, which is the discussion around the buffering tests, but simply because the text in RFC, 90 4 is too long. Otherwise, we have, to copy and, paste the I will say too many pages of text. Thanks to the the work done by, Bruno we've decided to remove also some duplicated text which was, I would say, useless in the description of, how a surplus works. And, also, we decided to extend let's say, the discussion around, about the, it throughput test.

So more than 2 which is also means, more than two seats. You see here the description of the, the throughput for world in benchmarking test So we have to, take into consideration that modern networking gear are so powerful. They can support such a a huge throughput that in some cases, need more than 1 test this, to perform the actual test. So we have to combine, you know, the this top, decide how many ports you need how to distribute the workload across the different ports So that's the simple design that that we have taken from. The text of the draft. And the point here is how you determine the something that we already discussed, this morning. So the the 0 frame loss test. So you keep on raising the throughput until you detect that you are about to discard some packets. So that's the point where you determine that we have overcome this 0 frame loss.

But probably for the forwarding benchmarking, this is specifically useful So that's why, specifically, Bruno, one of the co authors asked to do let's say, or better to explain clearly that a specific protocol stack should be highlighted.

So I have a concern regarding this slide because for me and test is an autonomous device, which can decide if it raises or lowers the rate. And if there are 2 independent testers, it may happen that, one of them, sense is lost because those ports, ports, produce some loss, and the other there is no loss. So one of them will raise and they'll be lower. So I would I would suggest a different drawing physical testers, and there's one logic which controls all the testers. Thank you. Okay, Gavin. Yes. Good point. Clearly, those are not completely independent. Otherwise, you are right. You may lose configuration or 1 of the 2, but, actually, it's a good suggestion.

For the advanced applications, let's wait maybe for another drafted. We want to acquire it first experience on what we are describe me here.

It is true they are kept in sync when we look for a a change or we have requested to add something We double check both both drafts. But after the work we have done, from version 6 to version 8.

I'd like to go ahead with that if the war group, is happy and if there is a If there's an interest, that's one.

We don't usually do those. I'm a little concerned about attendance. But we could propose to put those 2 things on the list, the s r drafts, And your item there, magic. And then if it doesn't shake out, we'll defer these to 119. Would that work for folks? Okay. It's okay. Alright. Good to see that Warren is donating his information. That is okay. Perfect. Thank you.
