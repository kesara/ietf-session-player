So firstly, I'll talk through some updates to the requirements, and I'll pass it on to Let me to foot finish up to note for the threat model, we didn't get... Much feedback on the threat model, so it has made remain basically the same since our last meeting, and we really on you know, feedback we got from requirements. So first of all, we clarified and updated the document consistent see. So made the introduction more generic can updated some of the sequence diagrams and center made it more readable. We also removed the requirement for a person the person only sharing. The last the last meeting we've got some feedback on that particular requirement because it is more on the credential author throw whoever is dealing with be redeeming the share for making sure that it's a one one thing of whatever information it shared rather than this transfer protocol. So figure agree to that and took it out. And and we've also removed the Van receiver trust of intermediary server. And moved into a security and privacy consideration section instead.

And lastly, we remove that single redemption requirement and again, moved into security privacy considerations. So But that I'll move... I'll pass it on to dimitri. Alright. To train. Feel free to step up to the to the queue, and I'll give you yeah. I was... I'll give him it another minute and if he able to start and I can go through these updates as well. Yeah. Don't So. Well, no. Here he comes. See. Okay. Go ahead. My story. Looks like I had problems with my headset I hope you can hear me now. Yes. We can. Awesome Thank you very much, Casey.

And basically the reason for that since we moved one to one agreement, So transfer from single device to another single device. We want to introduce limitation on the number of such transfers. And the second requirement is connection integrity and this is mostly covers the use case when we pass let's say, digital car, and the transfer process actually is an exchange between Center and the Device which includes key in the West and key request being exchanged between these two, we don't want it device. To intervene into the exchange and spoil the data. Basically, this is hold the. And I think I've covered most the changes to the requirements dock. Thank you, Casey. So I see, Eric is joining the queue. Yeah. Bear with me for a second while I find this button. We can just about it. There it is. I'll just start talking and then we'll wait for the button shop So I don't think I understand this first requirement and I'm not sure how you enforce it. Great I mean, I understand...

And and So is the point that the receiver would And so the, the receiver would then hand So in all for multiple devices, the receiver had to send that value to another receiver. Right? Yes. So the idea if you remember Eric, previously in the interim meeting we discussed that we wanted to remove the limitation of transferring from single device to another single device. Right? But we still wanted to introduce some kind of limitations because we cannot transfer to unlimited number of recipients. It's sure. But I but if he just goes to the layering of the system again, Right? I understand it is that the did the receiver device, then goes in talks to... I'm sorry, the provisioning partner, I guess. To retrieve the king material. Right? And so provisioning So the provisioning partner is in a position to limit the number of times number. But it's not clear how it's that could be how the anything and this system is in a position going with that number. I I have what would the so we have like we have the send of the receiver and I guess the relay. Any of them do to limit the number of pretty. Great. I think when needs as as I understood this requirement as is going in. The idea was not that the system would limit any the numbers and participants, but the sender could specify a limited it. Wanted the provisioning partner. To here too."

Is the sender guest to attach some stuff because I provisioning partner un modified Because maybe the other point to send over which to tell the partner. As well. I guess for And I just a assume it was gonna happen here. Is the center was... I mean, the sender was gonna send some stuff. Through whatever this magic which machine building is the receipt participant the receiver. The receiver would then send it that's the bridging partner, which do some things the system stuff back. Right? And so that's I was like, I assume that this got chance on a peak blob because send a bridging partner that can presumably include anything, including a number of devices. But it probably also includes like, you know, like, a time, like, a duration or, you know, whatever. Right? Maybe an action control list. So I guess, I just I don't Like I just... I just like I'm just trying to find up the layer here. Because it seems like this just seems like it's kind of a very concrete requirement. It more general like The system has to include some blob like can said the provisioning partner isn't isn't it? Am I just confused. Eric. I think the confusion is we are not trying to cover the provisioning part here it's it's the protocol. So we wanted to introduce some kind of limitation in the protocol Let's say we we we initiated it transfer and we wanted to say I'm sending. These are credential to one, two three users only like on a transfer level on a protocol level. Sure. My point is that's unfortunate to the provisioning partner or not by this protocol. Right? In case there is a provisioning partner. If there's not... I don't see this protocol forces that. As what. Well, Technically, it can be done in various ways. I'm just like,"

So the only thing that distinguishes like The thing receiver from one another is the secret majority you passed away. And we assume that the receivers are quad. Otherwise you wouldn't have a secret anyway. So I think like I think you need more I think guys... If you think, I guess Like, maybe this is a has requirement, but I guess trying understand what protocol machinery would do Think that probably like Yeah probably needs like some flesh out. And if you can't figure out if we can't design a critical machine redemption I'm not saying it that a final piece of protocol machinery rate, but the better at least one that we have in wine. Right? Okay. So I'll I'll go in the queue as an individual And Eric, isn't it possible is it this basically, what privacy post us I mean, they they they in very, you can limit the number of of times you can you can d reference a token essentially. Right? Well yes. So I think So certainly, what you could do So so certainly you could you could I think You can token something like privacy boards. Right? That's Like, I mean I mean it's like, I mean, You could certainly say like only only one round trip is available. Right to you. available. But have the same as saying, when devices is Right? Right. I mean, it it's a... Me give you a concrete example. The you know, the... You you you send to Let's say let's say you said first is that wants the that wants the So it means like, it's like,"

What's the receiver sent a message? Then you can't send another other camera. And that's like, yeah. Right? And receiver a state. And tries to re transmit and it's, like hosts. Right? And so like, my point is That's like That's over it's over. I'm they understand this requirement? Under cheating. Right? And so the the point the problem is trying distinguish between Multiple participants and multiple forge from the same participant not always obvious. Anyway, like yeah I think right probably after to this too long I guess what, I would suggest is, maybe someone could like, could like, write down like a paragraph two with a diagram, showing how long I do this. And then once we understand that, we'll know what this means. And if... That if you start over with that later then maybe is not good apartment. Like, I understand you had to be why the system had the property. I'm just trying to make sure that might be headset is later. Yeah. Your your comment is basically that, you know, we make sure that that the requirements are actually feasible. Yep. Exactly. Yep. Yep. Okay. And I think that this the second one, I think I think makes sense, this is just saying like you have you, like, then like a put in the center it. Putting in the end or in the and and in relay. and Yep. Yep. That's exactly not just spoil the data exchange. Yeah. Right. So I guess Yeah. Yes. That. That seems fine. I guess the the reason I'm sort of, like making some noise some funny noises here is because you know, you could design the system in a way that you have like end to end suppression of the of this data. But not trans level production, wouldn't me reschedule or something. You know, you might have And so interfere could actually be, like, denial service versus, like, versus like, tampering, right? And so, like, I just try to make sure like, you're... Your trying like to fine. Like, is this gonna this guaranteed delivery? Or just guaranteed non you know, non detectable interference. Right?"

So like I understand the version where this... Where the provisioning partner only allows one key to be issued. But how does the how would you envision this protocol specifying that that the two devices is participate. Right? So I by bite my assumption, the two devices are. And so how do you stop them from both participating and exchange? Try with requirement. Right? What why does it matter what the group world is because we are designing a transport. They cut one with my twenties my point. I understand that, what I'm saying is it the transport when you have two participants and they're c polluting, How do you stop them from screen to devices? They're not trying to prevent collusion. Right? This is similar to say Ip transport. Right? The job of ip transport is to that transport about it from one Ip this other. Right? But this is be specified the max of devices, been the commercial transfer. Correct. So in in case of Ip, the number is one. In this case, it could be. That's not true. And does that true? Why is it not true? Because you can have... Because if you have two adjacent devices, on true adjacent duration is the same network thing. What participate. As long as they cooperate. It sometimes even cooperate. So what they do after they receive the package is there but"

What we are trying to say here is that so I can use Maybe a simple example this is to me safeguard designing key are to share cookies between two people. Right? And if I put one cooking in there And I tell this other on the one person to pick it That's essentially what this requirement is. What the does with the Cookie after they retry. That's up to them Okay, That's not what this takes has. That is what it says, right the sender should be able to specify the max number of participant devices that That the transfer. I I mean, I... Okay. I mean, I step in there because I actually think you're the intention here is to talk about sort of about demonstrated control, but Eric is talking about collusion. Right? And and the the the text is a little bit bigger ambiguous and on... I I agree you guys seat now. I see when you mentioned them good. Yes. But the idea is not to control the collusion after the fact. It is just to the point packages unique individuals we should wanted it a little bit different. Yeah. I'll read do that. But I guess Actually wanna resist the example gave. So as I understood the design you just described. Be did he sender send the message drops christ off mailbox. You allow retrieval exactly once. Right? Mh. And now you have a two terminals problem. And so there's any kind of glitch on the receivers version receiver can't triggered. And and and the whole fails. So that here's doesn't even work. Why why would it fail on the... So what kind of so that the The relay forces, one retrieval, receiver asked for the message, the relay sends the message along, and deprecating the counter into. So okay. So can't trend again.

Sure What I'm challenging you to do is describe to being implementation of this requirement because I'm Skeptical crown could be achieved. I mean, as far as I understand we are supposed to come up the requirements and then the working group is supposed to design the solution. Right? Well yeah. Tell but a point... Yeah. Hang on. The point which is ...I mean, Eric does have a point there. That it it it doesn't make sense put requirements that we don't to have at least some idea that we could actually implement. Right? Now I made the point for you arrived. Okay. It it is possible to to design schemes like like this using things like... Well it's kind of similar to what privacy pulse does. Where you can limit the number of times you can der reference the token. We're consumer is token. You you they said typically build on digital cache schemes. So it is possible to do But the question is, is that the intent of the text Clearly, the text needs to be clarified to clearly describe being ten days maybe the intent is simply what you said, It's just about sort of setting a a a a counter on the packet, basically. Right? And it assumes that there's no collusion in place. In that... If that is the case, it should clearly this. I I agree that we need to clarify better.

Which is you have two options when you're designing system like this, regardless of what the implementation is. One option is that you really only want another device to be able to pick it up one other device be able to pick it up at most. And if you do that, then that other device when it fails, This transfer is done. They they have to go back and request another thing. They're not you're not giving them a second crack at it. And if you put in this requirement, what you're saying is we want the system to fail if the recipient device fails. That might be fine. But it's just worth thinking about, is that what we want? Is that does that trade off makes sense? It does. Yes. And in some cases, you may want some retry mechanism built in. And in some cases not, but that's definitely something we can consider. Dimitri? Go ahead. I just wanted say that we definitely need to clarify the requirement and we can do that over the mailing least. Yeah. Eric very nice offered to samsung. That's greatly appreciate today.
