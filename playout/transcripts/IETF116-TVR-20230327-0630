So I think we understand the agenda and the resources free Yokohama oklahoma And I want put the agenda up real quick and then pause for minute just see if we have any agenda bashing that we'd like to go through. We have a pretty packed agenda in the and the time that we have today in the hour and a half, we're gonna finish up with our comments in just a few minutes. We're gonna go into a series of presentations and the goal behind the series of these presentations is to start the discussion on the various kinds of schedule information where it might come from, what information needs be present and how one might use it based on some experiences in other domains. And then at the end of this, because this is the first time that our working group has met, will be asking for people to consider joining together to author internet drafts which will eventually become working group documents. Other than that, I am Ed Bur brain c chair. Tony Lee is online, other c chair. We have Adam, as our secretary. And Please go into the shared notepad.

    "text": "Alright. So The first item on the agenda is is me talking through a couple of questions around our our use case overview. When when we started the original birds of the Feather meeting in London. We wanted to put together a couple of use cases that talked through what we were trying to accomplish what we thought would be some of the benefits. Now we're now to the point where we have the working group started, but I think those use cases can still serve as a useful rubric for understanding the kind of work and the kind of solutions we're trying to put forward in this working group. So to that, end I wanted to very briefly in just a few minutes go over the three primary types of use cases that we had talked about last time. As a reminder. The first was to understand that if we have some information related to when links will and will not be around, then we could do better local resource management on certain kinds of devices and by managing resource around when we believe we will have connectivity that would allow for more optimal use of resources on our platforms which perhaps means that nodes would live longer in the network or be able to pass more data in the network or do more sensing in the network or other functions in the network because they are active for a longer period of time in the network. And that if there is that sense of schedule awareness, this idea of local resource preservation is a potential benefit. And that is a category of use cases. And they're many different versions of that, And as Tony had mentioned, we're not so interested in whether a spacecraft is red or whether a spacecraft is blue, we're just trying to understand sort of the the logical benefits."

    "startTime": "00:10:02",
    "text": "The second kind of use case that we had talked about was how how well we could adapt to external condition. Separate from local resource preservation if things such as our use of power or access to communication, an the example we had given in London was the case where we might get into data caps or sort of other high rate versus low rate usage of power or comm then paying attention to a schedule, could, for example, reduce the total cost of ownership of of running a a node or a series of nodes if we're looking at credits environmental credits, environmental impacts, green computing things of that nature, understanding when a high cost versus low cost activity could occur in scheduling around it. Is another kind of benefit and another kind of use case. And then finally... And and what is pretty clearly the major use case for for many people when we were talking to folks coming out of the was this idea of mobility and predicted mobility. And there were a couple of types of predicted mobility. Distance related att continuation, for example, I drove far enough away that I lost my link. Or external characteristics that we know we're going to take away our ability to communicate for a period of time, such as I drove into a tunnel that didn't have repeater in it. Or that I'm planning to change the top in some way that helps me perform my my functions. Like, I'm gonna point my antenna somewhere else for a certain period of time and all of those, in some way or another we categorized under the use case of mobility and mobility in the devices. The question that we have to the work the the first question that have to the working group is, having captured those use cases, and of course, there's refinements to those is their value in saying that an informational product of the working group should be a statement of These are the driving and non du use cases that we could use to help shape the work that we are doing."

So if I were to start a poll, right now that says, please raise your hand if you think that we should create a use case document as an informational product out of this working group and do not raise your hand if you think we should not, and that it's it's utility is over. K. And I see that Mark is in the queue. Not lost yet. I like use case informational documents. If they go clearly into the actual requirements and stuff. Sometimes we see the I don't know. One hundred pages of use case informational document that you know, go nowhere. So if it's you know, to the point and useful for you know, real word, then it's fine, but so I would have have said raise no depending on, you know, the outcome. So fair I noted and and to say that that if we did do an informational rc, it would still go through a working group last call and we would still make sure that it was a a concise and useful document. But there seems to be a pretty clear consensus here forty one versus one that at forty two that we should do that. Alright. With that, thing that I would ask is consider as you read this document, whether we feel that there used cases that are missed if so what is missing?"

And can you hear us? I hear can we hear you. Little. Yes. We can hear you loud and clear. Excellent. So how all my name is. I'm actually giving this brief on behalf of Brian Seat. He was unavailable tonight, but he's a colleague I could say, I could agree with the the the that's in in these sort of slots. This is to give a little bit of a background on what is the aero in information exchange. Temporal model. There is no actual It of draft today associated with this, but it's for to bring to light an existing time variant information model that exists in the community. So I kinda walk through and talk a little about what this is what it's not and and how we might apply it if we were to Dvr. Through this set here. So ed next slide or I don't know if I can afford. Great. So just a little background is to sort of what we're what we're trying to do here. So effectively this temporal morality model came about because in the or not industry, there was a need to convey time based schedule based information. They needed way a common language that allowed people to to convey that information so that everyone understands what was being conveyed what the bounds, all that information. So that is exactly the use of this model"

    "startTime": "00:16:03",
    "text": "It it provides for both absolute time and periodic time. And one thing that's very important to understand for this model it's completely abstract from the producers of the information to the users of the information. So what I mean there is this is strictly the information model for conveying the state of a system or a feature to assist a property system. It does not attempt to prescribe why that state changed or what calls that state to change So strictly a model to describe the states as a function of time. Some of the things to note that is the bottom. Right? It's kind of the inverse to what I just said and also, you know, this is is an information model for a different industry. It's not necessarily prescriptive to Tv, but something who think about because there was a lot of work that went into this and a lot of lessons learned. So Next slide. Alright. So just a little bit more background and also the link to this temporal model is the very bottom. So I highly encourage anyone to go read that Is actually very very well written. Is is a baseline, so ax is actually huge model, which could... Which because comprised of many different components you, you know, if you love And want go read about all the different components that are even applicable in their industry. It's out there. This temporal model is a separate piece. So it evolved from the need to simply convey that time variant information and they wrote it as a totally separate document and standardize it as part of ax them So It kinda speaks to the importance that they they saw it for this information model. It's a... Its original intent was to convey these notice to air mission. Information exchanges, no tam. These are things that effectively, you know,"

    "text": "either planned or something immediate has happening and the need to send out a notice to the community to, you know, make their locally community safe or just actually operation as as intended. Interesting thing to note is even though it hasn't been standardized, and maybe some of these other communities this concept has been used as a link planning tool for, you know, ships, cruise liners who are actually connecting to Geo. So I think that's some motivation kind of going back to the the the use cases had mentioned that this is actually applicable to this community. So move forward. So to kinda set the tone to what this is. And like I said, go read the the doctor it it describes it probably much better than I will. One component that this is conveying our features. So first off a feature could be something like in this picture of a runway. You could imagine the state of a runway change over time. Maybe it's only valid or allowed to be used between eight Am and ten Pm every day. And also properties of that runway might change, maybe the direction of the runway might change maybe the frequency with which you would talk to air traffic control. To use that runway Might change over time. You could imagine that these are plan, well in advance to to support all the users of that runway. So this is a model that allows you to express that information. Like I said, at the top a feature sort of describes all of the properties p one through p five in this picture of those time variant things that are changing. And and and it allows you to kinda specify what are the bounds on those properties. When does it start? When does it stop? And what's the eight on this. And next. Some definitions, these are pulled straight out of the Ac document."

    "startTime": "00:20:00",
    "text": "I won't go to deep here. The one thing, I guess to note is This model supports both permanent definitions of state over time as well as temporary state and I'll go into that on the next a little bit more. Go ahead. Alright. So here's a picture of kind of pulling it all together. Of the different sort of time inside this model. You can see you've actually got a baseline. So we need to define this this model sort from the beginning and they called it a baseline. You need to define all of the properties associated with the sure you design your start of life as well as your in life and you can see how this clear discrete boundaries between each of the state changes in this picture. You also have the ability to specify if I temporary value. So that's your temp delta. So maybe a an emergency happened or something failed and you want to express the ability that there is something temporary. It's not where your your long term model, but you have the ability to specify that. You can also update your actual baseline lines with what they call perm delta. One thing that's nice to note you look at the access model is the language describes conflict resolution if you will for this model. So it it it applies I think sequence numbers and basically, a another number that allows you to if you've got several of these stack together, you know what is the most current, what is the most accurate set of information and how to overly overlay these different slices to know what is the state at for specific top So go forward. So there are a couple of things Sorry. One four. Okay. So one very important piece of this model, which we think is actually quite useful to Tv is the ability to specify periodic behavior"

    "startTime": "00:22:00",
    "text": "in in your schedule. So you could imagine for for a vehicle that, you know, there's some Iot since driving by maybe every day or maybe every few hours try lose past a sensor it needs to close that link. You could specify that here one of the nice things of allowing for sort of periodic orientation of this information is it's compress It's easy you can convey without having to specify every single change forward in time. You can specify these these periods at different durations. I I think the one caveat is that they should not overlap. Right? It's very nice to kinda express that upfront. So move forward. So two things that this model doesn't capture, which might be very useful to Tv r if something like this would be to to be adopted number one, parameter inter relation, The idea here is an ax to model everything is very discreet. Those parameter values are discrete. But we could imagine a use case where latency. And a comes length changes as a function of time, or maybe the pointing vector of an antenna as its steering changes the function time. So looking for it, it might be useful to be able to express those parameters as a function of either time position or some other input parameter. Rather than as a discrete value. This was something that might be useful to add to a model like this. Support? Another concept not discussed in ax some is sort of a planning horizon. So axel simply describes how to express information and transmit that. In in this community, we might have a need to only look forward a little bit in time. So if I'm a device who's consuming this information, even though I've been expressed a model that you know, moves on for many days or weeks, my time horizon might be very short. So an ability to"

    "text": "differentiate that from the information which is being conveyed might be useful concept to alleviate to burden on those devices, they're are trying to consume this information. But this would be not necessarily a part of the data model. More a park of the, you know, going back to edge use case a a use case that allows you to use that information different for different users. Good. So bringing it all back like, what are some of the use cases here for Tv, Where you could very much imagine this concept of expressing parameters over time, very true for a router or a communication system? Whose link varies over time, you'd be able to specify when when those changes are occurring and what's the state of the system at those changes. Very useful because this gives the the systems which are consuming this information, it gives them the ability to decide how they consume the information. As the model is only useful for describing the information, it allows the system to actually use that however they need. And I think the the last bullet here curiosity, very important possibly for this meeting. So last slide. So the conclusion, And I and I would say the takeaway for myself from Brian, go read this model. Check out the concepts that are there. And perhaps if we are starting to describe a data model for Tv r, see if there is a way to utilize some of the way the information has been expressed in Ac. I think it's very could be a very useful concept, a nice language that we can use to discuss the terms of applying a data model or use cases in this picture. Take a look at it. Lots of lessons learned and Yeah. I would say use the the forms to see how it works."

You know, is this model freely available to be used or we have to deal with the faa and it will be an agency you know, to be able to grab pieces of this model. So this the the... I think on the second slide or slow is a link to the model. It's a standard published by the uncle information or the air industry. You're free to use it. There is no content in the model. It's simply a language to describes how would you convey this information And how would you specify the state as a function of time or curiosity? So there there's no real information that you would be. Using inside the model. So I would say it's free to to consume look at and leverage. Next. You mentioned some thing like, you know, following antenna as a function as opposed to I guess a table of value. So I was wondering Is is there a good, you know, worst case example? What what you seeing right now where Axiom doesn't do it well. With with the table and if so why doesn't it include functions? Because I think that as you mentioned might be very interesting for Tv and I wouldn't know how to decide whether would need functions or just you know, tab prep representation. Yeah I would say there is, I guess, it depends on how are there discrete steps in time? Or is the granularity so small that you would have, you know, a thousand over a period of say, a minute or a couple of or thousand different states. And if you've got to that granularity, expressing the function sounds way easier. But I'm sure the details seem to be worked out as how you would you know, know what is the state"

Ke my, you mentioned in the concept of processing horizon as in at what point would it no longer be beneficial to consider data beyond this. Does the ax model contain for signaling what might be a useful processing horizon like oh beyond this point, the data is more of a gas or is this not defined? They, I think it could be... If you look at the model, it it has both the sort of language to describe it as well as examples using U and and examples of how you would convey that information. So could you add this as a field? Yes? Now I think one of the the pieces though is potentially, this should not be part of the information model because each device might decide how they or to use that separately. So a configuration parameter of the device, not necessarily useful component of the information which you're gonna convey. Yes. But is there information that the device could use to make its own determination. Of what it might consider a useful processing horizon. Oh, I'm sure. Absolutely. Okay. I. Emery, thank you.

This all goes back to the the original motivation for for or networking which was extending internet into planetary space, and how how would you do that? And there are various constraints on deep station mission communications to the it didn't inform a lot of characteristics of contact graph. First of all, in deep space initial communications, no wires, of course, there's no cables on to a spacecraft is wireless either radio or or free space article. The distances are potentially very long. Between, you know, here in mom, for example between three and a half in twenty light minutes. So over these long distances, you get high signal over wireless transmission. So the data rates are reduced by instances. And And that also sort of preclude all the directional transmission because that that further reduces the data rates for if power that goes into the transmission of the signal. So links between communicating those are formed by direct transmission directed transmission between and can I that are pointing to directly each other? So maximize the received signal part.

The transmission reception rates are limited by aperture size, if large antennas on the ground small antennas on spacecraft. And available power. You have plenty power at a brown station that minimal power spacecraft. So the data rates to the spacecraft from the ground and from the spacecraft back to the ground are likely be very different there. They're highly ace asymmetric We also have a small number of ground stations on earth. Which is rotating so that we're not always going the same direction. And they're supporting multiple spacecraft which are in orbit, either over around the sun or written over around some other time third body. And spacecraft our usually, not always, but usually body fixed. So in order to antenna you have to point to spacecraft and that isn't always possible because the spacecraft has potentially instrument operations that demanded the the the spacecraft path would be ported in a particular direction that is inconvenient for the antenna at the same time.

Communication at Mars is similar to course, but it's actually more complex because it it was determined what a long time ago that the communication from Rover on the surface of Mars is... You can get a lot more data from that rover if the data from rover is relay to an orbiter instead of transmitted directly earth this is maybe counterintuitive, but But the reason for that is that the order can we... Because it doesn't have the land, can be much larger than the the road run surface.

So questions came up about policies regarding holding dropping forwarding bundles. As you may Well, no in one sentence. Description of bundle product all. It's a store forward, you know, system, right, or layer three system where you store bundles when you don't have connectivity or reachable to the destination until you know, reachable come back, for example, when you have a link then you forward it goes over the network. So it's really a stored So I looked at different Bp bundle type implementations that are roughly available as open source variable support to policies regarding what you do when you old or your drop or you forward bundles, including a lot of to be to be done.

So I'm using packet but think about bundle at the same thing. Next slide. So forwarding behavior, if the this is unreachable, the packet is not started and therefore, saved in memory. That's the basis of bundled protocol. Whether it's for vol or non volatile is an implementation The package should be saved with the same stamp. To be used by policies described later? When a new route is installed or in general when the forwarding table is change for whatever reasons, then the safe packets our parts you know, call parts, and those that can be sent our scent in order reference policy discussed. Next slide? So therefore policies are needed. For following evidence. Packet memory store is full. Or bundle. And then new packet is coming. What do you do? You accept that packet. Do you drop some packets to have space for that packet. For bundle. This destination becomes reachable by a new route entry tree in the farting table. Which start packets do you forward first?

The capability of storing packets for forwarding node maybe resource demanding especially in scenarios where resource are very limited such as space. Therefore, the forwarding node owner may want to have preference on which Types of packets are stored or not. For example, I may say that I have a policy that store packets based on the source address or destination address or the bundle world, you know, node ids and endpoint Ids or various fields such as label on the servers or else. Right? And bottles at the same similar kind of fields. So that this can be used for you know, defining policies for forwarding or dropping packets. When packets needs to be dropped, and error should be sent to the source, both Ip and Bp as those error messages However, in the constraint environment, error messages may be too costly to send back to the source. Or another case it's just that The packet or the bundle is just too old, there is no need to and an error message back because it's you're completely irrelevant they are. So you know, think about space where, you know, it maybe and our day before it actually come back. Or a reach or something. So there should be a policy to tell the node what to do.

Thank you for that. I you look a proper review of the list I know. One piece of advice having implemented similar things in the mane world the ability to split the metrics away from the individual links. Is useful. You the ability to say, here are some sets of metrics that are common across multiple of the. It just... It makes the model a bit more manageable and my second point would be being able to have dynamic sets of metrics because for some operations I'm again in Tv, we're trying to be fairly generic here. Some operations bandwidth are relevant, but some metric we can't think of right now may vital for that deployment? So being able to maintain some flexibility in what an individual metric is, that have a common treatment for that metric within the model, I think is already why to do.

They will controller or. So this is more focus on on the these situations of preserving resources and and so or even a schedule maintenance changes that's all. So we can expect that they they will be. So how from these, these network controllers. So because of that because there is some plan for these changes So the impact of these changes can be so how calculated beforehand. So maybe we can consider that there could be algorithms embedded in an our controller that could calculate what would be the impact of the the changes that that are foresee. Or maybe we could even consider a experimental ways of retrieving the the expected new situation, maybe playing with twins, something like that. So there will be a the end means of understanding what would be the impact. So then because we will just be able to have the both views there the the person due on the future view.
