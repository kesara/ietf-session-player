I did know, but I had forgotten Al has a twin brother who I never met. that would have been really fun to come to BMW GNC 2 Al sitting up front. I think that would have been fantastic. he had a big family. He had a long career in standards. So as a product manager, one of the things that I always do is look at your speeds and feeds or your data sheet so to speak. And so if I were to put that in the context of what Al did from a standards work Al published his first RFC in 2002. Oh my gosh. That was before I was even here at the IETF. He published his last one in May of 2022, so a 20 year span of RFCs for which he published 42 and he had 56 expired drafts. So he contributed a lot to BMWG.

So a little bit of history first. Benchmarking methodology working group was formed in October of 89, It came out of some work I had been doing at Harvard, and I'd set up a test lab to test the performance of switches and routers and bridges and things like that. That was the IETF chair heard about that and asked me to form working group which I did So it was chartered October 1 1989. I was chair for a few years, but then I joined the ISG, and they're not supposed to be a working group chair when you're on the ISG. So I turned it turned it over.

Next slide, please. So, Bracko, before we move, I I did have some feedback there. two things. BMW G often step rates the methodology from the terminology. And even on list, I saw you struggling with trying to keep the terminology smaller so that the document's readable. but 2 things. I'll go back through when you have the updated draft and read it again. to see, hey. Should you pull it And the reason I'm saying that and and create a separate terminology draft, the reason I'm saying that is for better or for worse, when I do a review on op for IASG when the documents are going through the the process for RFC. I'm a big fan of having readable drafts And honestly, I find it really super annoying if I have to go pull 10 different RFC to full to find the definition of a term if you just put it here, it would have made reading through this RFC so much easier And My recollection from reading your previous draft was that that was true here that having the terminology you had, I found made reading your draft really approachable and easy to consume. So I'm happy to go through and read again. when you have your updates from the renames that you were talking about. but you should I'm proposing that you consider potentially keeping your terminology separating it into a separate document if you're finding it too big.

So, basically, you see are speaking of 1 of the 2 flavors of segment rooting. The idea is that we'd like to exploit the capability of SR Meaning that sort of leverages the source routing paradigm, so you basically instruct, it know that the addend node, with a policy to take action and let's say steer the packet. At the advantage of signal routing is that You do it on the head end. So the the state is mandate only on the 1st route of the chain. The other is simply can steer the packet according to the policy. The policy basically is a is a set of segment identifiers or SIED. And that's say, the key 4 packet steering. Now that's the general behavior. Then for semi rooting, we have 2 flavors to data place where we can instant shade that behavior so One is signal routing over MPS, which is the subject of this draft. And the other one is segment routing over ipv6, which is subject of the next class that will be presented by 1 of of the other coders. What's the problem here that we don't have any the benchmarking for SRMPLS. We have the benchmark capability for MPLS which is, let's say, addressed in RFC 5690 5. but as well. So we need to go further and let's say, elaborate the full set of mechanism for having the benchmarking of the segment routing capabilities of a a network device."

So we need the standard MPLS mechanism to implement a signal routing. So, basically, we use the the the the standard way, which is we do reuse the the labels currently adopted in my place. So assignment identifier, SID, basically enabled. Since the behavior is sort of one to one correspondence between MPLS, the operations supported by MPLS end those enabled by SR MPLS. So there are 3 of them. If you are familiar with MPS, you know that there are label push, meaning We put a label on top of the packet this label pop. So we remove the label. And this work, which is we basically tweak the the the labels, and there is a change of the forwarding mechanism. for we have exactly same 3 operation push, which is exactly as the name implies label push. There's a next or label pop. and continue level swapping. Now how to implement the benchmarking for SR MPLS. clearly, we have to rely on RFC 5695 again, the benchmarking of basic, let's say, MPLS Capital Network device, and do something on top of that. In the draft, we propose some extensions to the base capabilities,"

So, for example, Test, a label stack, so a seed stack, which is longer than one single label. and that is recommended, let's say, to be prepared for dealing with traffic Engineering. Dender is a different reporting format, clearly, that is a consequence of the diff differences or extensions we are introducing the benchmarking. and then since we are dealing with the dynamic distribution of the SAID, we have also to consider, for example, a way to do that. So for example, having e. protocol in the control plane able to support the SAD distribution. And clearly, As you see, we need to repeat the test for every single operation and see what's the the result. So that's for the introduction of ASR and PLS.

So terminability is is somehow being demonstrated now. surprise. will be now the time of start doing test for more more related to the benchmarking. in order to compare the solutions. Mhmm. So just to amend fact that probably the industry now has been just simply focused on interoperability now will be the time we'll start looking at this and and maybe something that we can and I couldn't say commit, but try to to have something really for the next IETF or into ITFs. some some results apply in this this document for so validating the debit benchmark being described here. Yeah. You again, BMW G is a fan of results so please. That would be very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions before we move on? Perfect. sorry? Just one more. Nate name? Oh,"

We spent a ton of time, actually, maybe too much time in in ensuring that things are reproducible and that they can serve as a basis for real hard testing. not calling it certification. But but, really, for for benchmarking, where the results are reproduced if you take the RC, and you put it through the test, Then you gain get results, and the results are reproducible and understandable. Mhmm. And I'm not sure looking at this document because also you said, it's mostly for interoperability. that is the goal of this document. So is it really the goal the authors to create a benchmarking document. I'm not saying to judge it in any way. I I just want to understand because if so, then they need to provide much harsher harder comments then if it's just really just to get people familiar with the with the common problems of, say, SR testing and so on. Karsten, let let me try to answer. I'm sure that it's for benchmarking. I'm sure about this. But I am it I'm asking you to read yourself Please read yourself and tell tell is it about interoperability or is it about performance? Please read yourself. I did What? He Carson is saying he did. So Look. I'd say, I think this is a fantastic conversation to continue on list. I will say as chair, we are the benchmarking methodology working group the interoperability working group. So for sure, it needs to be focused on benchmarking, and I didn't see that it adhered far from that. So, you know, I continue to reiterate.

And and I know you mentioned a couple the angle of the satellite, the azimuth, for example, But weather conditions, might be another sandstorms in the desert, fire, smoke, and smog in the air from the fires that seem to be going on everywhere. do those things.

I cannot name it because unpublished But in actually, it's easier than one might think. because they were specialized emulators, of course, getting real trends the capacity is quite expensive. especially if you want to do our performance tests. So that's often out of question. I would be interested to see if the the lab network from China Mobile. The the satellite network from China Mobile and to the com whatever you said is is would would have this capacity capability. But generally speaking, there are professional, like, satellite emulators that shed emulate the transponder capability. And in the end, traditional satellites are very straightforward devices, they basically bid it's relay things. You know? You they don't do anything. except just taking the data and forwarding it. But I'm not sure if Starlink or Copa or Telesat are operating the same way. So that will be one They they are mostly like they have a mesh, and they all are layer 3 aware or at least layer 2 aware. I believe. I'm not sure. So we would need to figure out. Do we need to have satellite vendor specific methodology or can we have a general methodology? that's one of the questions I have. The other one is the focus of the draft that you're aiming for. Is it more about forwarding performance, like, throughput, throughput, or throughputs at scale, like, single user or overall across all users. or is it more about routing scalability and resiliency? because that that's actually an area where the IETF is doing a lot of work in satellite ready routing topologies.
