I'm leaving directly from here to the airport. but this is a fun way to cap off. Lovely IETF week. So next slide, please. And, Jonathan, you might as well as get in the queue, like, preemptively since he sent a nice mail this morning, which is filled with good thoughts that we're all gonna talk about. But Just for those of you in this room, we're not familiar with what we're doing with this. Here's the idea. Basically, when we specified STIRR and JACON initially, It was really focused on, like, how you set up a call. This is trying to beat things like robocalling, spoofing, things like that. where you thought it would be handy. there was actually a way to address some further use cases that what runs through initial scope that had to do with responses. and, you know, doing connected identity, as we call it, figuring out who the party is, you actually reached when you place a call and getting some kind of security indication from them in the backwards direction, the classic problem. fact, it's so classic that even back when we did that ill fated document called RFC 447 for. Colin and I worked on ever so long ago now, a guy by the name of John Illwell came up with a whole complex connected identity system how you'd be able to figure out, like, who is on the other side and substitute, like, you know, all the necessary parts of the dialogue syntax of SIP to make that work, But we need this for sure, and there's a reason why it's because there are a set of interesting tax. These are largely fraud attacks. You see these largely in mobile networks. around things like that project, route hijacking, where it's like, I'm trying to call my bank, and someone has somehow managed to make sure that this gets routed instead to an attacker. wouldn't it be great if you had an indication for your bank of who they were? Call stretching and similar attacks. These are cases again, in mobile networks that are unfortunately endemic where people try to make it look like the calls a little bit longer to one end than the other, and then they kinda pocket the distance"

We do we're just able to authenticate even where the body came from. that would be great. for fixing things like that. And, also, this little thing we did called SIP Brandi, which is looking at a way to get a full security stat Stack for SIP needs this. There's a bunch of things that are motivating this. It did take us beyond our initial threat model, initial charter, but we fixed that. So that's what we're talking about. Next slide. you know, the way that LL did this required a lot of pracs and acts and complicated things. And, ultimately, I think we decided in this group, it would be unlikely to be deployed if we just updated that. for RFC 8224. So instead, we can have this new notion. Let's have a new passport type. It's called RSP, And let's just assume that in the majority of the use cases that we're interested in, The routing of a request and responses is is fairly symmetrical. It's likely to go through the same species residing at the edges of networks. So, like, why don't we just say, hey. you can just put in provisional responses, even in final responses and certainly in any mid dialogue or dialogue altering requests, like, something that, you know, an identity header and that identity header may have different semantics, semantics, it's in a response, And for that case, we had to find a new passport type, which is called RSP. And RSP basically can only be used for these responses. And Yeah. We think that this is a much simpler solution. I'm not gonna go into all the details of that solution today, but feel free to read the track. That's basically the direction this has taken. I'm now thinking this is fairly mature and probably pretty close to being ready to ship, But I understand there are some questions. about it. So next slide. I think"

No. Of course not. So there's an interesting use case that we often place phone calls for verifying someone's numbers. If you sign up at a website and you put in your phone numbers, your identity, system will text you or you have the option to call you, and this is, like, widely used we all know as a form of QFA. There's been complaints by lots of security folks that just I'm sure, echo over here that, you know, there's various attacks possible in the network for diverting phone calls and sim stealing and whatever that introduced a possibility that Those are actually not"

Of course, that'll require that messaging infrastructure be implemented, and that'll that'll take a bit, but, you know, the levers are starting spruce are starting to be turned on that. Okay. So then if if we all concur this a useful use case. my ask would be one. Just maybe a paragraph of text in the intro. quoting this use case. It does have some implications on the spec. which leads to one of my comments, which was that the draft currently requires that unless I misunderstood. That's why this question that the receiver of the call pass backwards the RSP, but it sends the RSP passport, but also Only when the desk is there must be a diff passport forever in there as well. been changed. Only one of this has been changed. From that forward. Okay. So I read this paragraph that had this requirement in it twice, And to me, it was ambiguous that that's actually the case. And I can I can quote the text why that is. It's 2 sentences. and the second one that introduces the requirement does not say not have div in it. Does not actually say, like, that only it just makes the blanket statement that that that it's it has to be there in the response. So Okay. So only if there were divs in there must they be sent backwards. Okay. If you're just If you clarify that, I think that helps because the case I'm most interested in is, like, No one in the middle even heard of the div thing."

I'm very concerned about accepting it. right, if a diversion happened, but there were no devs in it. and I'm sure you can see why. Yeah. Yeah.

Like, don't know who who the hell got this thing.

And I don't think anything the document tells you, you are obligated to trust anyone. Right? because we we don't tend to say that in the idea. Hello? Just to respond to Jonathan's use case a little bit. Like, As a person who lives outside the US and is constantly forced to impersonate that I have a US billing credit card with a US billing address so that I can get any service I want. I am very glad that I can forward my SMS and my voice mail from a US number 2 outside of the US So I think you'd have a set of users with a mixed set of requirements in this. I totally get the point you're making. But if I chose to forward my phone number to something else where I could receive it, there might be you know, I might wanna receive what went to it and and still have it sort of look much like I could still authenticate from that phone number. Whatever. Okay. I mean so definitely what what I would take away from this, and I think what the minute should take away. I'm certainly happy to document this particular, you know, TFA use case both for voice and probably with an illusion to messaging. And I I think we can find a place to emphasize in the text that the IETF does not tell you who to trust or why. Yeah. Chris? Chris went I'm I'm just wondering, do we we talking about validating the called number or the forwarded to number we clear about that? are So for for the TFA case, you're effectively you were you were validating the called number.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm just making sure we're clear about that. this gets ambiguous too because, I mean, some of these these baiting callback attacks Right? You really are marking mostly just making sure that that service that is doing the callback you know, when it connects, it's getting the a right assurance that the number it tried to reach is the number that, in fact, you're connected to to punch in the code or whatever. Personally, I think the security of it should be sufficient for most applications, and it does help people, like, in current situation, but I also think we can be very agnostic and say, don't wanna trust with these. They have any divs in it. Don't trust it. So noting just, like, to to to sharpen the point you're sorry. Erica's goal of sharpening the point you're just making the the security of the system for telephony. Let's just deal with telephony for a second. I'm sorry for, like, you know, phone calls depends on the The validating authority the validating entity reaching believing they have reached the person they're trying to reach on the other end. Right? So you obviously need a chain of, like, of, like, approval while we're done on the line. One thing I guess, I don't know enough about the messaging case. Like, I don't know how messaging really works. But, like, is there, in fact, in like SMS some sort of like know, as there is with with with voice, is there actually some, like, confirmation of the person you're reaching, or is this kinda going to the like, you don't get to hear back. Oh, I mean, today, it totally goes in ether. You have no idea. Right. Right. So so I think so I think that, like, So I think that, like, it's not I think that trying to fight this insurance for asking us is gonna be very difficult. even if in telephony, even if in phone calls, it works. Right? And because So the way the way we we expect that would probably be out of hand. other words, CPS is where we start for the SMS in particular. Yeah.

Like, that just struck me as a This is fundamentally an asymmetric protocol and imposing symmetric requirements didn't make sense to me. Yeah. So I would put it as a should, not a must. I'd be comfortable relaxing that. I mean, original you know, earlier versions of this have, like, option tags and supporting acquired and everything so you can kind of negotiate support for this.

This is useful only under the condition where you have a authentication service that can that supports RSP, But is only sometimes putting it in, And it will only put it in if asked. Now if that's true, then you need signaling. If we believe what's gonna happen is if if an authentication service supports this, they'll always put it in no matter what, then you don't need anything.

So require you know, what are you gonna do? that's required, are you gonna hang up the call or, you know, I can tell you this in our implementation, this would be a global switch in our manager. You just turn on, like, RSP for everything. Right? and, like, that that's just how you do it. So I don't know, Pierce. So Well, you know, send send a mail if you wanna make a a bigger case for this. I think probably the tools we have exist and it would just be like a hassle to to either do the SUSIP negotiation and for the passport itself, I mean, remember too, is a case where, like, the passport is being consumed by the verification service, right, on the terminating end.

Why does this raise freshness issues? Well, because those things can be kinda dynamic. And at any given moment, whether a certain telephone number is under the purview of a given carrier who had been issued a shake insert, something we gotta solve for. And it's not just number portability. It's acquisitions.

There's a bunch of diff different potential approaches. They all have almost entirely identical properties if you, you know, squint at them right, and this is where it's always very hard for us to make a decision. about what to proceed and go forward with. way back when we did RFCAD 226, we defined a way that you could instead of having a telephone number list actually baked into the CERT itself instead have a URL. in the AI field that you can point to where you can go download the list of, like, all the numbers that this, you know, certificate currently has authority for.

Right? And like that, takes care of a lot of the concerns about your have to reveal all the numbers associated with it instead just on a 1 c 2 c basis. As a relying party, I received a call. I'm trying to verify it. is this number in scope. Now there are also ways to do that. where you don't have to do a dev. where instead we could staple and stapling. It's very common in web applications using TLS and so on. we defined in this draft Peterson STIR OCSP staple, and you staple element of the passport, that effectively contains what that OCSP you know, response would have been so that you pay the cost for acquiring that on the sending side, the calling side, the authentication server side, rather than requiring the verification server to do an RTK. right, at the end of that. that's an optimization on this. then there's a completely radically different entirely different way of doing this. But which is Why bother? like, you know, having these long lived certs that you then have to do all this OCSP stuff for and CRLs and whatever else. when we could just issue short lived certs. This shirt this shirt only attests say a particular telephone number it maybe only exists for an hour, maybe it only exists for the scope of this call. This sir will only live for a minute. and I get it dynamically generated. like, at the authentication service, at the time of putting this forward. you know, that property, it actually works a lot at the end of the day if you squint your eyes like o CSP with stapling. because, basically, what you do is you go to your certificate authority.

Now we're not literally gonna staple, we're gonna do is send the cert. as a literal in the X Five C in the Jot header of the passport. This makes the passport big. Right? We'll put the whole searching in it But, I mean, effectively, what we're trying to avoid here is again incurring that RTT on the verification service side. instead, we'll spend that RTT on the AS side to, like, you know, get this short lived cert since I've already got it, why not just stick it in the passport and ship that? So these are the 50,000 options. that we have and we've got a bunch of documents that are to find this stuff. Next slide, please. Eric, oh, if you wanna intervene on that, Was that crazy? The the last one? I guess I don't understand quite the difference in the last 2. And so maybe you could, like, try to flush that a little more. So, I mean, shortly without stapling would be I just send an x5u. And so the verification service, the relying party, actually has to go do the oral fetch. to get the the short lived syrup. That's the way shaken streaking ordinarily works. We don't ship the serve. typically, you know, in the past quarter and the SIP request or anything else. we just make the the terminating side go do a URL tab. So we're saying, let's short circuit that. and just as a DER encoded, base 64, literal, put the cert or its entire cert chain, right, literally into the header of the passport. That's what the last option is. I see. But you know that that's not what you do with, like, the current the current situation. It's not.

And for large call centers, they're placing a ton of calls. Right? We just wanna staple you know, I'm pulling 10,000 calls from this number out in the next know, so, like, can that because you only pay that cost once on the AES side. all the diverse places that the calls terminate in the BS side won't have to do that RTTA.

Ben jumping the queue here real quick to respond to that. I'm pretty sure at least in the general service provider approach this. You do not fail calls because of stair failures.

Anyway, what I was gonna get to is that might be part of our design might be one of the things we wanna think about is that outcome.

Like, they called me once 3 years ago, you know, whatever. Sure. works in that case. But it does not at all deal very well with the case of I'm routinely getting a phone call from someone. And this time, it was man in the middle. And I'd sort of like to know that. right, which is also up common at the case we're trying to do in some store. fairly judgment in that case. And you just have to make your own especially if you're used to getting the assurance from them, and this is something, again, we encourage people to build into UX. of all of us.

We'll ask more the agent should ask more questions. Yeah. If it did, maybe they ask less questions. So there are cases like that where there's a lot of stuff that can happen based on it we consider those cases. Secondly, I wanna come back to what what Ecker was saying. which is that I feel like we're sort of treating this like an OCSP problem. or a certificate problem, but it's nothing to do with that at all. The reality is is that we're we're talking about phone number list. And those phone number lists could be in the certificate, but they're mostly not in the certificate."

The reality is they're a pointer to something is outside the certificate, not verified by the certificate, has nothing to do with the certificate, and might not, although I know it is in your case, might not even be provided by the CA. So I wonder if what we're talking about here is, in essence, a protocol that allows the even AS, to interrogate, hey. I've been told that this is the this URL here or whatever. This is a list of phone numbers. you know, I wonder if this phone number I just got is in that list. and that has that we've only mistaken that as an OCSP problem because there could be a case where it's in the cert -- Yeah. -- but it's mostly not gonna be in the cert. So should we just and and Ecker was starting to sketch out protocols by which you can push information that allows you to make a verified or not check without even leaking information. There's all kinds of interesting stuff with it. So why why am I obsessed with couple of new things. Let me explain this couple of those things. Okay. Yes, please. Yeah. Well, it it for one simple reason. It's that I wanna make sure that the scope of authority that so remember, there's a whole, like, enshaken, a whole ecosystem. by which you go to someone to prove you're the carrier that you say you are, and that results in your ability to get a cert. I want a linkability between that check that make sure your AT and T and the set of number ranges associated with AT And T. There are any number of third party oracles will tell you, this is what I think the set of numbers associated with agencies. Okay. But my Even for, let's say, let's say, new star case, it would not surprise me if the piece of software that runs OCSP is not the same piece of software that will have access to the database. of numbers that you wanna verify is this number in as part of this list of users. Like, even within the same It's a different micro service that Well, I mean, it could be just a these are these are am I putting this? These are different things. And even if they're often run by the same provider, that doesn't mean you should couple them at the call level, which if you use OCSP, you are. So I'm sort of advocating for, like, none of the above as something at least worth exploring."

So and I gave this example to you before the meeting started. you know, NuStar owns some telephone numbers. that it's had for 20 years. that are under 571434. Good Northern Virginia numbers. Right? I can make a serve that bakes those because those dollars just don't change. that it would appear by value in the search. Right? And what is the process that we imagine the CA goes through to ascertain. that that happens, What all of this is trying to preserve? is that. It's precisely that whatever the process is in Sheakin or more broadly, you know, Push Sheakin infrastructure we're imagining for telephone numbers that the vetting aid that are determining that, you know, this telephone number age belongs to the person to whom the cert is issued. right, that, like, that that binding is what is exposed to relying parties. and you know, again, what I'm I'm very hesitant to look at this as a decoupledable problem. we're like, there's a cert. got a service provider code in it or it's got, like, a URL in it or something.

There's a huge threat surface. what that would look like. And so I I just wanna make sure we don't discard that properties, we start looking at alternatives to this. because all these things fall out that fundamental fact that you know, you could just bake the numbers into the cert itself. because the CIA did whatever vetting the CIA is supposed to do to determine, okay, a new star. has these, like, 57143 434 numbers, and it's just a couple thousand blocks.

Just wanted to check on a couple of points. Tesslie, you've been talking about certificates with TNF lists and all the OCSP work. Presumably, that does only apply to delegate certificates all of this. We're not talking about anything that would affect service provider level certificates. Probably not. Yeah. And secondly, simply on the RCD front. I assume, therefore, this only affects RCD certificate. and not all those passports rather and not also be embedded in shake and ports. You're a little quiet.

Some of you may have heard, there's been some chatter about implementing message layer security, which also has a brand making new RC number. into RCS. into a system that the GSMA and Google and several other people have been pushing for some time. kind of unified communications in the mobile network. and the integration of MLS into RCS raises some questions. basically what we said in the STIRR messaging draft is you know, if you're setting up sessions with, like, MSRP over TLS, which I guess was common in some of the earlier RCS specifications. Here's how that would work. I'm interested down what the interplay is between MLS. specifically. and setting up sessions where STERR would serve as a credential. And then when you start looking at this chocolate and Peter burger question of how you kind of get stirrer to work together with MLS. There are a couple of moving pieces I think we'd wanna decide between I'm not sure how much. 8225, would be in this versus just pure 8226. in the in the sense of you're gonna have a STIRR certificate and that stir certificate is somehow going to be related to the credentialing systems that have been built into MLS. if any of you caught Richard Barnes has talked at the beginning of the MLS session yesterday, they're looking at potential ways that multiple credentials can kind of be plugged into MLS. because MLS like TLS itself. It's not really you know, it's it's it's a it's a layer below the app"

I think we all acknowledge, though, that a lot of messaging happens to the world today is telephone number based identifiers. as a consequence, it would be great could figure out the right hooks to get, you know, the existing stir credentials that have gone out all these carriers who went to all this trouble to build these, like, massive KIs that are testing who these carriers are and what they have authority for. and to have those be able to plug into the credentialing systems above mls. My understanding is just kind of a way to pulling up to a credential from within ML and say, this is like a credential that I'm associated with. with the public king material I'm sharing in order to be able to participate in a room and so on. And, of course, we also have a way within SIP itself that goes back to SIP brande, RFC, 88 60. I can't remember what SIP brand is now, but through the m key parameter, to be able to have, like, a hash of the public king material that's being used for like voice encryption for things like DTS SRTP, and build that into a passport itself. So if we did want some passport integration, with that. that would be a way to do it. But, ultimately, what we may be talking about more than anything else is just having stircerts service credentials, for, you know, attesting in MLS this is an identity, I should be able to claim. maybe one of several. that, like, you know, kind of people can choose from in determining whether or not to trust me. maybe there needs to be some further glue that's like And if you're using open ID credentials or some similar thing down at that layer, is there some way to get the shaken certificate to light sign, that Wesett, WESett, WESett, WESett, WESett,"

And that a problem I think we'd need to solve. And I talked to Richard Barnes about this, and Richard has generously agreed to do some initial work on this with me to see if we can, like, flow the draft here see what that would look like.

The more of a input as you build the draft -- Yes. -- to not overlooked the hardest part of this problem, which has nothing to do with cryptography. and it's the organizational relationships of the entities that would end up using this thing.

And then we have the entity that that Today owns a certificate, which is a carrier for the phone number. And -- An SP is Yeah. Right. Exactly. And the relationship between the first two and that and that third is like, today sort of non existent, if not antagonistic. So that's the hard part to solve is how do you get How do you convince someone the sorry. How do you convince the service providers to let someone else take advantage of these certificates and hand them out to consumers in which is eventually, in the most context, that's how it has to go.

So let me let me say one thing about that, which is you know, when I was talking to Chris about this over lunch just the other day, I think there's one further piece of work that we need to do in acne. related to all this. And it's something that I floated at the drop about this years and years ago, which is basically using Acme to create a token for proof of possession for alpha numbers. that does, especially, kind of, Gladys like push. Yeah. But it's abstracted out from the rest of the glados. Right? then, I have a a draft about this. And, actually, I even warned Deb, that I had, like, one more thing I wanna do there. And it's that just for this purpose. So you're gonna end up getting an authority token generated that says this proof of possession you know, had been conducted, and it and this person has this telephone number, we could then plug both into flatos, and into this. But that is that is a separable piece of work. If you'd like to work on that with us as well, please jump on board and I mean, this is what I had in mind is, like, the next phase of Gladys is once you've you've externalized the mobile number verification to this independent party. like, it can directly issue certificates for those phone numbers that that demonstrate to consumers and therefore bootstrap the identity for This is certainly one of the things I had in mind when I wrote the draft. My point is let let's me. let's table that out of MeMe and everything else and let's do that as a pure acne like, this is what the service looks like.

So, like, they're I think they're There there are gonna be ways to do that, but the key thing about the MLS interaction in particular is that you can't have of credentialing systems and really to then becomes a question of know, when you're connected to a particular room, you know, if somebody trusts any one of them, they can get your identity through that.

As long as you have one overlapping trust anchor. You correct me if I'm wrong here, Sean. Like, if you have one overlapping, like, trust anchor with someone, then you can trust them on that.

So I I think that we should, you know, sort of work on this case. The other direction that could possibly happen is you can imagine the mobile OS vendors if they we're willing to work with carriers directly get the certs into the OSs and then have a way not to give the search directly to the applications, but allow the applications to access it in some rational way. I think that'd be another path. I think we should probably sort of sketch out a few of the different directions we might be able to do this and then pursue them all simultaneously.

So you'd have to authenticate that by signing the Diffie Helmet public with your passport. the or into the passport or with the cert. with the CERT probably rather than into the passport, as far as I'm currently understanding it.

All those pieces coming that's one way you can get a verified or or that's one way you can get a test station on The other way you can get on this is really designed for corporate identity is you go to CAA, the the the the identity providers, we're working with a bunch of them some are about to go into live production so that you can use your o off your single sign corporate single sign on style stuff. However you think that works in a flavors up it. you can use that corporate identity to get an assertion. That way, you get the same verified credential. And then we keep moving we get several ways to get those types of verified credentials with with different stations to them possibly even multiple ways.
