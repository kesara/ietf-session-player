    "text": "this draft I think what we're what we're providing is a little bit more flexibility that the pref that the customer prefixes they do not need to use safy for I think is that I believe that was your question yes yes I would recommend not using Safi 4 for carrying service routes okay uh that was my comment basically if you are saying that there are any cases where safi4 can carry service rout so my questions were related to that okay very good very good thank you thank you paj thank you yeah basically when you do that I think I don't think you can do option C because safi4 will be used as a transport family in some of the domains and some new domains if you're using it as service family then you'll be mixing these these two I see I see but if you're go ahead go ahead so I don't understand if you're not using Safi 4 for carrying service routs then how do you signal the labels explicit null implicit null Etc and and that is that is for for for the inas option C so so ker you're saying that I think you WR be required to and that that's a really good point that you make but if let's say for inas options that you would have to use um safy for for um if you're doing inas option Fe that would apply so and I I agree with that but if you're but let's say if you're to intra domain then the these service routes could be unlabeled you you agree with that so the service routes uh need to carry explicit null only for handling some specific cases where the penultimate hop is not able to do the forwarding properly and only in this case we need the label but it's we need to have a uniform way that works for all cases it's not like if one of the penultimate hops is not supporting it"
