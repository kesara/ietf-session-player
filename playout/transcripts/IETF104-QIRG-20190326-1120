    "text": "then eventually you get to the Gateway then the gateways job node I and this figure is to take that information and plan this connection those entanglement swapping operations and the purification operations we talked about yesterday how often are we going to do those things how many rounds of purification how long you\u0027re willing to wait for all these things everything you have to do in order to build a connection across multiple hops I is going to decide what everybody\u0027s responsibility is for this particular connection so question yes calif right question Giovani aside en so this is like a virtual circuit there to try to establish yeah pretty much right yeah this is the the actually that\u0027s a good point I didn\u0027t say that and I meant to say at the beginning this because as I discussed yesterday in the tutorial this at this level these first generation networks building this entanglement end-to-end is a distributed computation this is not stored and forward stuff all of these knows s abcdefgh i all of these nodes are going to be involved in building this entanglement and so they\u0027re all going to be cooperating there is going to have to be state at those notes yeah some of the earlier work we did we sort of sort of fudged at the edges and some simulation work that we did earlier and we did it without what you would consider really to be connection level state in this but the reality everywhere as as we get more and more detailed in the design we\u0027re finding that it\u0027s really going to require state for those connections at the nodes yes hi this is Alan I\u0027m still confused between a Mb there is a quantum link right yes but then I\u0027m assuming that the results are classical ding right yes how ok so this is a network a quantum network topology which overlaps a classical network topology well this the diagram represents the quantum in the quantum topology and we\u0027re assuming that s has a way to get classical messages to a or B or C or anybody else in this network but you know the way it\u0027s getting them to this is we are forwarding this hop-by-hop through the through the through this through this network there is no requirement that that classical communication infrastructure have the same topology but you have to be able to reach all of the nodes that you might need it might need to communicate with us so the topology for the IP network could be entirely different if we were doing this in a room this size you know they might be communicating by a wireless LAN right it doesn\u0027t matter well to some extent yes right because you are forwarding the message through the classical you are using the topology to discover the path towards the final node right and you\u0027re following pearling so to some extent there is an overlap right all right maybe I\u0027m confused the natural thing is for the topology topologies to match up but it\u0027s not a requirement there might be multiple hops "
