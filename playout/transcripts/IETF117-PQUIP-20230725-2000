So The context here, as I think most people probably know, this is an informational draft is standardizing a kind of glossary for post quantum traditional hybrids. So we mean solutions for key agreement or for signatures, which use both post and traditional algorithms together. aims are there, ensuring consistency, across Different groups in the IETF. but, you know, also hopefully, more broadly, but also making it clear what security properties and claims. And I think particularly in the signature space, we're starting to see more proposals which have different security properties. So having the language to describe that is really important, and it's clear there's we can draw from academia there as well. Yeah. So I have 3 things I want to discuss today. maybe they're on the next slide. Please Okay. That's useless. I know how to click. So, yeah, to discuss agreement on the base definitions, the came up on the mailing list. question about splitting the draft and also a kind of call for what's next. So I'll go through all of this. If you have any clarifying questions, please do jump in the mic line. if you think anything I've said is, like, really wrong but the kind of more general discussion will wait until the end. if that's okay. Cool. Next slide, please. So The kind of the draft starts with a sort of basic definition section, and I think it's important that we get these right, because they all the other definitions are based on them. And the the kind of the simplest 3 of those are traditional algorithm, meaning an algorithm which is like, based on either interjecturization or discreet log. post quantum algorithms and also post quantum and traditional hybrid schemes. There's kind of some questions about this language in meetings."

The response as there were were basically positive. But there were some tweaks which I'll make, but they're basically positive. So I guess what I'd like to ask this group is I would like to now bank these and say we can go ahead and kind of define the more interesting language. but I wanted to open that up today as well as on the mailing list. this thing 1, So the next question was about splitting the draft. So When I first introduced this at secdispatch, that were One option that was proposed by a few people was splitting the draft in 2. So for one draft on terminal g for hybrid chems, and one on terminology for hybrid signatures. I think the reason it's given the the main reason for this is that We expect the chem's discussion to be more straightforward. So a chem's draft could potentially be published more quickly. But, also, because the kind of progression of chems and signatures in the IETF is is different paces. sound, sound the terminology work can mirror that. I think the kind of the the arguments against splitting this is I think there'd be quite a lot of duplicated work. Quite a lot of the language is either the same or very similar. There's also a risk that We also give up when signatures come along. And I think that's that's actually The language is harder, but, therefore, it's arguably more important for that reason. And then there's also this potential for lack of alignment. I guess, My proposal would be that we we keep them together. I think it's it's going quite well. But that's you know, it's not my draft anymore. This is a decision for the group. So opinions on that would be really welcome. And then the final thing was So I think I this this draft has got, I think, a decent structure. There's been some additions suggest on the list recently by Mike which I think are really good suggestions."

I'm Jonathan Hoyland's Cloudflare. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to read this draft, but is is the idea that we would use it like the not must like like like I am using the terminology of of RFC whatever is 10,000 I mean, it I guess, less strictly than that. So it's not kind of normative language where if you use it, it must mean what names in that draft. Well, as in if I say in my in my RFC, I'm using the terminology as in draft 10,000. then we don't have to worry about other people using it differently because I'm just being clear that I'm using this flash and Yes. Yes. So, yeah, there's no there's no forcing anyone to use this language, but it gives somewhere to kind of root that language. So, yes, which is one of the reasons we'd like to move this forward a little bit quicker so that it can be out before some of those others. Sounds good. Phil, Yeah. Actually, I was gonna say that in terms of the progression. I mean, it's important to get started on this first. but you know, this is a terminology draft.

We actually have the author. Back here. Hello? it made some really nice suggestions around properties that you might want out of your hybrid signature. Different gradations of non separability properties, they define the term true hybrid Those seem to be, like, really useful concepts. We're having a lot of debates about And I've seen them more in the chem space, but they're gonna also circling the signature space. What protocols actually need If you have a certificate, then do you need you accept weaker properties of your crypto primitive if you if the protocol doesn't have certificates that just has pinned keys, then maybe you need stronger properties of the affirmative And I thought this draft would be an amazing place to define those terms, so we have a common understanding of what properties are that we may or may not want in a protocol, Actually, Mike, before you step away, since you are the author of a draft or 2, which would be using this, and lamps. If I remember it correctly. how do you feel if this draft takes a while to finish in order to get all of that right versus timing for getting your draft out. I mean, that's one of the things I would love to see folks in line saying is finish this now and rev it later or whatever, or take your time and get it right. Do you have a feeling on that?

I think this draft is trying to address the ladder, I think that would be really useful because I think we can actually move forward, and I think we could flee progress some documents, to get some working experience with some basic things, you know, hybrid chems, for example, So curious what people think there. I would be very happy to have a set that is not the and all be all set of everything that we wanna talk about and still also have some of those other terms defined in another document. Great. Thanks. Aaron, Hi. Also in the LPGP like, working group. We have a draft that we are so far not planning on splitting. So perfectly fine for us if you keep it together.

It's more interested in about the specific terms to use, rather than the cryptographic definitions and properties. I think that for the last day will be an effort of our research or academic effort, first get a consensus around that and get the research completely right prior to putting in the ID of the So centralizing these drafting to move the common terminology that we use rather than the cryptographic property seems like a good place to start prior to actually looking at any formalization of mathematical properties. k.

This is actually very helpful. helpful. I I don't mind the draft taking a while. I'm also not a huge fan of going ahead and hybridizing all signature schemes, but I understand why some folks feel the need do that. And so if they are gonna do that, we should make sure they name stuff properly. in particular, thinking of conversations yesterday in the Jose working group, especially around PKE and things like that, being able to get good naming and consist and naming for signature schemes or for HBK schemes the quite quite helpful because then it's providing guidance to the working group as to what's do. So I think keeping it all in one since there's so much overlap in the guidance. And if it takes a little while, it takes a little while. The one thing I would say though is if it is gonna take a while, we should make sure we are broadcasting to group that are you know, defining these things so they're aware of it. Right?

Yeah. Next slide, please. So, essentially, I think we are all quite aware of this impact of quantum computers and cryptography asymmetric cryptography is considered to be broken because of Peter shows algorithm for finding an order of an element. Basically, it solves the order finding problem, which is essentially in solving an instance of the hidden Subaru problem in finite a1000000 fields. And so and for Symmetric crypto, you have Love Grover who shows how to search basically brute force and unstructured search. with the root end complexities, basically, a quadratic speedup. But doubling the key sizes theoretically ensures that it's supposed to be quantum safe. I stress on the word theoretically here. And so yeah. Next slide, please. Yeah. As explained in the previous slide, Shores algorithm, basically, it solves discrete log as well as the factorization problems in RSA that we have, which is again, an instance of the hidden subgroup problem for finite a billion groups. and it actually works for multiplicative, which is essentially used for a finite field. discrete log problems or additive, which is used for the elliptic curve problems.

So, basically, paralyzing it won't offer significant gain in cracking the key. And this still standardizes AES 128, which is also the 1st level of security for post quantum protocols. Yep. Next slide, please. Well, I think this is an interesting attack or I think called it's called different names. It's called store now decribilator or privacy monitoring or Harvista and decip later, So an attacker can basically record your session, and they in the handshake phase, they can actually obtain the pry obviously, the public key and They can use SHORE's algorithm to get the private key And that private key is basically used to get the basically, the shared secret that can be used to extract ultimately the plain text. later on when a quantum computer or cryptographically relevant quantum fall tolerant quantum computer becomes available.

And they actually I mean, the hardness is reliable on the basically, the collision resistance or the premage resistance of the hash function. Yeah. moving on. Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. yeah. So these are some Well, I'm no. It's it's gonna take some time to go through the table. So I'll just give some key points here. So these are security levels that has been laid out by NIST, and it's defined, basically, as a function of the resources that you might need to break AES or short 3 algorithms. So in case of AEs, it's the optimal key recovery or for Chargebee, you have the optimal collision attack. Now engineers or users can leverage the required algorithm based on the security level, based on their particular use case. So you have fiber 512, which is has the AES hardness for AES 128. You have dilute them 2 for chart through 5th Charge 3256 and so on. But, unfortunately, we didn't find any security level for level 4, we'd be happy to welcome some suggestions if anybody has any idea about level 4"

So classical perspective, you have the mathematical vulnerability attack. You have the algorithm attack, and you also have the side channel attack.

Cryptographic agility from an engineer point of view, it's very essential to have these this point because these threads are rapidly emerging, and I think as you can see, it's every day you have some new discussion going on.

So One of the problems that I'm seeing with hybridization and some of the discussions that already have been happening is that If you do hybridization in a naive way, you end up multiplying the amount of SciFA suits that you end up by an huge amount. Like, each hybrid each hybridization of 2 schemes should be seen as its own Cypher suite, And so if you allow any arbitrary hybridization you end up with, like, the product of all of the the safest seeds that you have I don't think that is a good idea. I think that that makes the system much more complicated. It increases implementation complexity. and it sort of gets away from, like, cyber suites having a well defined role in the system. So I do think that we should wherever we can have have like, as few as possible safest suites, and that means making an hybridization decision for the Cypher suite and moving on and not trying to combine everything especially when it comes to to the to signatures, this came up previously already here, I don't think that we like, if our if whatever we are working on at that point doesn't need Falcon for sample. we should just not have fucking in there.

The main reason that we have both is that Some of our workloads have a lot of requests coming in to the point that they can't really afford the the forward secrecy. So Looking at how this works, looking at how this works, we have 1st client in it message, which Since the static ECDH key, visit certificate, to to the server, the server then can since its own static ECDH key alongside with its certificate, And at this point, can already compute the shared secret and send confirmation of that shared secret over and the protocol like, the handshake protocol finishes this client confirming this shared secret. So this is a standard protocol, what you do when you have an authenticated ECDH key, the alternative would be TLS where you have an ephemeral ECDA key, I need to sign it in this case, the ECDH keys already authenticated and part of 8. Next slide, please. Okay.

If it is successful in in decrypting this, it will confirmed that it resumed this session not send its credentials because that's not necessary because it's a resumed connection. So we already checked credentials previously. and the rest of the flow is remains the same. Okay. next like this. So this is the main problem that you get into when you do PTC. If you look at ALTS, before adding anything PQC related you can see like, I've made these little boxes where every box is one bite Like, you can see how bad this gets. Like, Next to for 5 19, key share is 32 bytes protocol overhead and even the certificate isn't. that much larger. Like, even if you use RSA, it's like four lines instead of one line. and so on.

Otherwise, we would have used Kyra already. then this gets very large. There's, like, more than a kilobyte of of data in the handshake message now. Same is to for Kywa, sizes are very, very similar.

But, otherwise, this this works perfectly fine. The fix is fairly straightforward. You just don't do it on resumed connections the resumption secret is derived from the session secret anyway. And so you already have the same quantum protections on resumed connections say for for all the forward secrecy discussion, but that is independent of PQC. Next slide, please. Okay. So the whole thing took us about 3 years from starting with the project to now, And, like, part of this was really A bunch of mistakes that maybe we could have seen coming, like, things like adding forward secrecy to a flow that kinda intentionally didn't have forward secrecy. There is there was also quite a few bugs that we covered in our implementation, just by having it at scale, one thing that happened was a a literal stack overflow, like, Not that there was a that that there was an array that wasn't bounced checked, but that the stack was too small to contain the keys because the keys got so large."

But you also want to, especially when you're working on standards. start working on the other parts of PQC as soon as you can because it's going to be complicated. Like, adding quantum safety against for early store now, they could later attacks for TLS. is fairly straightforward. There's, like, drafts and that's that do that already. doing the same thing for signatures is going to involve some Heart discussions is going to also be a good opportunity to actually, like, maybe make X Five Four Nine a little a little bit less scary. So, like -- Good luck with that. We we have an opportunity here. Like, I mean, I mean, it's not so like, the main reasons that nobody wants to touch X509 standards right now is that Why would you touch something that works right now? If it doesn't work anymore we could actually make it better I I can't really say what better looks like, but I think Xf9 doesn't"

So that certainly is a point that as a standards committee is very much something to appreciate that signatures are going to be much more complicated than just the additional encryption in transitor Hpeakeven. And we should take the time to do that and do it right. And try to avoid some of the mistakes that we've made in the past and learned from hopefully. And the last thing is that, yeah, hybrid deployment is great. and allows us to do these things without too much risk. But keep in mind the things that I said as well about hybrid also has the potential of just loading the amount of sample schemes that you have very quickly and making a system more complicated without the need of it being more complicated. Alright. Next slide, please. Yeah. That's all that I had. And like to thank you for your attention, and for the -- We have time for just a few questions. We still have one more presentation. If folks have questions get in the queue, not, I think your email address was on the If first slide? I think so. Nope. No. It's not. It's first initial last name@google.com.

Alright. this is just gonna be a a quick update on what's going on in Lamb's for those of you who don't follow it that closely. It has been a lot of very complicated and very lengthy discussions over a number of years. Some of actually the the discussions that have gone on in Lam actually ended up in PQC for engineers. So there's actually a lot of you are very interested in a short summary of how hybrid has gone. There is actually a section in PQC for engineers that discuss some of the same things about, hey, is generic composite a good idea and things like that? and, you know, totally agree with the last speaker. Be careful about just allowing entire universe of combinations. There's lots of people that's an idea that's gonna get resuggested over and over. and over again, and it's still a bad idea. anyway, as far as the stuff that's actually going on at lamps, there's a lot of these things turn out to be relatively small and straightforward once figured out the right way of doing them, which is great. That's sort of how engineering is supposed to work. So the first one is actually a great thing about how post quantum photography will work for CMS. And so that's the summary draft that Russ is writing. in working group last call right now. The He's been resolving comments as quickly as people can throw him at him, but they haven't given up yet. I think he will tire them out pretty soon. So I've got good feelings about this working group call, but that's what's going on there. the The PKICS and CMS updates are actually pretty straightforward. We've got most of that figured out where most of the issues are still we don't have OID from from NIST for the algorithms. And so that should be resolved later this year or early next year, and that will unblock a huge number of things. So as soon as there's an official nest approved way of saying this is dilithium, that will be great."

    "text": "D So that's sort of the end state. A lot of the work in lamps has been around transitions and cryptotrans are always the hardest part the end state and the final state are much easier. And also, we've discovered along the way that Chems are a lot more ease a lot easier than signatures. I think everybody's noticing that. these days. So the composite chem draft composite is like hybrid, but instead of taking trying to put two keys into a certificate and try figure out how that works. Composite says the best way. It's very similar to the the the other stuff that people are doing. The best way to take a to consider a pair of a traditional and a post quantum algorithm is to actually see it and put it together and and just have it as one blob. So you have just one algorithm and one key. and that works a lot better with a lot of the tooling and infrastructure. So there's a draft that shows how to put keys together for the purposes of using an account. And so that's just recently adopted. So watch that one if you wanted. You'd follow how that's going. that a lot of people instead wanna avoid all this hybrid and composite stuff in run 2 parallel PPA's and transition between the two. That is a perfectly reasonable approach. There are some questions about if you are running 2 parallel PKIs, how do you sort of make sure nobody's playing games with which certificate matches which certificate So there's a draft about that if you wanna follow sort of the emerging discussion about what's the best way to do that. There are some serious challenges there especially because of the fact that the traditional side all of your cryptography is eventually broken. Right? So the 1 of the 2 pairs will never be able to have a strong binding to the other. and how much you care about that is a matter of debate. The last thing I wanted to say is there was a lot discussion around the adoption of the composite graphs, the composite"

I I eat half anymore. It's really just a there's more work needed. It turned out to be a lot harder than a lot of us expected it to be. And so I think the best thing to say about kind of deposit signatures is an area where, please, if you are interested in it, additional thought and analysis would be very helpful. We still don't really have a good idea of how a transition will work for signatures even though at the end state for signatures is a pretty straightforward forward. So that's the updates for our lamps. If people have questions more than happy to answer them. You can enter the queue or you can go to the lamps meeting, but Yep. That works as well. -- any questions that are relevant to nonlampsy people in the room. Open out, That was Russ Yelling. Thank you, Jim. So good. Okay. Thank you, Jim.

Jeff, the last things, we will start as we said some consent some call to actually the adoption of the per square tons of engineer draft. suspect to hear that, and please participate in the mailing list after that. I don't think we have any other business at the moment. So we did have the question about -- Oh. -- just factors and such like that.

Can you start a document on just like even a bare bones what are the requirements and such. and toss it towards the group. I don't think so. Okay. because the the the answer is Whatever API you're using, make sure that it lines up with the fields. oh, the fields then have to be coordinated across all those product.
