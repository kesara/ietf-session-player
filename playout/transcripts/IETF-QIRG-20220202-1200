    "text": "right so what we get is a somewhat scalable architecture for secure quantum cloud application you can also run some distributed quantum computing on this with this type of architecture now the only the only detail i would say in addition to having a quantum computer is that first it's not known when i said here you start from a qkd device you know that in practice qkd devices especially the uh the part that emits the photon can be can be done very easily using attenuated states it's not known that you can do it with attenuated state for for secure quantum cloud computing so you might need true single photon generators which are not easy to to to build and in order to connect your quantum computer to the network you might need for example this looks very much like a superconducting qubit so you might need some frequency conversion which is also difficult to to implement but at the end of the day these devices i believe that they are simpler to build than a quantum computer in the first place right so so so there are lots of details in the implementation even uh even you know if the research or the development of quantum computers uh is doing well these days uh there is a lot more to do to uh to to get this kind of application right so so this is exactly uh well this is one of the things that we spend research effort on is to try to show that this is this vision that we have is possible in practice um okay so let me let me conclude here i introduced this architecture the queue line we like to think about it as a quantum ethernet"
