And it is a competitive process as a billion dollars does not go that far when you divide it up by 574 So we had an outcry from reservations from trial leadership from tribal broadband potential builders, from people that were actually building broadband and those that wanted to manage their communication services and apply for these funds, there was an outcry for information"

They manage sometimes their own electric grid, green energy grid depending They manage a lot of their, you know, YouTube resources and different things, but, you know, broadband is a new animal So many tribes reached out to us and we were very open to going to reservations and you know having sessions with tribes that needed support but all of the reservations were closed due to restrictions for the pandemic. And they did not want to any, you know, outsiders coming in to spread potential issues. So I have some acreage in Southern California and we chose to support this by inviting people to my house in Southern California and we created what we are now calling the tribal broadband boot camp And it hosted 29 people from seven different tribes the first round and we were very focused on wireless technology because they had just received most of those tribes had just received their 2.5 gigahertz license from the FC through a tribal priority window that was open for them specifically So they were interested in how to deploy their 2.5 gigahertz and then how to maybe find funding and then how to apply for the federal funding that was coming along. We had a three-day event. It was miserably hot It was 103 Fahrenheit for three days And we hosted it in what I call my zombie bunker"

And the first, the first camp was funded by Internet Society and we thought that this was an overwhelming success but we were afraid that it wasn't true to keep going whether or not it was going to be successful. So we actually decided to have a second one just to prove that it was, you know, as good as we thought it was. So we had 45 people come from 30 tribes again.

And so, they have a $65 million grant from NTIA National Telecommunications Information Administration, and they are now a partner of the state of California in California's attempt to build roughly 8 to 10,000 miles of middle mile fiber that's missing in the infrastructure of California's networking, and they are, they partnering with the state of California and building a 20 I think it's a 23-mile section obviously reducing their costs on on you know building that for themselves, but then also operations and maintenance contracts and actually being, you know, building a sustainable business out of this so we're super excited.

In engaging some of these vendors, it was very apparent that we were able to get things donated um quite about of stuff donated for free and we were looking at the amount of stuff that we were able to get to us and we thought why we have this space why don't we just create a network that people can actually function with and make a broadband playground So at my house in Southern California we have created this network um as you see on the left-hand side of the slide there, there is a"

Yeah federal funding is off an onerous project and the application process is quite involved With the application for the NTIA funding called Tribal Broadband Connected program you know that the application was extremely long and it was very detailed Clearly, they were looking for shovel-ready projects that were at the point where they had already a general understanding of what they needed for their community and they needed and they were looking to either further device that or to start building that And a lot of tribes weren't in that, in that space yet. They were in a, further develop that or to start building that and a lot of tribes weren't in that in that space yet they were in the space of hey we think we know what we need but how do we prove it?

And then where there was, you know, tactical or technical aspects of the application, we actually had to work with NTIA get folks in touch with NTIA to be able to walk through the process and as some of you know and some of you don't know, this they built the airplane while they, after they pushed it off the edge of the cliff for this one they did not have staff to support it. They did not have the application developed in the in the question format that they even wanted to report against. They've actually gone back since then and made made applicants of the first round readjust what they presented to better, I don't know, to make it quantifiable or or qualifiable for NTIA to be able to manage that grant moving forward. So it's been really complicated Round two got a lot better because they had sorted out some of those bugs that they that they created while they were building the first one. But I'd still say it's not a perfect process. Federal government funding is tough to apply for it. I've written applications as big as 120 pages long.

We can get the object sizes smaller because Jason contributes a growing part to the trends size, and we can also get other message sizes more smaller. For example, with DNS, which always poses a big latency bottleneck to the web. Next slide, please So we propose seabor as a possible solution the consigned binary object representation, which is smaller than Jason It allows for a vision of message fields and there is also an extension called Pact C-BOR, which allows for value compression Next slide, please first of all why is he was smaller than jason well it's encoded in binary as a simple example. I give you please. First of why is C was smaller than JSON? Well it's encoded in binary as a simple example I give here an integer. In Jason this is 12 and this, of course, next slide, please. Because it's ASCII, it's two bytes. And in Cbor, next slide, please, it's just a simple integer um and if you uh look at this integer in detail, next slide please you see that this is actually a C seabor header which is the encodes the type in the first three bits and in the remaining five bits there is an indicator, which for this particular integer is just the value of the entity next slide please if we look at a more complete advanced example for example maps next slide please there we see that the header gets a little bit more complex"

And because, of course, this half-precision floating point number doesn't fit into this five bit the indicator now becomes just a value that says okay the value actually is in the next two bits uh bytes Next slide, please. And again, we can skip that too, yeah. And the structure also, because Cibor is a structure type, we can also, it allows also for elision For example, when you look at a DNS message that is then encoded in seabor we could for example, use the message sections or a CBOA array, and this allows us already to allow the count fields of a DNS message in favor of the error lengths. You can elize the sections that are not used and use context clues instead. For example, if you have a query, and you have only one section in there, it's probably the question, so just assume that it's a question And you can also allite fields that with commonly used values, for example, most of the DNS messages on the internet use the in record class. So if that is used, just delighted Next slide please.

So they are identified by a hash, shah one hash They have a size. They have the content and code in Base 64, and also there is the encoding which states that it's base 64. Next slide please.

And we also want to discuss this CBO DNS message format and the CBODNS message format moment working in the co-working group which will be on wednesday 930 and we also want to discuss this sebo dns message format and the sebo working group sadly i have to be on the plane for that or already. So this is planned for IETF 100 in Dublin. So thank you Are there any questions? Hi, I'm Shane kerr. So there was some existing work in DNS with the CDNS format Is that is the reason that that wasn't used? because that's mostly for static data loss? and things like that? Well, it's mostly for storage And so it does a lot of things where it yes made things smaller, but for example all this illusion i talked about isn't done in that format and so you in some cases actually get a bigger format than with normal DNS message format is mean the cdns is more as far as i remember is more about instead of using um zone files so the CDNS is definitely intended for message data, for packets and I think in general it it it is what similar results I guess to what you see. You get like 10x improvement in size so something to consider but it may not be useful if it's not over a large set of data. Because I think a large part of the efficiency with that comes from, for example, storing pointers to specific data and then using that everywhere throughout One other quick question is, did you look? at the CPU performance? of this and we looked at the runtime"

I think it works really well with the kind of technology that we build But in this era of I would say, it was sort of outlandish hype cycles. We've been through Bitcoin There's a couple distributed ledger working groups here. It's good work. But there were a hype cycle. Hopefully no one is going to push back on that We're in the midst of the AI hype cycle. I feel like we're in the fall now. We've gone through summer. Things are starting to sleep down on that hype cycle And similarly, Starlink Leo has a feel of a hype cycle, but it's also one that I've experienced Again, you go back historically, you go back to things like the Arridium Network, which they stood up and immediately went back cycle but it's also one that I've experienced again but you go back historically you go back to things like the Arridium network which you know they stood up and we immediately went bankrupt and you know, the question is really whether there's enough of a use case for these kind of networks to make them subsist in the long term Now this is a panel that has made, I think, Betz, career bets, saying this is a real space that's going to be a around for a while.

But of course, there's certain, let's say enough places we don't even have fiber or the fiber is broken or maybe the network is shut down by whatever reason so in this case if people need to commit they probably need to communicate like in a wireless system network is shut down by whatever reason so in this case if people need to communicate they probably need to communicate like in a wireless way for example we have a cellular system but in the seller system you also need a backhaul network as well So I would call like this wave of Leo called the second generation.

We still want to ensure global connectivity for the benefits of everyone that wishes to be connected. Now, if there is an mission that Leo's might have, it would be that one to ensure global connectivity to those unconnected During the summer school, we had a lovely French page student who studied the case of Nunavut in the north of Canada and the policies around it. So our task has been to try and understand whether the multi-stake model still applies and if it can help us in this shift to influence in internet governance, or maybe we should abandon these ideas of early 2000s and say well it didn't work multi-stakeholder governance is a lovely concept, but since the government have shifted to infrastructure, it's all national regulation. So, for example, a state like Israel allows start into its territory, it has every right to apply its security and data governance laws to obtain data transferred through those infrastructures These are open questions that Berner and I try to address as the global geopolitical landscape of all infrastructures. These are open questions that Berner and I try to address as the global geopolitical landscape evolves, a local project that also attracted our attention. I have not heard yet mentioned this iris Square.

And when we read the policy papers of different jurisdictions, in relation to Leo's, we see that the commercial aspect of it is sometimes equally, sometimes even less is pursued to be less important than its strategic value So I think that also needs to be taken into consideration as to why certain regions or states are also investing in Leo's although commercially it doesn't seem like a very profitable business investment So this is what I wanted to add"

I haven't seen those questions in particular, but again, it's like, even with these cheaper rockets, it's expensive. But then the idea that there's going to be two or three other players joining seems implausible But at the same time, it's happening And so I don't know if it's one of those things where things shake out. So there's, you know, the Sith rule of two, there's always two players and the third ones just fall out or you can actually create a competitive marketplace in Leo's I guess I guess we will see. I see some in the queue, but I want to finish this sort of introduction line of questioning. So, and then we'll step out to the queue Oh, yeah, sure So talking about the economy, like kind of so there's a few things involved for the like enough, we have a cheap satellite and the cheap, let's say, rocket launch cost. But meanwhile, of course the Leo, you have to like replace the satellite at once every like a four or five years So that's what is continued cost. According to people close to Stalin Space X, like their investment, is about $10 billion. And then they have like kind of three million users and roughly speaking kind of if each of them like a pay, let's say $1,000 actually kind of commercial users actually pay much more than that $1,000 a year. It's already like kind of three billion dollars a year. So that's why kind of no wonder people say like a star link actually is cash call for Space X to eventually send people to Mars not here like around the Earth. So I don't think like, enough at least let's say for Starlink according to their book as well people question the book but according to their book, they have been cash flow more than half a year ago. Let's say cash flow positive, they say again like enough in terms competing Stalin is not the only kid on game we also have the Kuiper, but they need to get the"

There's a level to which I am personally uncomfortable with the idea of like Starlink being the center of the internet for the rural world. And we talked about multi-stakeholder networks and how you know the internet is designed as a place for multiple networks to interconnect And, you know, that's not the arc architecture. And so I'm curious about how you all feel about that like in a world where where or two of these Leo starts to really dominate rural connectivity, starts to push out alternatives solutions of terrestrial wireless is sort of the classic competitor to this space.

I'm not arguing that But it's just a drop in the bucket as compared to wireline We certainly need more than one Leo provider. That's certainly a viable, whether we can support three or not, that's a very interesting question And again, it comes down to costs I don't know where that's going to shake out I don't try to be an economist and I certainly don't have the numbers for it But it's certainly doable and it's doesn't scare me because I don't think that the existing access providers, terrestrial access is going to go away because of this Certainly some of the bottom feeders might get shaken out but the primary ones I don't think are going to be significantly affected, and especially with 5G coming, I think we're going to see more competition and that's very good Yeah, I can do a follow quick up, a quick follow up. So I don't think there's only like a one or two, let's say, kind of even for consumer market, for them for like both Starlink and Kuiper, they're U.S.-based. Of course, they provide a global service as well for them policy kind of Starlink and also one web, by now they do have global coverage but they don't have like a landing rights in every country right now so for the employee kind of the in Europe they have a project called iris two which is like somehow they want to compete with Stalin and I believe like a"

So if you have like a dish with you, if you travel around the world, you hope that you can also hook up with different satellites or maybe different service provider as well to provide your survey all the time. It's like now if you have to get a new dish, get a new set of equipment when you go to from another country one country or another country. So this happened like enough by now 30, 40 years ago when we have GSM At the very beginning, like enough, you're still a little phone only works with one provider in one country Now, like, enough, you can free loan. Of course, at additional cost all around the world as well So definitely kind of, the landing rights is something to make sure that eventually we're going to have multiple service providers not only one or two from one country The second thing is like kind of, um yeah i would just leave it here bernard giovanna Thank you want to? Should I? Go for it, Bernard It's all yours. Okay, so competition is important I think, in every industry But when it comes to geo-broadband connectivity, I do not see, I don't think the competition should necessarily come from a other geo-broadband companies.

So they were willing to benefit, but that definitely rely on it alone. And in the UK, the regulator of Com, they are trying to create a competitive environment for Leo Broadbank companies And for example, that involves place gateways, the ground infrastructures in they are trying to position them strategically so that they could have as many companies as possible operating safely within their jurisdiction And just as our fellow panelists, mentioned, these regulators hold the ultimate decision-making power when it comes to landing rights. All of these countries need to acquire licenses and authorizations from each restriction that they are willing to provide their services in. And the range of licenses and authorizations change according to the type of service that they are planning to provide. If they are working with the incumbent telecom operator, the licenses and authorizations are the number of them jared mauch less and the time required to acquire that license and authorization is also much less and so the cost is much less.

I also note the interesting conversation in the chat, highlights it that infrastructure is infrastructure falls out it, digital sovereignty. I also note the interesting conversation in the chat, highlighting that infrastructure is infrastructure falls outside of the multi-stakeholder model, that's something we've covered in our report as well. I'll just briefly try to address this, and then I leave it up to you, Curtis to provide feedback on how we might wish to steer that discussion. I think what we're trying to address here is whether these new infrastructures that are rapidly developing, you call this a fad and make that's all it is. Maybe this interest will fade out and we will come back to fiber, terrestrial infrastructure We seem to have missed the opportunity to provide input from the mother multi-stakeholder community for 5Gs So I'm curious to hear feedback from the IETF colleagues We were much too late for subsea cables that infrastructure is out of scope for us But lios are happening now. They're evolving right now. Is there room for this Tunis? agenda promise to be addressed through the multi-stakeholder model? should we just drop our weapons and say, no, no, no this is by far out of scope for us It's simple infrastructure. States should regulate Maybe the latter is indeed the truth And as your question indicated, maybe we will come back"

Thank you Yeah, I don't get to see the chat, unfortunately, so I'll let Jane manage that part There's like a whole bunch of threads I kind of want to pull out here, but I also want to make sure the cue is now two people and there's some space for it I do think that I want to push back a little bit on the like competition element of this, which I do feel like Leo's are indirect competition with terrestrial wireless. A lot of the stuff that Matt Rantanin is doing, the little bit on the like competition element of this, which I do feel like Leo's are in direct competition with terrestrial wireless. A lot of the stuff that Matt Rantanin is doing, just as a concrete example, not picking on Matt's networks or anything but those are folks who are going to debate do i want to join the Hopi network or do I want to just buy a Starlink from my house and that is a decision that is present just over the last few years And I think Starlink in particular has a number of advantages over those local networks And so it seems to me that there will be some, you know, effects on those kinds of networks. I agree at a high level that the fiber networks offer fundamentally different service And so if you need fiber-level connectivity Starlink will meet that need for you But a lot of the wireless ISPs out there, I'm in the Facebook group which are delightful as it little working groups, all it is is them fighting with Starlink and trying to talk about how to convince their customers to stay on the local wireless networks, which often are more performant and have better responses, at least according"

Go Yeah, I can mention so, I don't think Staling can Leo is to replace like a, the ground in infrastructure at all. Like if you have ground infrastructure, whatever you have let's say fiber, even like a wireless SP, most time like enough, they are cheaper and also like another depravity a good enough service as well. Stalin is only for the place you don't, it's not possible to have a while, let's take an own airplane or like on, let's say, kind of cruise ship in addition like now starting a could also be the back hall for these like a wireless, ISP as well, because remember like enough, you do have a wireless ISP but you do have a wireless ISP, but I need to backhaul into, like, another, some bigger cities into the internet as well. So in this case, like, enough some of the service provider for that one way they targeting on like a kind of enterprise community network also starting has something similar, they call like a community gateway so instead i have individual dish like those like small dishes, now like you can also, let's say kind of a one community dish, a community gateway in Alaska as well. So basically, if you have local distribution network, you don't have like a purchase dish everyone for every household but instead you set up like a ground station there so in this case, like kind of this ground station can suddenly cover the entire city or entire remote town and things like I think there's competition definitely. We like to think more competition but there's more chance for collaboration among those service providers. Even for Starlink, majority of travel by Starlink is over fiber on the ground They mostly can use the satellite for the first, like, in the hop, or the last hop is the band pipe"

I just wanted to make a comment that if we want to know why we need a multi-stakeholder governance, for satellite internet, it's just enough to look at the recent case that has been ongoing at the IT whereby Islam Republic of Iran has complained that Starlink is being used in Iran and that ITU should, there is a broad that considers these complaints and that I being used in Iran and that ITU should, there is a bureau that considers these complaints and that ITU should force Starlink to stop its services which goes against our value of in interoperable global internet And imagine, and the reason that is, is that because also we have a multilateral process that is looking after this issue If this process was, multi-stakeholder, if this was ICAN, if the Islamic Republic had gone to ICANN saying that all the domain names, of Iranians inside the outside should be all confiscated what would we have said? We would have said, no that's silly. This is why we need the multi-stakeholder governance"

Thank you What was the response from the ITU to that request? So the case is still ongoing but there are preliminary ruling was that actually Starlink can tell where the divide are and they should and they should actually disconnect those devices that are that are connecting from Iran but there are many, many, so the agency that is in charge of enforcement is in Norway, Norwegians and the US"

Is this okay, Berna? Yes, okay So, okay, so um, the ITU is tasked with coordinating and allocate frequency spectrum and associated orbital slots. So this is there mandate, yes, ITUR only does this. And it has been working very efficient and effectively over the years because also of the satellites that are in the lower orbit, medium orbit, orbit, geostationary orbit, have been able to function without interfering with each other without interfering with each other services because this coordination mechanism works And so the landing rights we had just mentioned had been a recognized way of provide services via satellites for many, many years. I mean, since the seven this is the basis upon which satellite services have been made available in a dress jurisdiction other than where the satellite is registered to. And so broadband services you know, connectivity services, broadcasts, services, they are all based upon this understanding that where a satellite company is to provide services within a country they need to get the proper authorization and licensing. So when it comes to human rights issues, the IT does not have a mandate"

So while you want you know, we would all like to see that nobody's in internet access is disrupted for unjustified genes other satellite services as well. So while you want, you know, we would all like to see that nobody's internet access is disrupted for unjustified reasons, the system in place works And so I think the proper venue to discuss these issues would be outside the IT and ITU should continue its technical role in coordinating frequencies and allocating orbital slots or orbital planes where these satellite systems work But I don't know if this is this answers the question but I understand your concern and I empathize but this I think IT is not the venue for that discussion. Yeah, so I mean, I think that's a finance answer to say, or I guess an answer to say that like, you know, this is out of scope for the ITU by design. I am a little curious, it sounds like you know a lot about this, like Starlink in particular is somewhat notorious for the roaming process working kind of everywhere like you can bring it to countries where there is no agreement and it'll turn on and just operate Like, um, how?

It was not made available in regions where Russia had occupied. There was the discussion maybe the audience would remember regarding Crimea The Ukrainian officials wanted Starling to be made available there. And because Russia, because the Russian authority would not allow that, styling services were not made available. They didn't open I don't know the right word for this, but they were not made available there, you know, within that certain region. And so do you Ukrainian military could not use it. So this was so of discussed as to the power of starling within a conflict environment, but it doesn't really surprise us from a regulatory point of view because it is only, it should, it is made available where it is authorized to do so and it's not made it available where it's not authorized to be and so it was the all it was only in Iran where um styling was made available all although there was no express government authorization. And that is because the US and Iran do not have diplomatic relations In another jurisdiction where they have diplomatic relations, I don't think US would allow its companies to operate without proper procedures So I don't know if Joanna would like to add something, but starting is really going by the rules, going through every regulatory"

Just a compliment I believe neither Berna nor myself are trying to say that we need to change the way that the spectrum is distributed or broaden the scope of IT Maybe, but I think more ways we're trying to do here, that's for you guys to decide to give us feedback, is whether this paradox we have for multi-stakeholder governance and we have it for good reasons, once that Fartzi mentions so explain is there a way to use it? to ensure global connectivity that is sustained? accessible, based on those principles? that we need no reminder in this room that we put in the Tunis agenda? Or maybe we've moved away from that, and it's all down to national regulation like that one in the US telling Mr. Mosque what it is that he's supposed to do or that he is supposed to refrain from. I do struggle with this synonymous understanding of Leo's and Starlink I think it's just an example. I struggle with this also with my students when when we talk about social media, they need it example. I struggle with this also with my students when we talk about social media, they immediately think Facebook. There is so much more. So I think what we're trying to address here is that as much as Berna highlighted this, Starling is doing their best to play by the rules, whatever, however ambiguous these rules might be, but we're looking at different providers They will come into the playing field that we come into the foreground and the question is whether there are union might be but we're looking at different providers they will come into the playing field that we come into the foreground and the question is whether there are universal rules to be applied i see our next speaker in the queue taking the floor So I'll stop here.

I guess something you're something you're something to add as well Yeah, somehow like the Starling cover gives it something like a miss there. They do have global coverage, but they don't have like global landing rights as of now. But how Starling is Dewe is like those roaming users actually is quite different So if you look at, let's say, in Africa, like, even South Africa when Elon Musk was born there, they don't have, let's say, authorize service yet, but they are users using Stalin right now, using either local or maybe like original or like a global roaming service there. So I would think like enough, again, like another, this needs to be discussed somewhere, but probably not only like the IETF or maybe ITU or ITOT, those type of places because somehow like enough this is always like a mixed because for telecommunication starting for like a telephone service, there is always regulated by each individual countries But for internet computer communication it was not regulated, at least at the beginning But of course, nowadays, like, there's more and more regulation to computer communication as well. For example, like enough, for all the static users in Canada, they landed their packets in u.s because somehow like"

But if you look at it like a source American countries, almost every single country they require Stalin to have a pop there because they need to make sure like their customer, they are like an citizen, they landed their packets somewhere in that own country and they can do whatever they need if necessary Another example I can provide is like an their customer, they are like a citizen, they lend their packets somewhere in that own country and they can do whatever they need if necessary. Another example I can provide is like the recent launch of the service in Indonesia like for Stalin. So all other countries like, Stalin can use the singer autonomous system, that number that's a 14593 for all the service But by now, there's only one country exception, which is Indonesia they have a separate as name an S-number there. For whatever reason, they want but one possibility is like kind of the country who give the license to starting to operate it in a country, require them to have a separate AS for whatever reason so again like enough I think there must be people like in Stalin or maybe in other those real companies as well. They have to negotiate with each country one by one. And it depends on the situation they either like a set up like another guano station there or they have to set up a pop there, or they have to even set up like a cell separate S number there as well and this could be a very time-consuming task for yeah but at the same time, I have friends who've been running Starlink in Indonesia for years at this moment, well before all those deals got made And so I'm just confused, I guess, again, I want to be clear, I'm for it. Those guys, like, they've been providing internet to these communities it's been awesome but like you know the narrative is that this is not allowed and that if you would say no, and I just am a little confused about circling that square Maybe I can shed some light.

And thanks to ISLs, you can have a home station that has its packets landed halfway around the world So basically, Elon can provide connectivity wherever he wants and can turn it on and off wherever he wants. And this is not a technical issue. So the real issue is about landing rights and as noted that's going to take some massive negotiations on a per country basis. Now historically, I ISPs have been under the influence and control of their national lawyers It's been joked that an ISP is a building full of lawyers and one engineer That's not far our joked that an ISP is a building full of lawyers and one engineer. That's not far from wrong. It's not far from Well, anyhow Starlink and other Leos are going to have to sort this out It's not going to fall under the multi-governance model. It's you know, we have never had influence directly over the ISPs. That's not what we do that's not what we've tried to do You know, we manage the domain name system we manage routing, and those things are not really under the purview of the government and that's the way it's broken out before and I don't see that changing i don't know i'm not convinced that what you said there about the location of the ground terminals or the, landing sites is the only critical piece of it. This is, I think, with the Iranian case is a good example, the lack of ground stations in Iran doesn't mean that Iran doesn't have a right to control the use of user terminals and their communications in the area"

And then we'll jump into the queue again So, every piece of the puzzle, every piece of the satellite technology, requires a different type of license and registration. So the gateways is its separate license the user terminals that you access the satellite service requires import licensing and then it's a and then there are maybe there may be a series of other licenses for sale within the country and frequency spectrum access requires a different license which is usually granted via an auction a different license which is usually which is usually granted via a auction. So all of these require different types of licenses, so it's definitely not only where you need a gateway you would be complying with the regulators' demands It's everywhere that these satellites are providing services that they would need to acquire licenses and authorizations this is the legal system. So technically, they may be available because the footprints cannot be exactly matched to the borders, the footprint of the satellites And yet, because these satellites are more precise than their counterparts in higher orbits, it is more their footprints jared mauch more precise than those, you know, older technologies. And so that is how styling was able to not turn on the services above Crimea, but right"

But with Leo's this seems less of a problem. So we are not technically people, but this is how we understand from the on ongoing negotiations and disputes. And definitely the licenses and authorizations are not limited to the ground stations. It is a understand from the ongoing negotiations and disputes and definitely the licenses and authorizations are not limited to the ground stations it is it applies to every piece of the puzzle.

Well, no To add the I know this is a very complex problem the main problem is the spectrum is a limited resource and this is why the IQ makes some agreement for every place, every region and every country And you can see this problem at the country with the mobile system because in the mobile system, you have every country has I don't know three or perhaps four companies along every country to give the service"

But the advantage is that perhaps we can give service in in place where it's not very easy go by ground, just because the geography or the economics. For instance, I am from Argentina. In Argentina, we have a very large extension places where we have no service of interest at all. And the satellite solution is a very good one but sometimes there are companies like Starlink that gives some services without the agreement of the government and even if you have the agreement, you have to tax the people inside this country because the use of the service and this is another problem Therefore, it's really very complicated but for the perspective to give internet access to the people for instance I am working in a project where we use"

We have been working very closely with them York at ISOP, who presented a technical report on this, and it's conversations with him that have led us to believe that it's relatively easy to provide the service. The question is to make sure that those who use it are free and safe and so will not be punished in any way for disobeying national laws. Our take from the work we had done thus far, and we do encourage you to stay in touch and provide feedback is that the one point of pressure that we can exist, right now is capacity building. Everyone wants quick, fast, efficient internet access Very few, especially internet end users are asking the question where that internet is coming from and who, for example, has access to the data Satellite broadband is part of the Chinese initiative One Belt One road that invests heavily also in internet connectivity. So as much as we like to point, fingers of Mr. Musk and say, well, he might have done better is he compliant with the law?

I think we've been talking about a bunch of questions and we might have some overlap in that But with our last little bit here and I'll start with Tony what's the big question that you have in this space? TBD to be resolved? the real question is economics Are Leo networks actually? sustainable? And can we get to competition? within them? If SpaceX is the only thing who have economic lift mechanisms, then who can compete? For me, I think the biggest question is like, you know, how to make sure like the satellite network will be as efficient as the other part of the internet as well Meanwhile, like in terms of those regulation and other things, I think like enough, we have seen something similar happen before, which is the kind of telestuary mobile like kind of roaming systems. So at the very beginning like an enough each country have their own let's say kind of mobile operator thing still have, but now they all have some sort of like a roaming agreement between them so the users can actually go from one country to another country. So in this case, like this may happen to the satellite world in the future as well well do bernah So my dream would be harmonized of laws and regulations so that this technology is utilized in the best way possible and that harmonization would be possible with every and every stakeholder pitching in and added regulations so that this technology is utilized in the best way possible and that harmonization would be possible with every each and every stakeholder pitching in and addressing their concerns at relevant venues, not a single venue, but relevant venues And so when it comes"

If you want to have all of those questions condensed into four pages, it's right there. And it's also for civil society. To me, there are two buzzwords that we need to address. It's data and trust. So it's very important to know as an individual end user maybe for the standard setting community. It is also a relevant question. Who has access to that data? who can request access to that data What is that data? Is it personal data? Does GDPR apply? Can we use GDPR to protect individuals? that want to have internet access? And then it's about trust It seems that Mr Musk enjoys trust, but the next actress that might come onto the stage might struggle with that issue We've witnessed this with 5G. I'll refrain from pointing fingers but there seems to be an issue of trust within infrastructures.
