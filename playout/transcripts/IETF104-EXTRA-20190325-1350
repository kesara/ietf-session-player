East Coast who need to attend can attend that session we\u0027ll be doing the second half of extra tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the session that used to belong to Gemma and we will be going through imap4 over to during tomorrow\u0027s session today\u0027s session we will be working on these things anyway let\u0027s start here we have the know well if you have not seen it yet it\u0027s worth your while reading through that so that you understand what your responsibilities are within this group we have had in the last season we had someone show up on the mailing list with a set of requests that led us to eventually passing over to the Ombuds time and letting them know that this was happening because they were making demands and complaining about behavior other members on the mailing list I\u0027m hoping all that is resolved but to keep in mind that this applies to your interactions the ITF entirely alright moving on to the agenda for today welcome Barry osser new Area Director for this group that\u0027s right looks looks brand new yes alexia is still floating around writing stuff and involved we\u0027re going to look at the quota the submission token and anything else and possibly also talk about the rich charter today did you two want to switch orders what do you want to still go with quota first so let\u0027s start with submission tokens in Mike there yes welcome our remote people as well and yeah finally Michael sloughs ours and I have my co-author actually the one who came up with most of this stuff Timo he should be on that daddy gonna list so hopefully Timo can know no one\u0027s ever accused me of being quiet so hopefully you can can hear me in the back there submission tokens didn\u0027t mean to kind of spring this on people too much if you were at FOSDEM bron-bron "
