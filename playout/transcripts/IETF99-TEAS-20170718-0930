    "text": "our table or my optimization mechanism we found just a few flow well well beach the congestion situation and here is the smell relation for scenario for it is a simulation for the temporal congestion email elimination and the left a picture the left a picture is in the background traffic situation just now I have show show show ETA and about 20 percent link is congestion and the average congestion degree is about 10 percent but after optimization the congestion degree decreased to about 2% 2% so based on the based on the scenarios description and the simulation we think it is feasible it is available to deploy a PCE in a native network to optimize our network and the traffic and we sink for the scenarios the solution should be easy to deploy with within one domain or more domains and a solution should decrease the complexity or do not add more complexity to the current or distributed protocol and the solution should should decrease the burden on network devices and we have we have submitted to chapter 2 folder solution 1 in PC in native ID network this structure has been presented for several times and also in the in Chicago\u0027s meeting and the later I will present PDP community PCE for for our supplement so for the third further action or we want always hope to move this work forward and we find some standard a way to to do PC in native IV network and the way reach faster request for the PC in native ID networks and our working group draft and also we welcome more comments suggestions and most scenarios thank you so we pretty much exhaust the time for the for the slot what we do have a question for is to see if this is an area the working group wants to work on so before we lose their like the routing working group chair who\u0027s walking on through I guess we the question the question is is TE for native IP networks "
