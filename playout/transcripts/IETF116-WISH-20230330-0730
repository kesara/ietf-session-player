Here's some additional resources? In our search agenda. Basically, we're gonna gonna try to have We're gonna do a little bit of an update on the on the drafts that have, and then we're gonna launch into the working group charter discussion. We're gonna start with this because our Ad is double booked, and he's gonna to run away, and then we can actually talk about the the individual draft, the web draft that we're in the process of looking at charter four. So With that, I need a scribe is anyone willing to take notes during the session I do not need a blow by blow. All I need is actions taken. Mh Alright anybody?

Basically, what I did was at the reference to the media player, so we are not only they're going to tag tools store support into then the west Group but also the media players I have removed their reference to the all day products that we have in in the other, because I don't think that I didn't felt that it was I would idea to have some names put in the chat but to some other not.

Timothy? Yeah. So to prompt get. I I like the simplest attempt this. I think the only problem is that you you're widening the scope quite dramatically and without any any constraints. What I liked about it previously is you saying, like, especially something perhaps scope. Now kind of almost nothing to out.

So I did. I I I don't put I I didn't put any slide it because I thought that you had the color button not, but I mean, this we can... So so that... So I can you real quick. So that yeah draft completed working group last call. We had some revisions. That was great. Then we had meals and part of the process to get it out of the working group, we need to do what's called a shepherd right at it where the working group chairs, right? This document up that the area director then reads before he progresses it. And we found two little things that we wanna fix and neil nicely submitted pull request to do those. They are very minor and editorial. So I'm hoping what you can do Mh. Joe is just merge them and pump out a new version and then we can get the working group call started as soon as we get down with the shepherd right out. Yep. I will do it after the call. So we have the in up let's say today Fantastic. And meals, how's that shepherd right coming? It's almost done. I think there's one moment. One thing left business"

He may think fine. It kinda depends and then the whole it'll start assuming that he got the draft on Friday, and he read it on the plane on Monday. And he started a working group or an It last call. That would be two weeks. So that would be... And then the next the next step in the processes we'll get different director reviews from security and art and gen and a bunch of other places. So we may get other little revisions along the way, but think we're probably gonna be alright Okay. So on web. So I put the slides in the wrong spot. That's the problem. Here we go. I will update the chair slides and reload a new Sorry about that. Okay.

So that's why I remove it from there printed it up.

So this is the what I was talking up before a lot then they Just that extension is this to just be able to mimic what is already available in in other streaming. And players when you can just choose you you can't have the gear icon when you do have the different qualities where this that for the steam, and you can choose the outdoor not in our case would be that they that the server will choose the best available quality for based on downward estimation or you can and the player could choose to to receive a different my resolution, maybe because it was too safe bandwidth or because... I mean, you are watching it on a small so the four k, and the four k one because you a small device. So this is our also implemented as extension.

So this is not the Is entirely separate from the sd. Yep. And is it the server responsibility to do a clean transition like, Are you got a key for or anything like that? Yep. Okay. Julius? Yeah.

So I think essentially, what you're doing is your you're sending us a set parameter string that you want the server to set. And and that might be a better defined way to do this. Because, you know, the webrtc spec Api will will tell you what the effect of that's gonna be Does that make sense? Kind of because I mean, the the problem is that we have... Well we have the same in the same stream for one two different viewers. So we are not seeing what the the is sending. Yes, we are we are sending. We are just doing as we're do and as use, So then then the the viewer can receive a different as of what it is being by the.

Luckily, there's not another web protocol on the horizons. So there won't be any competition. So this could be pretty easy.
