Is there any agenda bash? I see no one running to the mic, so we'll move on. Just a reminder of our BAF goals. As per our IT policies, the buffs main aim is to demonstrate that there is support in the community. That there is a problem that is worth solving There are enough participants in the room who will work on the problem whether the scope of the problem is clear and whether there is enough reasonable probability of having success in this store, The key thing, especially for an SRV 6 opsgraph, we could we would focus on the charter And, scope is clear. Our deliverables are clear. Clear and whether we have a critical mass of operators, contributors, and reviewers in the room for this work to be potentially be successful And with that, we will start with operators as presentations.

    "text": "Some of you might be aware, the grid availability is is is being declining year on year in South Africa. What that results in is that when is when is when an unstable bridge, power goes down in a particular area. And nodes unavailable. become Now every single site that we have, been deployed with batteries on sites. Unfortunately through theft and vandalism, those sites get compromised. So what we started last year was a was a dedicated resilience program. We basically rolled out across three quarters of our sites. New, battery autonomy to increase the the power of they didn't say the availability, the network availability of nodes in the network. However, there's still gonna be slots. That file and I think that's that that's created a, you know, a concern, but also the opportunity deploy some of these advanced features to help us in terms of rerouting and finding the bid the best part throughout the network. So the first element is unstable connectivity. Either through the power availability challenges or through fiber cuts. Fiber cuts are a reality. Sometimes the fiber cuts are not necessarily, you know, a lot of them are not intentional. They're through excavations, you know, roadworks, In other cases, we had some mudslides that that we remove, whole, tracks of land, and then you have fiber and duct units that's been, cut. So that's that creates a bigger problem. So the first one is an unstable connectivity environment due to the to those factors. The second one is link congestion. Incongition is a real factor. Since COVID, we've been fortunate. Our traffic growth in the mobile network has grown between 35 to 40%. So you know, it's been good traffic growth in mobile network. Unfortunately, that growth also didn't leads to, massive upgrade programs to upgrade, you know, link capacity."

    "startTime": "00:10:00",
    "text": "That link capacity is is it if it was just on fiber, it'd be a lot easier. But a lot of these, sites, especially as you start going into rural areas, those sites on on microwave systems, those microbes are, you know, in cases, multi hop systems, So you have to upgrade different you know, links on the path. And you'll also appreciate, and we've got some slides on that. You know, in your failures and every routine, obviously, these these these these these you know, some of these key links, congest, and you have to be aware to manage that. The the third portion is that when you when you deploy outsider, an environment like an urban environment into rural environments. Often don't have the luxury of, of of simplifying an network. And you got these large ring or mesh topologies that result, and they're quite complex to manage, and we got some pictures later on in diagrams to show that, but it comes quite difficult to visualize the nodes, the links, the packet loss rates, and the latency in these East networks. The visual representation of that is quite important, and we'll we'll explain why in a second. So these are the 3 challenges that we'll go through. Let it update. Okay. So the first one is in terms of link congestions. So we we pick an area here just to give a view of of what we were describing. So On top, you've got the the mobile base station, the radio access network, it's connected through an access, ring in this case. Onto a second access ring. There goes an aggregation network that then hands off into the core network. What we've done also here is just to highlight the areas that have 5 and microwave, slides, but if you have the the pdfs, you can be able to see that the the maybe not so clear on the the the pods and the roots. So it's a mix of microwave and and, and fiber but on this particular diagram, what's quite important in the sort of what we, shown here was that, you know, there's 2 incidents over here where the the the link utilization went beyond the the thresholds. So understand that over here that this base station has got a particular parts to the network."

    "text": "It was a particular utilization, increased beyond beyond the threshold. Intervention was made. And then shortly after that, Again, it hit those thresholds. Another intervention was made. And what we're demonstrating is, obviously, then the path there's a there's an optimal path that's been that's been chosen back to the network. So this is vital. And and this happens because, like I said, depending on the time of day, you get the busy in the early, you think some industrial areas are busy hours in the early earlier part of the day? Depending on when that busier hour is net net, traffic requirements, know, the the conditional link will change. And obviously, the the the key thing here is that we're using the link congestion, use case to basically find the optimal path back to the to metric If we take that one step further, let's go to the next slide. In the next slide, what we found was that sometimes the load balance is not tomorrow. So we wanted we wanted the the ability to provide a multi path, scenario so we could use so we could balance sometimes the algorithms choose a particular part that that act your congestion works. 2 things happened in in an area of, South Africa called KwaZulu Natal. We did a proof of concept, or we deployed, SIV 6 in in this particular region. And on left hand side, what we're showing is 2 elements. The one was the packet rate improvement. So before the packet loss rate is shown over there, and we had 38% of the sites that had a a a pack loss rate greater than 10 to the minus 3. And that improves after we deployed, Slv6. To to, to, a 12% to the having a packet loss rate greater than 10 to the minus 3. I think the key thing here is that the if you look at the the the graph, change the link utilization And really what we found was that there was a massive decline in the highly congested links it was more balanced across all the links in that particular area. So if you look at the picture, you'll see the little dots represent, obviously, the the the notes and the network."

    "text": "The routers, the sell side routers. And what you have is if have a reduction in, obviously, packet loss rates, but also you have a balance traffic profile. So that was due to basically balancing the traffic across multi ports throughout the network. So that was a key, a key component. And we really wanna sell this out to other parts of the network. Because the trial was so successful. Okay. If we go to the next slide, In this particular slide, we're showing load balancing, that's throughout the network, specifically due to failures in the network. So before I was just indicating the nature of the network. Can you appreciate that when you have people thinking it goes down and then it's all down. Then an environment needs a computer, the the the the optimal path and in that party is then applied, but you'll appreciate it similar to a movie. Where you see a whole area of power going down and the grid goes down systematically. See what happens in these areas. The grid doesn't go down all at once. You have areas that go down. And then you also have battery systems that are there. Maybe the battery autonomy depicts and then a site goes down. So that happens at different phases. You need to have an intelligent system that can be able to react quick enough. To these changes. So what we're showing here is basically This particular example was a site feeding back to the corner you'll see it's it's got, again, the mixture of fiber and and microwave systems. It's quite comprehensive in the beginning. And then you start seeing this is gradual decay. Of the connectivity So you have the connectivity, the first one going down at a at a time of, at atone04 then the next one's a 10645. And the next one's a 10656. What's quite important is you can you can get an appreciation that's happening either minutes or seconds after. Another event. So the tools are basically having to recompute very quickly. Terms of finding that optimal path. And then ultimately,"

So it it's at 15:14 hours And then you have the optimal, you know, rooting again. But what you'll notice in this in this example is you have, then, you know, instead of having 2 parts to your network, even though you only got one path. This particular site back to network. And that's just based on the on the, the nature of these notes going down. Like I said, what we've done since then, we a lot of work to increase the battery autonomy on a lot of these sites. So this example was from last year, late last year, But since then, things have improved quite a bit. So we're still using a lot features around the PCE, the optimal path, the load balance in our traffic. Specifically, this example showed some of those extreme cases where you do have a number of slots going down. I think I've 49 seconds left. So I'll quickly go through the GAS map. The visualization of your network is critical. What I was explaining to to to different teams is not just important for the the transmission team. So it's important for our resilience teams and our many services teams that are finding in these areas. That's a critical factor. So there's multiple domains that can benefit from this visualization. So on this map over here, I mean, basically, they're shown on the right hand side the the the packet loss rates. And the visualization of that is quite nice. The high rate is the high the the high levels of packet loss. On the left hand side was quite nice as you can always then generate your view which shows the status the bandwidth the delay, the packet loss rates are the sort of factors And last but not least, at the bottom, you'll see Afitz. Afitz really helps you to understand the hop by hop you know, keep the the hop hop hop performance of the network. And detecting some of those key, areas where you need to have interventions. I think this particular one over here is that is 2 messages we wanted, you know, you know, firstly say it. The first one is There's a massive benefits. For your operational teams, but there's also massive benefit for the many services teams that respond to these to these areas."

Looking at areas where nodes have been going down, specifically aggregation notes, hub sites. That need to be focused on. We call them H1 and H2 sites. We've categorizing to 2 priority and that's been a real benefit by having a specialization. So no so my last slide is just saying to wrap it up you know, for for the team. Just to say, you know, thank you for correcting this I think, forum. It's always good to see operator, you know, use cases and and and some of the challenges they experiencing. We really support the end to end, SOB 6 unified standard. That's been presented and and been discussed. I think from our perspective, you know, the death. Enhancement and and some of the metro visualization elements are quite interesting for us. Like I said, they they have car that can be used not just the operational domains, but also seeing in many service and and in plain domains, which is quite important. So sorry I went over the time, but thank you very much for allowing us to present. Some use cases in our network. Thanks, Sultan. Just a reminder, we will, currently do only clarifying questions and we have enough time for broader questions. So please take your clarifying questions quickly. And we have Warren. So two things.

As somebody has born in South Africa, thank you very for showing this. You know, it's nice to see how the network's changing. I was born in Marisburg. That's great.

It's, The deck usually is fairly, longer than this one, we use it to train ops But today, inside 10 minutes, I'm only here to, give you the gist of how we did that. And, obviously, you can, contact me if you if I pick your interest enough to, follow our track. While we are Our motivation and the first thing that we did when we started to be real. With a service ex appointment back in 2020. West to, think about how we're gonna deploy the IP addressing plan back then, we, we used to call it, you said. Now it's and I apologize already if I mentioned use it a couple of times. It's just that It's been so long with that term. So with, with thesis, the first, thing was to make sure that This was, unique across the backbone that we had enough scale to address all the nodes and all the, the different items that we, that we have. We call it island, like a metro network, or a pocket of network attached to the backbone the very first thing we were asking ourselves is how can we be effective deploying this. So we came up with a method that is very much mathematical,"

The tool will generate the, you said, the locators attached to it also the, the summary address for all the, the ABR and the border of every island. And that was our our goal. And today, just gonna go over the methodology of this. So I can quickly skip, but very briefly if I'm not able to stay inside 10 minutes, I'm hoping you can take over the deck and maybe come back with some, few question or, comment, but basically, I'm gonna just do a couple review of the CSID and the the allocated just to make sure that we're on the same page because that becomes base as I move into the slides. So back then, FCD 2 16, the format that you do bits, lock and 16 bits is the the the c said, was the standard, and we standardized on it. On this, Adbell the l stands for the lens of the mask and you could see at the bottom an idea of every usage or c sets or inside the container. That follows the nodes on the on the right, the picture that you see there. Obviously, if you guys remember and I'm hoping so that there's about 6 seats per container when we use 3216 that hasn't changed in our deployment. In here, I just wanna point out a few things first in our lab, we use FCC, but in our position network, we use which is our which are ULA. So at our last IETF in Prague I was explaining the security aspect of why we went, but"

    "startTime": "00:24:03",
    "text": "here, I can almost also say that, it's because we have more bit to encode more, function in the address from the security, just keep everything up back, and and we're not leaking all side of our domain, this is the hour assumption from a network design because active on how we're gonna address this. So on top, you see the number of we were thinking and we still, think right now no more than 4. Our trick, design here can allocate for more than 4 but and we're actually using 3. We were just, using for other design perspective, and I think industry wise, we're just accures to see what other use case we can do with fax. So that's the first point The second point or the third point actually in the slide we wanted to cover at least a 128 area or ISS domain. That's a maximum in theory value. We don't think we're gonna go over 99 we wanted to make sure we could cover up to 7 large area. A larger will have up could add up to a 1025 nodes Our backbone level 2 area 0 512, but that's a a theoretical limit. So we know our aggregate them actually scale. We don't really have more than a 100 and something, noted in our backbone, area 0. So here we could use this a little bit as what's coming in the next slides. So in green, that's how we decided to encode the effects I'll go first. So those are the last two level of the second group where you see gg the service site ID and, the ISS level"

    "text": "as I think I'm gonna cover another slide It's because we were a bit brownfield. So we already did load ISS, level in areas, and it wasn't really matching the because we were ran them when we deployed IIIS a long time ago. So to match the algorithm in in our map, we ended up doing a mapping which is also embedded in our code. Which will be the first tunable of the the 3rd group. Then the node ID, the last 2 in the goal of of the 3rd group, And all that makes it, unique across our backbone. So in here, text article, that's something to pick typical for whoever has deployed Plexogrow we have, 00 for, like, locate with 0 and and they run for low latency and 199 for bandwidth and restriction, link restrictions. So that's the first thing that we had to think about before going into the the seaside In this case here, we're mapping. I'm starting to talk about the mapping between, site ID. As I said, it's the equivalent of the ISS area. That we've, we've mapped plus the node ID to make it unique. We came up with what we call sets the that which is, are the first tumable of the seaside. He said we'll have a maximum of 256 possibilities. If we lock them, then it means if we fix that, That means they are, unique, across the the backbone. That we we have if I move a little bit, the game and deliver, I'm very certain he's familiar with that. Global set, local set for services, if I move here"

Which is everything between 0 and d as you can see in the second line, the the lid is only 32 set, and it's for e to f. So we know right away if start by e all the way to aft that would be live. Which means when we calculate all that, it gives 57,000 ability for the nodes and 8000 for the lid. And which is actually describing in some draft So that's not new. What's new in here is the way we're gonna encode it in which digit the exact small, we're gonna be using to make it, unique. So here, if we're mapping the ISS and the site ID, and we have a concept of a small area or a mid zone area or a large area. A small could have only one set So a smoke for us would be less than 256. As soon as we are, 250, 5 or more. That's a medium area, less than 512. So I mean, then we will allocate 2 sets Yes. And later, I'm gonna cover, the large area will be we will be 4 sets. So which means and we will end up summarizing. 4 d ISS level, 2 area, the backbone, We decided to track it to slash 32. That's what we will inject in the island as a a default route the full gateway or default wrapped, I mean, to force from a security in policy that, Only that range will be allocated"

So if something happened like, somebody drop their filters and end up having the whole internet or they 88 enrolled nodes outside of that range, the slash it won't cross any island. Here, you have a little picture of, an area 1, with, say, ISS 71 area 1 with 1 set So the site ID 1 is not with 1 set. In this case, it's 2. If I move to give you a greater example, so on the left side, you see the ISS level 2 say it's 300 nodes. In this case, that's to set But like I said, we, we We we rounded up to a slash 32 for all locators or all flex Ado. In the island, for a 100 know that a small one, we allocate one set the medium two sets. Then we keep incrementing when it's a large for 4 sets. And and we we we, convert that this into EXADICimal. That's what you see, you see DC for, the, the large, the large one in exoticimal. As we were going into the journey, we also realized that If you have, let's say, you know, that is only ipv6 with no V4, Then how you, we used to put the loop back for the net ID inside the ISS. So in our case, We decided to use the ASR versus the locator 0. To fill up instead of the report back. Yeah. And for BGP router ID, which is a a 32 field, digit. Well, you can see the number that you're here. We have, the digit 6 for ipv6 0 for constant. Then we use that that I was talking about plus the 2 node. For the BGP router ID.

So, my take is, on network observability, at Swisscom specifically to Slv6. This is usually a slide I'm I'm showing just to raise awareness that, we we still have challenges, when changes operational configuration changes are happening in an operator network.

Crick enough. So Swiss Conti did a deliberate choice when moving from MPLS segment routing towards savis6, we wanted to have data plane visibility And This is just to highlight a little bit the history we have with, network analytic So we started around 2015. We went over onboarding as many platforms or as many network nodes as possible. Got engaged at IETF because we saw network telemetry still in its infancy. And now we have approximately 30,000 notes delivering metrics and me at least 35000000metrics per second. And every day, about 500 users, depending on what kind of role they have accessing the data. We have experience in, data plane visibility on MPLS as are since 2021. And on SOV Six, since last year, since since last August. So our first, let's say, input, or contribution he was to bring, visibility into the data plane. Small change was needed on the, let's say, MPLS data plane side in ip fix, which led into the RFC 916 team so that we can see clearly from which network protocol the labels were associated, while with RFC 9487, last year, we have now also all the s o v 6 network dimensions covered in IP fix. And we have quite a few major vendors who already implemented it. That RFC"

We have logical connection. VPN's connecting them. And, basically, on each node, PENP notes, we have exporting, forwarding plane, control plane, and management plan information, and correlate them in near real time. So for the on past aspect, and I think that's very much key for, for segment routing because you can steering the the the the forwarding pass from its source, we also want to have visibility on the forwarding pass itself, but also, where the delay being accumulated in the network. And we look first from a use case perspective what is important to us. So first of all, since we are having SLAs with customers on how much loss and delay we can have on which QS class in our network Our first objective is we want to get visibility on delay and loss on customer packet. So, basically, it's passive measured on past delay. For, hybrid type 1. 2nd is, customer packets are just following the active pass. So we want to also be able to probe, test"

And when we are failovering to the passive pass whenever we are still in that boundary or or not. It should be applicable to the ipv6 data plane, for sure, very much important is if we are measuring a delay in loss, for customer packets, we also want provider network dimensions So we want to understand which network dimension. So that can be a next hop, can be a sit can be a sit list or an MPLAS label We wanna understand, which of those data mentioned causing how much delay. And since data plan metrics are, then. Quite a lot to be exported data aggregation is very much key So we leverage a 2 level aggregation scheme on the network node and also on the data collection side. Now at the end, compared to the previous picture I showed basically, the selection process of the packet is slightly changing. So before basically on each and every note, we were sampling the packets So now, our aim is to only sample once that's ingress when the packet is entering the the segment routing domain. And that criteria, which packet, at which Candelarity should follow us follow the, the quality of service concept we have. So packets which are going into the priority queue, of, of course, we wanna see more granular. We we care more about those.

We are just matching on this direct export bit. And then basically exporting the packet again. So from a comparison point of view, basically the only thing changing is, before we were sampling on every note. So, therefore, we were not able to follow for each and every single packet, the forwarding part, now we are able to do so. Now, optionally, since we our aim is actually to match on past delay. We also add a time stamp on the very first note when we are forwarding the packet. And then on the subsequent note, we are measuring the delays of comparing the the arrival time of the packet and originally when the packet was entering the, the, the segment routing domain. And with that, The only thing we are actually adding as information at the export is to delay measurement besides the packet and the bite count we already have. So, therefore, the overhead is relatively small, so we have a very efficient way of, enriching the data with delay. Now, if we look at IETF, the different possibilities we have to, actually measure, delay and loss on the network And we feel looking on the the features, possibly we can have.

As you know, the MPS, traffic, engineering, repaying, etcetera, idea is to simplify the protocol network first. We simplify and converge all the protocol to ipv6 only. And uses of 6, b 6 provide the number of functions. So simplulicity is is the, the most important motivation behind And now this in the distributed net cloud computing network, there are millions of service located in terms of thousands of locations.

And then us, for us as the operator, we have to deploy some super controller to manage the versatile device controller across all the vendors And then this does, increase the deployment complexity and a minor reduction, high failure probability.

You know, instead of that, I think there's there's we are gonna need regardless of whatever the charter says, we're gonna need a lot of coordination between a group like this and the groups that are working on technology that's gonna feed the operations.

And, you know, that's not my job, but, you know, I'll leave it up to the agency to figure out how to do that, overlapping chairs, overlapping ADs, everything in spring, you know, whatever the the solution is, we need to to think about that and think not only about charter says, but how this will be operational going forward.

Lots of projects. They are facing a similar problems and, you know, considerations. Yep. So I do see value that we should like, generally some debatable, right, in IETF, but the question is, How? And that like, how can we generate the the the the, you know, RFCs as soon as possible because they needed immediately. Right? So the key Question is which parts that we should take? Like for a vendor, I will support all operators. So that means I hope the standards should be, you know, published as soon as possible. So for me, I think let's create a dedicated working group for the SF 6 operation that would be the best way for us. At least even, like like, unless, you want to delay something, but I don't really think we should do do so because let's do a better Internet together. Thank you. Thank you.

I think you could find a clear split between the 2, and I'm not I get it's not out out of my reading list, but I'm not so keen with them not being extended to cover a lot of this stuff, I think that that would give it very sort of split brain in terms of personality what it's trying to I think some of the questions in terms of the, both appraisal is enough people to work on it here.

I think what's being proven today from the bot, which is the biggest thing I've got out of it, is that there is clearly a community of interest for this work, and most of the argument is, well, where does this work actually get done? Does it get done in its own working group? Do we need to do it in an existing, V Six ops Group or some other working groups in the IETF.

A couple of things that have resonated with me most recently, Jeff Tanchera's whole, like, you know, if operators need a place that they can't go in their actual working group. That's evidence of a problem. And I think maybe it kind of is. Maybe what We need for this is some way that people can have discussions in a lot of the existing working groups possibly spring being one of them. So maybe like you know, a spring session focused on the operational part maybe with somehow different chairs who swap in with more of a, like, focus on stuff. You know, more of a focused way I think that that's true in many places in the IETF. So it's sort of structural problem. We'll need to go and discuss things and think about things. You know, maybe we also just serve forum for people to discuss things use cases, that sort of thing. I think is really useful to share and many, existing working groups are sort of hostile to that.
