Quick usual housekeeping notes. So we operate under the, the IITF follows the IETF, IPR guidelines. So in essence, this means if you contribute something or you hear something that is related to IPR you are expected to notify us in a in a short time. Okay. Thank you. There's also the privacy and, code of conduct, that we operate under, So if we, if this is new to you, to you, please, read these documents carefully And, Then, our usual reminder So this is the internet research task force. We are not setting standards for the internet. We are doing research. And, so this gets sometimes, mixed up because we are using, the, say, RSC publication stream.

It's not my job to try and finger and prod the firewall. I'm sorry. This is not my job. So, you know, however it behaves is, however it behaves, and that's just the way it is.

And, The result was actually a deregulation. Of that private company's monopoly in the US. And the theory, the economic theory at the time, was that competition In amongst providers, would get rid of that rich profitability and create value for consumers. And The resultant regulatory regime was not intended to curb behaviors how telephone operators operated. It was intended to protect consumers from market dominance and market distortion. And in some ways, it was peculiarly American, But oddly enough, there was a lot of pressure placed on every other developed economy to similarly deregulate their telephone system. And and What happened was didn't create more telephone companies because A telephone company is a massive investment, And unless you have a few hundred million people, you can only ever support 1, competition came in the form of alternate systems, including the internet, Now the incident grew out of a complete absence of regulation.

You were it was it was a crime to plug anything into the network. That wasn't bought from them. And that freedom to choose customer premises equipment I think helped significantly in the development of what became The Internet. The European situation was slightly different because in there, we had state owned post and telecom operators that were privatized and privatization counter intuitively, creates increased regulation to enable new market entrants and to enable competition. Does this have to do with fragmentation? I want to come back and agree with what I think you may have said. Forgive me if I mischaracterize this. But, I'm interpreting it as The type of fragmentation that most significantly must be avoided at all costs. Is what you've described as technical fragmentation, And I would collapse that even further down to the loss of a single name and addressing space. See If we lose a single name in the dressing space, to me, That's game over.

So if you enter information into one of those applications that's needed in the other one. You'll just have to re enter that information. Whereas if you look Colorado, you can get it all 5 of these social services online and 4 of them are coordinated. In other words, there is a commonality between the out once you're in and you've started to enter information like your ID and your Social Security number and other information. That's now in the application, and it can it can coordinate Now there there are a couple of ways that you can start to simplify this model One would be to centralize a lot of this information to stop to coordinate as you can imagine, Colorado has sort of centralized this information and carries it between these applications. The other way would be to say, let's create a decentralized infrastructure share, in which an applicant can enter a large amount of information that is private to them. And when they make an application for one of these services, there is an API that is able to, stacked for that information. From that individual's data store. And that that information does not need to be kept. By the the state, because they know that that on request, they can get that information.

It would be checked off that you had shown those documents and that you identified yourself and the information was there. So this is this is a way of sort of shifting away from an idea of centralization of data, and that has huge benefits in a number of ways. Not least of which is that the services don't actually need to be coordinated. And I I use this these five services as an example, I'll give some other examples a much smaller and simpler services that you'd wanna be able to get municipal services as well as social services you wanna be able to get that are very unlikely ever to be coordinated and it's a good thing that they don't need to be coordinated partly for privacy reasons. But also for for, from the perspective of how they're managed. And, you know, you can imagine that somebody who has collected a large amount of information. They lived in Nebraska.

So we've been working, on a a solution we call a personal access system for services that that builds, a decentralized infrastructure that allows individuals and, companies and services to interact, where all the information is available through the two pods that are that are being brought together, the personal online data stores that are being brought together and no other interaction is required.

Small transactions like that all the way up to large transactions, potentially things like purchasing a home. Could be done with with, validated document in a pod that then is a is a transaction infrastructure. And so you end up sort of pushing all of the data to the edge and then having, a series of applications and APIs that can find the data that's necessary quite quickly. And and complete a transaction. So personal access system for services has been started. It's it's in a very, minor form at the moment. We are using it, for a very particular purpose you can find.

Is there like one PKI system for that, or how can we imagine that So we're, they're there are a number of standards that we are attaching on, but we're still sort of fracting this. So, the, there's a lot of discussion about whether we should use part to part, encryption Depending on how you're using this system, here. one way to provide, a number of different security of search. So there are a number of ways to talk about security. One is can you be where there's the person you're sharing information with. Another is do I need to protect the information that's being transmitted? One way to do this would be to, to provide, publicprivate key infrastructure that would, that would assure you that the individuals are who they say they are. In other words, that that there's a unique private key, and and you can exchange transactions to ensure that that person is who they say they are"

And we don't intend to use it in all transactions, but clearly, you stop through transactions that have real privacy needs and real financial impacts, that kind of infrastructure is gonna be necessary. So we have the capability of doing that. The the yes. I I think that's That's probably the the simplest way to describe it, but we are interested in talking working with people. Might have simpler mechanisms here. It would mean managing a large number of keys. Because you're you're you don't you you don't wanna use the public private key for the document. So you're you're keeping management of keys that you've encrypted for individuals. There are a number of of really interesting ways to use those keys.

And what we are doing is we are pulling, and then we are leveraged identifiers from To this Internet, So for example, if you have email addresses, just use email addresses of as the identifier, that is unique, verifiable, because you can you can challenge with email cell verification code, and this is definitely is method meaningful. You can see that my colleague from UCLA, CS department, and we can also use some other identifiers if email is not the most suitable case. Example, if I can even I can use my GitHub account as identifier, but this this is already unique because my username on GitHub has to be with Hindi. GitHub domain, and this is verifiable because GitHub has hit its own verification. Oh, this verification workflow And, of course, this is Somatic are meaningful.

But, on the back end, we want to change this document into multiple changes. Here, each change is, email to update a packet and it has a single producer, which means it's written by a single author and there's a system in the storage and actual change is propagated in the network The reason why the 2 days is first is, document always in some kind of dynamic state, so we want something immutable that easily handled by the network, and also you can Securly tracking who did reach part of a change by met the ultrasound and also this gives us the ability of sync apps, the document, because when two when two people gets exactly the same set of changes, then that means we can, reassemble the same version of the document.

So Sheniel already talked about how we generate and assign the data, but One key aspect of building a decentralized application is that we cannot do what's on the left we we cannot have one centralized server even a cluster of centralized centrally controlled servers that that actually help our users exchange their data. And so we need to do this rendezvous, which is 2, users meeting each other, exchanging the data. It has to happen inside the work. Application to be truly decentralized. And for that, we use an NDA network, which is exactly what it is designed for to let to let the users directly exchange their data without essential server. Next slide, please. And So, to actually have a concrete running implementation of India Network. We use the Indian test, but which is, a global network, running Indian software. It's spread across four continents. There are 22 notes that are contributed by universities Institutes It's basically a actual Indian network that anyone can use. And you can also join. If you if you have a note, then anyone can join. It's something like, the early stages of the internet. So we use this Indian open Indian network to exchange data between the users of test bed, live in the use of the workspace. So whenever a user connects, like opens a workspace, they connect to the nearest test lead router, and, other users will connect to their closest routers"

The key difference that this, model has from a traditional centralized server is that the Indian network or the test bed in this case does not understand or see the data. At all. So the data can be encrypted as long as it is named in a way that the test that can forward it to whoever Once the data, it it is just infrastructure. The test, but it's just like infrastructure. It's not specific to the application either. Next slide, please. So the so the next one, once we have the test bed, we have Indian network, we can actually exchange the data But in Indian, to to fetch your data, you first need to know what the data is and as it is need to tell everyone as it is produced. So in this example, if Alice produces a new piece of beta, Alice needs to tell everyone this is a new piece of data. So this is kind of different from a traditional IP where where Alice will just push the data to everyone else, but we can do that in a disputed application because not everyone might want the data. Example, in this case, Bob wants the data, Cathy does not. And then there's also the case that there's a participant who does not hear Alice's message. And so we have this for example, they might be offline, and then we need loss recovery. Next slide, please. And to achieve this, we use synchronization. Sync is NDS transport layer here. It's it's short for distributed data synchronization. And essentially sync, synchronizes the set of produce data names among all the participants in a group. Using Indian infrastructure. So that way it is centralized does not require central server to let everyone know what the state of the group is. And the status essentially just how many different pieces of data are produced by each producer, part of the group, which we call the sync group, and what are the names of this data? So as soon as we synchronize this information, then anyone if Bob's want a piece of data from Alice, they can use this to use the name,"

And in particular, for workspace implementation, we use a state vector sync protocol And, these slides have links to the specification as well as the implementation for the SBS protocol. Next slide, please. And the way we use it is we, you use Indian sync to synchronize CRDT updates. So each update that that would make the document, any anything any change that would make to the document, is, encoded as a CRD Delta, then we take this delta and then we put it, make it into an Indian packet secure the packet, and use NDS thing to synchronize this data to all the participants that are inside this group. That are actually editing this particular document. And, so to subscribe to the these changes, we would through the process of joining the sync group, which is essentially telling the network that you are interested in this data and then would actually bring that data to you, and it would do that reliably. Yeah. Also considering the case that if you go offline, then you'll be getting these changes after you come back online. But that's actually linked to my next point, which is that all the users may not be online simultaneously. So if you just consider pure infrastructure, just a network. And then there are users connected to this with a d this decentralized distributed application, then If all the users go on offline after making, some changes to the document, and someone else comes some other user who does not CD exchanges comes online. They can't actually get these changes from anyone because nobody's online. And, because to solve this, we need, to have asynchronous communication, we need, generic in storage in in network storage, which will store these updates for when someone else comes online. Next slide, please. And so we call this, in network data storage as a repo. And once again, this is also infrastructure. It does not see your data does not understand your data."

So you don't TLS to the report, anything like that. The data is secured independently. And as long as the data is available in the network, That's the only function that the repo is providing. Can dispatch the data and independently use it. In the application. Next slide. Back to Danielle. Yeah. So, if we want to make some a summary of this our current effort. I I think the biggest thing. Number one thing is that with take the smack the user and then it fires from this Internet. I think that's the biggest difference our between our effort and some previous efforts, say, some collaborative dashboard or collaborative text editing app that is we would use a way we really take that entire to this Internet and try to apply that to build user centric, data centric security. Once we once the user obtained their identifier, then they can and others can verify their identifier ownership we can use that identifier secure the head directly by sending and do end to end encryption. And if the data are named, data is a mathematical name and key last method name as well. Then we only need a we only need a network that can exchange those secret data is is it does not matter if this communication media is local, say, ip multicast what we call in the end, that's where we call any any sort of network by by a mash of WebRTC those things can be used to exchange secure data And the I would I would say this had a design idea of having the having the data centric security with user identifier"

Just used 1 week to start coding, issue the pre requests, and we get code code emerged. Only thing he needs to do is own a a little bit of Yjs, 30 driver knowledge and the a bit of a bit of front of work because he has to put the chat in the chat in the box. Right?

So, there, there actually is security built in to get gloves, but you still have to that over a connection oriented protocol that I give you. Okay, question for me. So the reason why, such systems today are typically implemented in a centralized fashion is, as far as I can see, the security bootstrapping that we just discussed. Then, consistency management for, like, parallel, edits. And also scalability concerns. So CRT, I mean, it's it's not a silver bullet that solves all all your consistency issues.

Centralization. So to be a CBA GMlex Plan Institute for informatics, and I would to pick up that point of what an email pushes centralization and in the email protocols pushes centralization. And the first and foremost thing is complexity. And this complexity is being enforced by centralization of email platforms. So Google can make certain claims as to how an email has to look when it's being submitted. We do have 2 enhancement protocols. We have Dane at MTSTS. And the ASTS has mostly been pushed by people who like, well, be an asset maybe not while Dane classically is pushed by people who say, like, TSsec. We like that. So, when you now have large centralization, maybe one of the operators might fall into one of the camp. And then they might say like, well, if we want to send email to you, you have to do MTS. Yes. Of a sudden, people have to figure out how to do MTSTS. So this this growing complexity and growing complexity of operating a standard compliant mail setup in conjunction with large operators having the ability to say like, okay, Then we just now take your mail. That is what is pushing centralization because in the end users want emails just to arrive and being red and well, receive emails.

I mean, say, kind of say, okay, there are, are, say, good reasons to, to centralize so a certain infrastructure elements, simplicity simplicity, is one reason.

I think we need to understand the say, socioeconomic, say realities and then the the threats that stem from there. So things that, Wes mentioned, in the beginning, So just asking what to decentralists next is maybe, not the best question to ask. My my view. So We deregulated. We opened this up to what we'd call market forces. The underlying drivers here are not RFCs or standards. The underlying drivers, is investment. Now, In one of the more telling documents, I think that ever appeared. It was a Wall Street Journal article by Peter Theal. Of the guys behind PayPal, And he said competitions for losers.

Meta, Facebook did not intend to make a competitive application. They intended to make a complete and comprehensive environment that basically resisted any form of competitive entry. Kindle the same, etcetera, etcetera. And so when you go, well, how should we decentralize? The answer is Last I heard you weren't a venture capitalist. Last I heard you weren't funding development in this industry. Good luck, but if you're not doing that, You have very little impact that because we de you know, deregulated, because we started to open this up into the tyranny of economics. You start opening this up into an issue where size matters. Volumes matter. Capturing users matters. And everything you're decrying about centralization is a logical outcome of the investment model silicon Valley took up because there was no other model around and the money had an agenda. And so in many ways, I find marks, observations in this RFC I can sympathize with what he's trying to say But the amateur economist in my head says its anti gravity, He wasn't on the other side of the fence.

And, I mean, a couple of people already mentioned how how we got this, but I think the IDF, as a responsibility in decentralization of of email. And and it's also an example because it happens in other sectors because simply by, by increasing the complexity of the protocol I think more and more and more things on top of the original services, it made the self hosting email in general. I mean, it it makes it very difficult for services to be hosted by anyone who is not very big company. And there are more protocols in the making that either rely on, like, a centralized, trust list like ARC, you'll see. Or, or, I mean, even protocols like Ohio, have a, basically, a component that makes it unlikely that they will never be deployed at a scale by anyone but 3, 4, 5, very big So so this is because I I want to get to them into the question of how can we stop this? And I don't want to be disrespectful or offensive to the people.

And most of the people that participated here work for the companies that on centralization and are pushing more centralization. So it's really hard to imagine that the IETF can can do a lot in this field. Especially given that in many cases, it's not that there are not the protocols. It's the deployment of the protocols that is made in a way that centralized everything. So to me, I mean, I've in the last few years, I've come to the conclusion that the only I have is governmental intervention. Is what we've been trying to get in Europe, and we'll see whether it works. At least this is the first time we we get, for example, me, that will open up WhatsApp and able to accept other app stores in iOS. And so, I mean, there are that are happening, and they are only happening because the European Union has started to make regulation out they would not have happened.

And I think in the EU, now we have a few examples where this happened already, For example, the digital market apps that kind of opened up the app store And this opens up to a separate question. With these regulations, for example, in Europe now, you have a let's say, different apps or experience, whether in Europe or you are somewhere else. Or with GDPR, sometimes we have some websites that are not from Europe that they block users from Europe because don't want to have to even deal with GDPR. And so question that I don't see on the slide is how does this centralization or decentralization then affect fragmentation of platforms and so on.

So I think that's a force for, centralization as one of many examples I that you could make a reasonable argument that, the, the push on anti fragmentation of internet is arguably, you could reframe that as a disguised way of, advocating for centralization. Just put that out there as you might wanna look at who's backing that overall program.
