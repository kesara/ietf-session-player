We only have three presentations. So, Italo will first lead the discussion of a young data model for network inventory and then followed by Boru to present the network inventory software extensions and inventory topology young modules. And then I think the last presentation, Camillo will law the discussion of the asset life cycle management and operations, which includes the problem statement and the young data model So I think we have a fair amount of time available this time for sufficient discussion.

Once again if you feel the need to have weekly calls by week calls, whatever, to speed up, your work, make it easier feel free to ask and we will accommodate it Then we have a second draft now, which is in the adoption call we made the mistake to call for the adoption very close to the IETF meeting which is extremely busy people to apply their slides, do the last changes to their drive so if the number of replies will not be, will not reflect the number of actions, participants in the working group, we will have the next week to 12 people more time for review But so far, I've seen quite many"

Just an quick update on liaisons We don't have any incoming liaison since the last time meeting, but we have an outgoing one, which is a response to the bbf liaison that we received before the meeting in Brisbane basically where they shared with us the fact that they started working on a new topic on the network resource model in which they were asking us some questions and we provided a formal feedback in the shape of, a liaison. If you remember, this is a something that was sent on the mainland a formal feedback in the shape of a liaison. If you remember, this is something that was sent on the main list to get feedback from the entire working group This is it.

I try to categorize this open issue into two groups so see if we can speed up the complete of the first phase of the base model. So some issues are really blocking. I don't think we can progress to work group plus call without closing them other issue maybe are not really blocking if people want to have a phased approach, we can deliver a first version of the model and then do an update of the model the model so that's the class categorization so what is blocked is definitely how we model port and back out because i don't think we can have a base model without this more this solution supported We have some discussion about terminology and scope we would like to make sure that what we do in the base model is not blocking the ALMO progress. So everything that ALMO needs from the base model should be covered and then we need to clean up a little bit the editorial to make the quality of the document ready for a working group plus code there are other issues that maybe can be addressed other by documents which arguments the Bay model or by BIS of the RSC without any major issue. So if you want to address, to add the new attributes or new inventory elements with a discussion about reports the links, this could be, we can be done after the first round or right operations can be done added later on so we can discuss whether we want to have a first version which everything is resolved only and then discuss what can be read right because from rid-only read-write is a backward-compatible change on us don't see any major issue to do later and there was a also a proposal about the Pirmount approach.

And there are no standard references So it means that we have to look around on what you will see that around in the presentation of what I'm doing to understand to describe the use cases typically thinking a picture somewhere on the web trying to use web from no major vendors, so there is no advertising And then we have three solutions at least. People are split to toward three solutions. So both of the, all the three are based on existing models some are trying to reuse as much as possible at a city 48. Some are more aligned with the config some are more aligned with o nftapi and we are analyzing these options the details of all these three options are still not fully and understood, so there are still some discussion and investigation plus the terminology is a mess. Every time we try there are terms which are used in the different terms that are used in different use cases in different documents to represent the same thing, sometimes the same, the same term is used to represent different things. Transceiver and channel are two examples. The transceiver is sometimes represented the module that you plug in the in there in the in a card and matter transceiver is also functional as element which is a pair of transmitter and optical receiver and you can see that sometimes in the transferable or you have more than one transceivers component so that's and Chaness I I open config uses for example channel for OS channel, line channel, and I, I, I spend it list a couple of days until somebody clarified"

OK, next slide, please OK, just to write down a bit the scenario that we are considering we are considered basically three four cases of ports what we can call non-plagable integrative ports is a port which is in the front panel of a border we can have an empty all so where you can plug in a module, a SFP, a transit is a port which is in the front panel of a border. We can have an empty all, so where you can plug in a module, an SFP, a so-called transceiver, or I will use, I use the term sfp module here and which has a port, and the third, the third case is where you have a this all with the with a with a with a with a with a with a with the plugin in SFP and the first case is where this module is somehow integrated into the board so the difference between one and four is blurred but we said okay let's focus on the first three. Once the first three are clear, I think, the number four may be straightforward And another misperception I noticed is that sometimes people tend to associate one with electrical and two and three with optical, but we are found solution where there is an RJ45 plugable transceivers. So at the end, maybe the model should be the same, no matter whether the port is optical or electrical and we had some discussion. And from the main list, the feedback was at people want to understand also how they break out ports are more than before we can take a decision about how to progress. Next slide please Okay, we had some discussion about Connectors So here is just, as you can see, examples of connectors the rj45 connector is as well known to the word but you can see that when you go into the details the RJ4 is one connector with multiple pins where every pin is using transmission and receive direction Where we have what is called I read many definitions in the world, in the web call it simplest optical connector is a connection which contains only one pin, so you have only one file"

    "text": "and that in this fiber you can send traffic into TXRX or there are situations where you have a B-directional communication over the same fiber or what that people call duplex optical connector in this case is a is one connector with two pins so you you apply it a same fiber or what that people call duplex optical connector in this case is a is one connector with two pins so you you plug and plug all the pins at the same time you don't you cannot plug pins independently and you have one pin for the TX and one pin for X. And we have the case of the MP Optica connector, which is very independently and you have one one pin for the tx and one pin it for x and we have the case of the ampio optical connector which is multi which is very similar to rj45 if you if you see it multiple pins and each pin can carry traffic in it for the X. And we have the case of the MP Optical Connector, which is very similar to RJ45, if you see. In multipone pins, and each pin can carry traffic in the ATX or in our X direction. Next slide Okay, this is just to show the example of an RJ45 you can see there are electric there are a sort of transceiver where you transmit and receive electrical signal, you have multiple pins and the connector can be either integrated on the board or can be pluggable on the on a transceiver next slide. The optic then we have what we can call as a use case and a single channel optical port where that's where you can see here it took me quite a while you have on the left yes you have four electrical channels which are calling no NOPE config host channels and on the right you have a two of optical channels which are lines sign channels So I have only one single lambda in the TX and the other which goes over two fibers paired on on the duplice connector next slide And you have only one interface, one, let me say connector, X, all. Then a separate case is when it is opt next slide. Okay, this is a case where you have a sort of multi-channel, but the here you can see there are eight host interfaces, four line interfaces, four landas, and the different optical seniors are multiplexed over two fibers using WDM And there are use cases where these type of configuration is used to confuse"

And then you put them together using an MPO port so you have a four pairs of fiber which go over the same cable And you have only one connector where you plug and plug all the fibers and then the connect you can see is an MPO port and typically the use case I've seen is that the association between the channel and the TX and RX pins on the MPO is fixed it's not confirmed it's not something flexible and again here we can have, sometimes you can use this for channel to carry for example one 400 gigabiton interface or you can carry four different hundred gigabit interfaces that can go to the same peer or two different peers next slide okay these are about the fact that there are new use cases. The first one, we was mentioned at the end of the last call, so we have not analyzed. The second one I found it on the Google when I was preparing these slides and looking for some years at the end of the last call, so we have not analyzed. The second one I found it on the Google when I was preparing these slides and looking for some figures. And these two use cases are slightly different than the one we are different And we have also to consider those use cases to make sure that our model is complete Next slide. It's just to give any of that. Okay So now we can go into more details about what are the different options that we are analyzing and what are the gaps that we have identified and the points that requires more clarification to address the use cases that we have considered so far and none of the gaps for every options I don't see any real roadblock so if there is a gap, it can be easily addressed"

So the first one is using the 80s like approach in this case we represent the whole, we start with the case where we have a plugable port. The whole is represented as a container component, which is a child component of the board component and the relative position is number two because if you go back to the initial slide it's the second hole on the port. And then under this parent component we can put a port component which is it is the only port in the container we can say it's only position number one we don't see we don't have any association between the interface and the port and again this is a gap that can be easily addressed, but it's a gap We don't know how to, there is no solution to the ATT4TA, I think, was developed earlier. So there is no indication about how to model the breakouts and we have a doubt it was I sent an email to the list a few weeks ago how do we name if you there is a common convention especially in optical network to name the location of the elements, of the ports with this thing, any slots, sub-slot port. It is port is a port number three into the slot 10, or is the port 1 into sub-slot 2 of port 10? my understanding is that the common practice is different one but that is the port number three, but there is not easy to derive this string from the information that you have been younger While in the other case, you can see that quite derive this string from the information that you have in younger while in the other case you can see that can be straightforward we have a doubt whether to mode or not the connector type and also the models, the attribute, there are no specific models, so we don't know whether the attribute of the SFP models should be go And we have also some discussion where we need this last because some people like me think that the model it will be will be a port component under the container component other people told me no no it should be a content component which contains a"

But when I read the definition, in the 8348, I have to admit that I cannot say I was wrong but i cannot say i was wrong the definition of port and modules both are compatible with both interpretations. So it's not very clear In that scenario, whether under the container component, we have to put a module and then a port or just a port what the only doubt is that if you model the SP has a module, what is the port then? representing? That's my doubt. Next slide, please okay the second approach is the open config approach. In this case, the idea is that under the port the board component we have a port component. And since the port represents both the integrative port as well as the whole where you can plug in the SFP the the installed position of the port component will be number three We perfectly fit with a string that is common practice today. And then the port component will be have a transceiver component which contains the list of channels, and then there are references from the interface to the port the port and to this one or more channels in the transceiver component. The list of the channel is the list of the line channels. You remember the use case before? We have eight host channel and four line channels. So you reference which one of the four line channels for example in the r four are associated with a given interface so if you have a breakout you can say my interface number one is using channel one. Interface number two is using channel two and three. So you can easily model the breakouts and then you configure the two is using Channel 2 and 3. So you can easily model the breakouts, and then you configure, but this association is really, the configuration is driven by the"

Next slide please OK Okay. Okay, then we said that, okay, if the port is a single interface, so there is no breakout, you can just reference the port and you don't need to reference all the channels under the port. We will make simple to like RJ45, where people don't list it's one port even if it is a multi multi connector. It's not very clear because the open config is very optical, whether this model applies or not to electrical interfaces electrical ports so we need to figure out what is missing and also there are some corner cases, for example, SR4 where you can have a multiple connect That one from advertising of MPO that's advantage of the API. We don't have to have four fibers. You can use one cable. In this case, you need to associate the interface with multiple ports. We don't open confit you cannot do because the interface the reference is two or the single port But again, we have to create a new model making a list it doesn't it doesn't it's not a big deal next slide please okay the third up approach is tapy and tapy uh It doesn't. It doesn't. It's not a big deal. Next slide, please. Okay, the third approach is TAPI. In TAPI, we have some discussion. It seems that TAPI supports the breakout for mPO the breakout with wdm is not very clear if it is in the in the inventory model it seems to me it's more on the in the functional element, in the functional model So it's not covered, but I didn't have time to follow out with Nigel on this. And tapy what you have, you have, you model, it seems to me is more on the in the functional element, in the functional model. So it's not covered, but I didn't have time to follow out with Nigel on this. And tapy what you have, you have that you have an older, which is under a board which is an equipment and the equipment as a list of what are the holders. And the older has a name which is a string. So this attribute exists"

The, in tap older, there is an equipment type, which is an SFP, which is located, which is plug it in in this in this order. The in TAPE model, there is no information about what are the what are the connectors what are the pin but it's just implicit in the model, but it's assumed that you know so what you do they create they create an access portal which is basically an entity which is doing the bridge so the asset port is basically providing a reference to what are the connectors and the pins in one or multiple equipment. So you can have a connectors on different boards that are all together representing the same as sport and then the no dash point which is similar to interface as a reference to the assessment all together representing the same as a port. And then the no dash point, which is similar to interface, as a reference to the aspect. So there is a flexible association between the logical entity which is not the interface, and the hardware entities, which are the connectors and pins. Next slide, please okay the association to the pins is only needed it can be done everywhere, but it's required only if you have break If you don't have breakout, you can associate directly and assigns port with a connector. And okay that's and then it's not very clear as I said before, how you made the breakout with WDM assuming to find and investigate this option next slide please okay then based on what we discuss, how do we model the whole one is empty? okay if you follow 8348 we will have a part a"

It will be important number in position number two so that that you can easily derive the location from the position number two. And the empty is telling you that there is nothing inside the port. So the port is empty the plug-up port is empty next slide Fourth up is nothing inside the the port so the port is empty the plug-up port is empty next slide for TAPI is the same you will have this whole is a whole name. You write, you have to, to a explicitly report the string in the in the model and then there is no key maintenance inside this all and which is using this holder and then you can understand this is empty next slide okay about the non-plugable port okay for 8348 we assume that it is a port component, which is directly under the border And then since it is a position number one, in this case, you can derive the string And there is the same gap as before. So in this case, you don't have a container because there is no it's not plugable next slide In case of open config is simple to the other case where it was plugable the only difference is that the transceiver component as an ff u flag which is force so the frU flag is false means that the transceiver component is pluggable, the only difference is that the transceiver component has an FRU flag which is false. So the FRU flag is false means that the transceiver component and the port are all integrated into the board There is no pluggable component you can plug in plug out.

Keep it so it's capable of being simple, so people might want to use this if all they're doing is like DSIM type activity and they don't need the optical have that as an ability but keep it simple I don't know what the right answer is, but the open config kind of look like it to me i it simple. I don't know what the right answer is, but the open config kind of look like it to me. I fully agree with you to make it simple. The problem is the end and the breakout that is making because without them that's what I'm also trying, I'm pushing a little bit during a discussion If you have an MPO cable, like RJ, for it's an MPO type like but it's a single interface a single component single port you can measure as a single entity. When you have a break that's where the complexity increases because then you have multiple interfaces. So you need to understand which interfaces goes where and that's where things become more complex and maybe this is a Ciscoism but like when I plug in a breakout, I get like four different ports. And yes, I need to know that that's a breakout cable, but then I have maybe logical interfaces on top of that physical port that I care about. So all I need to know is I have a breakout connector here and from a physical inventory standpoint, I don't care as much, maybe I don't care as much beyond that Logically, I do because now I have four interfaces Okay, so your point is that the breakout model should be locked to the logical view and not to the inventory That's that's a good input.

I think there are several variations.

I first will apologize because I think I opened that kind of warrants of breakouts. I really apologize No, it's OK. We really need it. Yes, exactly I will give you an example. For Nokia and Juno's, you do need to know that a port is breakout because you need to continue it before. Maybe not for Cisco, but for the for the you an example. For Nokia and Juno's, you do need to know that a port is breakout because you need to configure it before. Maybe not for Cisco, but for those you need it. So it is part somehow of the inventory though. We need to know it I let you guys discuss where, but we just need to know it So first, this is a lot of work.

Thank you very much. It's a lot of work it's also I'm also struggling to understand what's the best option And one option is to follow what John was suggested is to say the breakout is something in the logical domain So from a physical perspective, from the inventor perspective, we both care is we don't see the breakout. I have only a couple of comments on both Mahesh and John joe uh the these these use cases are driven by the optical technology but are applicable also to IP routers and that actually most what i know is more the breakout is more useful on routers than on the optical devices And the second comment I don't remember now. OK the breakout is more used on the routers than on the optical devices and the second comment I don't remember no okay I don't remember okay I will you will jump back I think I'm up next So I've got a few comments here. So before I was doing network manageability, I implemented the breakout stuff on iOSXR. So I have some experience here one of the comments I've got a few comments going through the difference between module and ports in our example was that we had cases where you could have like modular cards that would be plugged in. And within those modular cards, they would have modular ports and things. So I would definitely keep the ports to being the the plugable optics that equivalent, and the module is something higher than that if you want to have it That's what I would do I thought your presentation was very good. I didn't understand your naming example where it went from like three down to two. I understood the ones where you have. Okay, can you go back to the initial slides? I think Daniel will need to do that. Okay, yeah the one at the beginning. Yeah. So I understand the ones these ones why i understand that's this one yeah"

Yeah okay you see the if you count the ports the first one is one, the second is due, the third three, the four is four. Yeah, but if you look at the whole, the the first hole is the whole number one is port number two The whole number two is port number three So if I model the hole as a container, the position of the hole in the board is one and two If I model the all as a port, then the number of the port is two and 3. So for me, I think you need to, the number needs to be that when you come somebody walks up to the line car physically and count like the physical integrated ports and the whole that it's just numbered probably in a little number sequence and so the one we split it out further, that was confusing to me I didn't, again, on the slide, I didn't, I don't really understand the distinction between one and four, which you mentioned So I would think they're probably the same. In terms of how you, model this the tapy one looks complicated to me, and I don't know Tappy, whereas I got a lot more feeling, with like open config approach and uh other one, effectively so. I think that those that ones would be more natural as what I would expect and I'd like to say that there is I think a benefit within the industry if we can align with open config not use their models but have the same structures where possible because implementations at the moment, they're all implementing open config so for these devices, and we want to get IETF models to get traction then it helps if they're easier to implement this less friction between the two so i would make that recommendation um and i think there's a common about whether you should see breakout in the inventory I think it probably should be there at some level You want to know that you've got a breakout.

The second comment I was forgetting The breakout cable is hard to know from the key mentor because I have an MPO I have an MPO con little bit in here, maybe. Oh, you're jumping in my mind. The second comment I was forgetting. The breakout cable is hard to know from the key mentor. Because I have an MPO connector. I may have a breakout interface, but I cannot know whether the cable attached to the connector is breaking up. So the different interfaces are going to different peers or is not breaking out And so all the interfaces are going to the same peer I don't know. From any human perspective, I don't, I don't have information about that. So we have our so all the interfaces are going to the same pier. I don't know from any human perspective. I don't have information about that. So we have also an open, an open discussion about modeling the cables Then you can see the cable as a breakout But when I look at the equipment, the configuration, I cannot I can tell whether the inter, the port is breaking out into multiple interfaces but I cannot tell whether the cable attached to that MPO port is blacked out in multiple, toward multiple lens Because the cable doesn't give you any information, it's passive. Yes, exactly And so if you wanted to model the cables there, that it's going to be through configuration and you don't know whether it's actually right. Yeah, and we, yeah Because the cable doesn't give you any information, it's passive. Yes, exactly. And so if you wanted to model the cables there, that it's going to be through configuration, and you don't know whether it's actually right. So it's slightly different. I think that was, oh, and the last thing, I agreed with both Mahesh and Joe in terms of trying to keep it simple so i prefer solutions where where you've got a box with like number, like ports number one. Those don't have extra layers in if they're not required. I'd like those to be models simply. And when you've got the ones where it's plugable, you create the extra structure. So it's not the same everywhere That's what I would do.

And from that point of view, the open config one seems to be the simplest to me But this is part of the contribution comments it is open config is also extremely widely deployed so you are saving some effort to the SDN benders in translation between one model and the other so my suggestion would be to go for that. Speaking about the simplicity, I spoke with different people not just in these days, but in the last in the last months.

But in the mean, we manage to progress a document that covers 80 85% of a use cases out there is not perfect, but it's usable and can be the deployed. So this is my suggestion These also, so again, back to the network model so we expect to have this model on the NBI of packet contract and optical controllers In many cases, they are different controllers because the industry is going towards their hierarchical approach with an IP controller for the IP network and the optical controller for the optical network so just sharing a loud thought here nothing more than that. Would it make sense to split the model between a packet model and the optical model? I'm not sure about that. It's just a loud thinking so take it take it as is that's it from my second.

Open configs modeling the router so there you see the hierarchy of components, you see the line card in the line card you have a port and on the port you have the transceiver well this is just because when you read the documentation on the web, you will see people calling it a pluggable port and you can see the one two three four idea that I was mentioned before written sometimes in the front panel of the art hardware component of the board You're right because there is not that now we are mixing right because there is not that now we are because now we are mixing the concept of what what does the port mean and what does the the whole mean so and i've seen other implementations that what they did is the create an intermediate component they call a slot and as in open config you are free I mean you have a little common you can do whatever you like and put the hierarchy that you like so they put uh they put these intermediate components because it helps.

Yes, it's a pluggable port as it's empty that's that I mean as I said that's one of the view of those who wants to more that they always a port.

Thank you, Othello, for the nice thorough survey of all the existing models One that I didn't see you mention was the SNMP entity MIP, which is like 20 years ago And I mentioned this because it was around back then 15 years or so, when I was at Jennifer, I did this kind of thing, and I used it as inspiration because there was nothing else to go off of. And then if you want to bike shed a little bit more, they use the word enclosure, I believe, is the not whole report. But it was and also we did model the cables But the thing is he model the cable it's like a physical device it's like it is like you model like a device, not like a link, but then in your topology model you have to link it. So the one side of the cable has a one link and the other side of the cable for breakout and there's individual links and they all have to be linked to the other side ports. So thank you.

So what you have is, well, those holes proposed by Oscar. And then having some kind of changes of the status that you can have there which is very much like the same approach that we're trying to follow when we're talking about the features and the entitlements in Almo. I'm not doing the same we're using the same names, but probably trying to follow a similar pattern. Because that put a lot if in the future somebody comes with, I don't know think about quantum connections that can be in very strange states of how a three pins instead of two because one is of the entanglement maintenance or whatever, Buddha law was to consider this without completely changing the schema just i mean i know it's very philosophical it's not anything concrete, but it's about thinking about that and probably we could agree in certain design patterns for this and for the future.

So you will see a pause under the board, no matter whether it is pluggable or not plugable, and then to have another parallel model where you represent the capability because when when look at this board, you have to say that there are four for roles, for example, but this the fact that there are four holes is not because you have this board is not number 10. It's because the board is of type X So all the instances of this board, of this type of board will have the same set of caparides. So the idea was to have a capability model where you describe the, but type X. So all the instances of this board, of this type of board will have the same set of capabilities. So the idea was to have a capability model where you describe the left, but let's go back to the discussion of the idea that will make the capability model is not trivial. No, no, no, no of capabilities so the idea was to have a capability model where you describe the left but let's go back to the discussion of the near that will make the capability model is not trivial anyhow no no no for sure for sure we are suffering it. Exactly. So then the idea was that we don't report the holes, we just report the components There are no more container, there is no more holder. You just report the, there is a port in number one and which is not plugable in number two you don't know that there is an empty hole in-door two from the invention You know from the capability. And then in port three, you see there is a port which is plug plug-able and is there that was one option but we said that's that we make a dependence from the whole model from the capability model and seems to be to long path. So yeah, yeah, no, here is probably would be something in the in between In between, yeah. I believe that this is what we are trying to we should have to have a look at the I mean from both sides, to the Alma models and to these to try to, let me say, and to try to share the style, not necessarily the, same the pattern, yeah, and that think take your comment.

So separation of loads and physical is critical, but purely thinking about physical is something that can be measured with a ruler not anything else. So if we can measure it with a ruler, then it's physical if you can't it isn't and I think if we can do that that's that's what we're trying to do and we've done in TAPI, and I think most of the other interventions have done to some degree, models have done to some degree The plugable is an equipment as was mentioned earlier, it has a serial number and a tight and you have it in a spares holding and so on, so it really ought to be modeled in the same way as any other equipment Essentially, the thing the plug-able goes in, as a whole. So we had this in TM4 and we had this solids and spaces concept where a space is a whole of any size, as a matter whether it's small or bigger anything else. So trying to get that uniform I think just helps ongoing if you then have plugs in plagues in, plagues or something silly about that, or deeper equipments and so on, line drawers and old-fashioned things like that You can nest the physical things nicely into holes, but I do agree very much with the point that the representation of the holder, if your point you were making just now, is very much of a capability statement. You don't really need it instance of it if you've got the capability model. If you haven't got a model of capability, then you end up needing instances representing holes and holders and, you know, we call them, because you've got no other way of no knowing it. So I think it really comes down to whether we can do a capability model to then allow a slots, we want to call them, because you've got no other way of knowing it. So I think it really comes down to whether we can do a capability model to then allow us to ignore the holes and holes in the live instance model or not If we don't have it, I think we need that representation still At this one point on this split, the pins are only rather than"

It's just knowing there's a single connector on a the plug is maybe all you need But if they split, then you may need to know which pin the cables on because you may have some issue with the optics from that pin. As it will have said earlier this stuff is technology independent, so it could be an electrical cable, an optical cable it could be in a packet device that's got no optics in, et cetera, it could be in anything It could be some bus for some of the purpose, trying to get a model that actually represents that physical environment consistently independent of the technology of the system. So I try and to split the supporting Oscar's point, try not to split the model so you have a physical model for applied for optical and a separate physical model or consideration for a packet or something else. It doesn't seem to make sense really when you get down to it, especially if we do the strong physical, it's something measurable with a ruler, then, you know, it doesn't you can have any old implementation on it So the pins are in your realm when it splits and just back on that simplicity um just on the TAPE model, it actually is quite simple if you don't need to represent something. I know we talked on this in the calls, but not just now So if you just need to say there's an equipment and it's got one plug with two pins and they're both being used for the same single signal, you don't need to mention the pins or even the plug. Sorry, the connect even the connector. Whereas if you've got some complicated case where you need to have bits of cable, multiple signals, over various different things and you're using some fan phantom of something to carry power and all sorts of things like this or or the point Diego made earlier about the new to deal with entanglement on a third pin those pins then have roles and they may be important to understand"

So you have to sort of use a subset for simple cases And the final, I think a final point on the numbering, there's no reason why a plug couldn't have two connectors on it, applied of a particular size So we need to be very careful with the numbering of the ports, you know, the connectors and so on, and the plugs and mingling them up, because you may end up with one with two on it, in which case you've got to have some sub-numbering or something So I think it's, you can't look at the face them up, because you may end up with one with two on it, in which case you've got to have some sub-numbering or something. So I think it's, you can't look at the faceplate of the card and go, I know how many connectors it'll have on it because the plug may have different connector patterns on it and so on, so you can't number the connectors based upon what you think will be in the plug slot, I don't think So you'll be very careful that numbering. There are two different numbering schemes There are connectors on the card, and there are connectors on the plug and I think they should be separate. So separately in indenting.

For example, the empty I see maybe the empty is not needed because if you have a transceiver component under the port maybe that's enough you don't need the empty Whether we need to have a group, breakout group configuration and the state, maybe with an MDA, we can just configure the state.

And so I was of the opinion that the knowledge that we have today is good knowledge, but in five years, there will be differences, right? Look at the breakout stuff, right?"

So, in other words, this thing is going to evolve the second thing that are did is that when I did the modeling myself, I had, so it was not only IP and optical I also had to deal with servers at some point. So basically at some point you end up with devices that maybe the people here in this room are not even thinking about okay so then I took a step back, right? Because I took all the data of all the models because I am an IP guy, so I looked at, for example, open config I looked at this model and stuff like that and then I said okay can I come up with a model? that is actually generic? that I don't want to look at implementation I looked at implementations, but I said, okay I want my model to be agnostic. And so the way I, what I implemented was, basically parent-child relationship of objects right? And for example, take the empty whole example I have a board and so when you instant it, what actually happens is, are you look at the Cisco or the Juniper or the optical gear and it has certain characteristics right? And what is the characteristic of that thing? It's basically a board with a bunch of ports And those ports are either filled in already, right? Or they are empty right? So in other words, I have an object that represents it and during the instantiation you have the choice to actually, if it's a physical port and you don't have a choice to do a plugability, it's actually configured automatically. And if it's not then you have the ability to, let's say, attack another child's relationship, which is in this case the plug, to that object. You see, so that was the concept that I basically inherited and with that you can actually do lots of stuff"

I said, okay, I even don't want to be specific to optical or IP. That was my, how I i i took a step back and said okay let's be very generic, because it's actually the, I, we someone said before, we have implementation open config we have vendor specific models and stuff like that. At the end of the day, the investment systems shouldn't care from my perspective because we all have to be able to feed or plug that instantiation inside of that model and we have to have the flexibility to be able to accommodate various implementations right so that's I i don't say that that's the way we do but that would be my record recommendation because then you have a generic approach, which is applicable and from an IETF point of view, it's actually a good thing, I think, because then it's applicable not only to optical IP, but maybe also beyond other environments and that also means that you don't have to be very specific on how I on the model itself, because the way I then implemented this I had even certain objects so that's a challenge that you have with Yang. You have to be prescriptive on the thing that you did but what I the way I implemented was like key values and the key and the value can be an instantiation decision You don't have to decide. So we basically don't model what it does it actually has the ability to, I have key value pairs that are that is not really specified inside of the model but it's actually specified in implementation. But the model allows you to have that flexibility you see well but for the key value pairs i think we are there was on this kind specified in implementation but the model allows you to have that flexibility you see well but for the key value pairs i think there was some discussion in that mode you can do that via augmentation but okay yeah yeah you can do via augmentation or you make it flex but that's a detail, I think, at this way.

Yeah, I didn't even think about them at the time. Or I didn't even know about it. Okay maybe you can talk about to understand the pattern. Okay Oscar, this is a cold for doing some joint work before the next IETF on some for the next hackathon. If we can work together to have, maybe we have several options also to have some implementation on the on the models I already did some call for help to come to this idea. I did not get much support yet, but we have an open source implementation around that could be a good base but that's... So you propose an acaton with the two three options Implementation, yes with concrete examples that we can that we can see we can see the pros cons because with the hackathons it is the good thing that we can have some running code instead of just, I mean, I know you want to create, yeah create the variations manually, but I'd like to have more people involved, not that you create in some I need a question yesterday when we speak about Akaton I'm okay, but we need to ask first the the result of what is the result of the acaton you are a expecting to make a decision? So because the risk I see is that most likely we will be find out that the three options are equally good well at least we will be able to see them Okay, okay.

Because now we need three groups that relaps the three options or or if somebody does not that's the option will be dropped. That's the argument, yeah last thing talk about that So just I've been making notes at the same time. So I just a few comments. So I think Victor mentioned and the balance between looking towards the future in terms of doing stuff and versus doing it now I've just cautioned trying to agree in terms of it's good to look at the future possibilities and directions of the things, but also, I think it's also good to try and scope it down and get something done and just having a future possibilities and directions and things, but also, I think it's also good to try and scope it down and get something done and just having in mind when you're doing it is like, does this look like it's extensive? in the future so that's one comment um women was making a good comment about keeping the model flexible and generic and i quite like some of that i think having some flexibility in the model to allow this different implementations to implement it differently sort of a good thing but it also adds complexity to consumers it gives the uh who is sort of implement the systems lots of flexibility so I'd really like to see quite strong guidance, even if the model allows the flexibility to say, we envisage you model it this way and try and encourage, encourage everyone to do it in a similar way, but it's still allowed flexibility. If somebody puts an extra, loan that they can one option we are doing for example in C-camp is maybe we can do the model flexible and then do some applicability statements where we give some guidelines for this specific use case, there are co- way to use this model is this way"

So yes, that's a reasonable approach i would caution though you can do that try and produce those at the same time. Because otherwise, the applicability set before follows after everyone that implemented it nobody's going to change yes I agree So that is to come through. And in terms of hackathons and things, I actually think it's really good to try and get the running code and stuff with that I'm not so convinced of trying to do like two or three different implementations at a hackathon. I would think it's more efficient to try and get an agreement on paper first then try and implement that and then see if that solution works. If it does, you're done rather than doing three solutions. So that's my thoughts Thank you. Hi, this Kent so I think women I had the same implementation way back when and uh the parent-child relationship is extremely flexible I'd like to transition the conversation a little bit to maintainability and scalability Specifically, I mean, this is more of an offline catalog or a library if you will, and it would be desirable for individual vendors to be able to publish their information. It's not something that IETF wants to publish the information for every fruit that's out there And so how would that work? You know, you can almost imagine like Joe mentioned a port type, I believe So what's weird is when I was modeling for Juniper, it's And so how would that work? You know, you can almost imagine, like Joe mentioned, a port type, I believe. So what's weird is when I was modeling for Juniper, they'd have a plug-able interface module, PIM so there's a hole, and the electrical connections inside that hole sometimes they were very fixed to a specific kind of interface, but other times there were PIM modules that could actually plug into this hole with the certain kind of electrical connection or a different kind of hole that supported a different kind of electrical connection So it got very strange in that regard as many to one relationships IANA registries would be great for something like this to capture what is the identity of the electrical or the"

Okay Yeah, just Iowa. Just a quick question on the mapping from the node to the network elements. So right now it's like a one-to-one map Iowa. Just a quick question on the mapping from the node to the network elements. So right now it's like a one-to-one mapping between the node and network element Do we consider a case where you have node that can be mapped to multiple network elements because of abstraction that you're taking on top of the image? inventory, or is it always like one-to-one memory? That's just a question from my side. At this point, this model just considered one-to-one mapping. We don't do any abstraction because"

Okay, I thank you away, just to the point of Iowa, I think maybe we need to look at some text we had in the sea camp draft When we discussed that, at that time, what we said is that the mapping between the northern network element can be many to one. Since it is unique direction, that's easy So multiple nodes can map to the same network element For example, if you have a multi-layer network element, you have one node per layer then you can have multiple nodes and map into the same network element If you want to do instead abstraction, so you want to group multiple network elements pose them as a single abstract node the suggestion in that draw was to use the constructed topology to show the how a node abstract and the level node. So we will have one node in the physical topology, which maps with a single network element and then another node that groups this physical nodes as an abstract node that we don't need to create a different construct that was the idea at that time and I think it was right these physical nodes as an abstract node, that we don't need to create a different construct. That was the idea at that time. I think it was the right approach to follow, rather than making this mapping more complex. Yeah I agree with you on this.

In other words, from the inventory to a topology instead of from a topology to an inventory and it just goes into, if I have a topology, do, is it the inventory? that would be the would reference the node in the land? or should the link the topology reference the inventory? And you're taking the approach that the topology would reference the inventory and I'm trying to understand the pros that you had when you made that having the inventory reference the topology node or lake you understand what I'm saying? Yes, I quite understand what you're saying but actually inventory topologies abstraction right it's not the physical saying The inventory actually existed before the topology, right? Yeah.

Tim, I'm making one of the motivations is that if you already have a network, you have a topology already in place and now you're trying to create an inventory So I'm not saying that one is better than the or one should be preferred over the other But, yeah, can you plan all your inventory? beforehand and know exactly where it's going to go? or is it the, you first plan the topology? and then have the inventory before the independent life? You're just a couple, a little bit worried about the couple and know exactly where it's going to go or is it the you first plan the topology and then have the inventory before. Or are the independent life, so for me, I think that that's irrelevant to the model at the end of the day from I, so when I just joined the queue. So because you have a model whether it was already instantiated and then you discover it and then you populate the data or whether you populate the data ahead of time and then figure out and do that that's how you use the model so that's if irrelevant from the model from my perspective so whether you populate the data ahead of time and then figure out and do that, that's how you use the model. So that's irrelevant from the model from my perspective. So, and I believe, so in other words, how you use the model so you have basically I from what I've seen two ways to use it one is you discover something you already have some so in other words, how you use the model, so you have basically, from what I've seen, two ways to use it. One is you discover something, you already have something in a brown field and then you use it to populate this versus I want to do a green field, I populate this data and as a result you instantiate something. I told you so that's the usage of it, but the model that doesn't have a reflection on the model necessarily Right, I think my question is, do you, plan, you have to inventory, and then would you design the network around the inventory or would you first design the network? and then decide what inventory you need for?

If you do this discovery, you have already something, and then the inventor is a result of what you have, right? So these are the two ways of how you use it. But the model itself doesn't care So the question really is, is that do you so the model doesn't care so, so, but, so you're saying, it should not matter whether you reference the topology from the inventory or whether you reference the inventory from the topology. That's what you're saying. That's a different conversation in my view because I saw the way I what I did by the way, so I have a topology and the topology references the physical inventory objects so that's how it was done so in other words but there is a bidirectional relationship somehow because if you want to do look up or UI and stuff like, so that is always a but a bi-directional relationship but typically you was assign a note to a topology one way or another right and but you typically want in you want somehow to understand the bidirectional behavior because sometimes people do a look up from a node and then they want to know the topology or the other way around So so that's more how you but then you're you're reinforcing this to say you know typically you start with the topology and you're signing inventory to that or referencing the inventory to that policy The inventory is this or not?

I will discuss them in a second Of course, new software versions, there might be a bit of a collide with the software model there We can discuss about that. Security alerts end of light or end of service. The last three probably from external services, but also related to how the assets are operated Can you please next? so we have to drive The first one is about the probable statement So basically, I don't want to take a lot of your time. So basically, you'll we just discussed, it describes that in detail It is not currently on call of adoption, it's currently in a previous step, but we will probably start it I will take a couple of minutes to try to make propaganda about this Do not manage in your asset. How your asset operates or these extra features that they have it's basically like a sign that you might not be able to operate at well let's give an example of the breakout port Let's say that we have now, with this work, word that it alone made, that we know that there a port available in Vancouver and then we know we can use it So we, well, we think we can use it. We go, we plug something, and it doesn't work well maybe three hours after debugging you rely that you have a pay-as-you-grow license maybe from Huawei, maybe from Nokia, because they both offered that And even though the port exists, it cannot work because you don't have a license supporting it Or break-out ports don't work because they need a specific license These are real cases and areas.

So all of these sort of things are important for operating the network real life. So at least we can agree that this is a problem to discuss. This is although we want to agree on the first part for the working group adoption and then we can see how we model because you can see it's a very complex topic to model next please a second draft is about the data models of basically trying to expose information to be able for a software for a person to obtain the information needed to support the management of an asset We, well, agreeing with the chairs, we are waiting for the inventory model to be more mature We think we're aligned thanks to Jan Lee Lidman, I think, I mean, I cannot thank him enough. I mean, he has suggested ways for us to be flexible on how to block different models Right now, for instance, we can work with the open config one, and I think as far as we have a decent keys, either sort of grade, natural, whatever, from the inventory model, we will be able to plug it with what we have but we'll wait until that one is more mature So we have that have that so it's flexible enough to have what we are doing basically now while we wait is that we are expanding the document.

So I will let you guys discuss the charter or not, but we can create the model and split it, but saying this license exists from tomorrow"

Let me say something I don't believe that the capability model doesn't fit in the current charter What might not belong to the current charter is the life cycle management I mean, how you activate, deactivate compose capabilities, etc But recently I was well, this morning I was mentioning to it in Italy the idea that we could be thinking about following the same or addressing the issue with all these complicated optical holes from a function of point of view. What we have here is that we have described the assets as the valuable things that you have in the inventory because they can do things. It's not that I want to have a pile of iron in a room and I want to describe the shape of the iron The item has a purpose, and the purpose is equally valid for describing the inventory as the shape the number of holes, whether it fits or not in a particular rack. That's something that is weird holes, whether it fits or not in a particular rack. That's something that is, we are talking, we're talking about capabilities, we're talking about what can be done with this, what makes it the whole thing valuable for providing network services other thing of other thing might be that if we have in the model, we have some aspects that are related on how this is composed and used for creating particular services that's something that we can discuss, whether that fits better in a map as a mapping style like what Bo was presenting before on the topology well, the perspective, etc, is something that we can discuss but when I'm talking with the capabilities, thank you"

    "text": "to account that what we are thinking of what we are thinking purpose of this is a functional description and is equally valid as an inventory and it's not an application on the inventory. It's complete what is the description of the goods or the physical things, or physical or virtual things that a network operator has as quiet to provide a value. It's for your service Okay interpuzzi, okay, good, thank you for you using our basic inventory model One question maybe we need to address quickly is whether there are any attributes that are missing in the model that you need, because I would like to make sure that as you release the RSC, we try to release it a quick possible there is no miss there is no gap on what you need in the RSC so you don't need to wait for another cycle so that's an important check that we need to do to make sure that you can build on top of that without major attributes that are missing so far we think we are good So far, we haven't really actually done it but we think we're good okay very good thank you for a few minutes no thank you Mahesh. Thanks, Daniel for bringing up the question of whether everything that is being presented really falls into the charter of the working group because that I think would be important clearly we want to focus on what is in Charter for now, because this always ability to recharter and bring in the more stuff into it, but clearly the focus should be on what is already in the charter so that would be my advice to the working group do that and"

    "text": "Diego I just wanted to make sure I understood your comment Do you agree that what is in charter is what should be done, or are you saying capabilities like? licensing it's just that it's just that in this case capability that could be a tricky concept because it is not like, I want to know whether this device has 10 has supported for 20,000 BRFs is part of the entitlement. How many? BRS am I allowed to use based on the entitlement? So it's part of the describing the entitlement Because if you cannot say that, then you are not really describing the entitlement as it is. So if the charter includes the word entitlement and describing an entitlement requires a characteristic that I will let you discuss actually what it entails in terms of content, but to me, as somebody that has to work with the people that handle the network knowing what a like encompasses or not is important is part of the license. So in that sense, I see the capabilities or the features that we use here are included in the Charter. But now, I am not to see whether this is philosophical reason or not, I will let you guys discuss. But just give us a yes or no, at some point somebody and that's the only thing we want. This is Diego by your of our ID Simply that, no, I mean, I'm not saying, and not say proposing that we I'll go beyond the chat want. This is Diego by order of our AD. Simply that, no, I mean, I'm not saying, I'm not proposing that we'll go beyond the Charter. What I'm contending is that the Charter includes or should include, or including my viewer I mean, then we can go it doesn't include only the physical description of the system or includes in my view. I mean, then we can go, it doesn't include only the physical description of this. But we're talking about the functional and when we're talking about the capabilities, we're talking about functionally describing the system go, it doesn't include only the physical description of this. But we're talking about the functional, and when we're talking about capabilities, we're talking about functionally describing this is. If somebody in the group believes that with the model we are going beyond this description, and again, I may, I may have said that when talking about how they are composed etc we are talking about going beyond, well, we can't scrap this but this is not I mean I would say that we are"

    "text": "scrapping some content, not carving out pieces of it. It's more about how much we are. That's a slippery slope I know So I don't know if it's a matter of interpretation I'm not an English native speaker and not nor a lawyer So, I mean, here different people could interpret the charter in the different ways. If I look at it in point in B of our charter, we have kept track of which physical, virtual devices are deployed in the next our charter we have keep track of which physical virtual devices are deployed in the network including software and other hardware version as well as licenses and entitlement Now the thing is, does entitlements include capabilities? Who is going to give the interpretation? Because someone could say yes, the someone could say no. I agree, Daniel, I agree As somebody that at the final wants to use the model, I need the I don't call it capabilities I need the limits that the entitlements place on a device. I need the limits I don't know how we call them to be able to describe what a license is, I need to have to know what it covers And it doesn't cover time only. It covers also, unfortunately I mean, I wish everything was bullying. That would be amazing much simpler. I don't know um i do not know and the point is that this includes a lot of the complexity of the model is actually doing this. Also it's a pity, but it's the case Yeah, I took the curious to say, let me insist we need that to describe function"

    "text": "with and we the entitlements are the licenses are associated with functionality If the name capacity, offense, you know, some minds of our thinking, we can think about other wording, but we're talking about the thing working and that the fact is that to make the thing work, we need this we model the how the thing works, and we have to, and with this is we are modeling what you can do with entitlements and licenses That's basically the idea. I have a question here but this might be simpler support contracts Support contracts. Cisco SmartNet, Juno's Care, I don't just care. Nokia care might be a matter. So support contracts are the ones that allow you to know whether a device can have, I don't know, firmware updates on the next end years, maybe one, and in some cases you might have spares via the vendor That's important part of the asset like second management The group that handles inventing in a company usually needs to know that Now, it's part of the charter. I don't even have an opinion here. I mean, I know it's important for life cycle and management. I don't know if part of the charter What do you say there? I mean, I'm just trying to, this is a simpler even a simpler simple question to me Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a very good input input for discussion that we need that well do you say there? I mean, I'm just trying to, this is a simpler, even a simpler question to me. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a very good input for discussion that we need to have with Maesh with maesh and Just to add, Daniel, it's Marisol here there is a definition that we include in the drafts, right, for entitlement. And it's a specifically saying that commonly implemented as license, it's commonly sorry, yeah, implemented as license, if you present the rights obtained by the user that allow them to access and utilize certain capabilities of the assets including a feature or set of features"

And yeah it is just to rephrase if that is the right terminology for entitlement As you know, we change from licenses to entitlement to be more general as well But I think this is adding into the conversation, right? to make a decision Perfect. So, yeah, we will do some brainstorming to understand how to move forward In one way or another, I mean, the feedbacks you give are more than value And, I mean, we understand that this is something useful We just need that to understand how to move to move forward in the best way for the working group group so we successfully managed to go beyond the two hours with three presentations only. I think this is a record for 120 meetings of ATF and I would say that that's it for today and the CEO in Dublin Thanks a lot guys, have a good day"
