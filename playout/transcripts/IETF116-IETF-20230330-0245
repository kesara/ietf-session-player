So let me tell you a little bit about first about some of the general ideas behind quantum computing and quantum information. Really quantum information you can think of it as as if you want to be sort green about think of it as our third information edge. The first information age was analog information recorded sound and things of that nature and then the second information ages is digital, which subways. Next step, please. Yeah. So working with bits, of course. And then the third quantum or the third information age will be quantum. Information. And so in quantum information, what we are dealing with is binary data the binary data has particular characteristics the that we will need to understand and utilize effectively, namely super position and entanglement. And each one of the binary data states has a a complex probability amplitude that's associated with that. So obviously, all of you everybody in this room knows that if you have in classical bits you have in possible combinations for for for the state of your system. So in this case, we have three bits, you would have n possible states. In a quantum system, each of those states have your your system is not just in one of those states at line. It is actually in a super position of those states. So part of your probability amplitude exists"

    "text": "for each of these eight possible states here. And in this initial state here, you can see each of the eight possible states from zero zero zero through one one one. They all have the same name input But the distinction between the classical and quantum system is that we have this super position the system is not just in one fixed stated in an initial point in time. Next slide, So what happens during the course of a quantum computation is that the goal of this quantum computation is actually to gather that probability amplitude that set probability amplitude into the one state that represents a solution your problem. That's a really fundamental change to the way quantum system or algorithms are constructed. So algorithms are not just sort of iterate until you find the particular answer, what your what you have to is you have to reconstruct the algorithm in a way that creates interference patterns, constructive interference and destructive interference in the same way that And if you're at the beach and you see your waves of of water at the beach, you'll see when you have two waves that are both at the peak and they come together, comes together and what's called constructive interference on the other hand if you've got one way of off and one wave peak, they cancel out your back to zero. That's destructive interference. You use these two phenomena together to create interference patterns in in the process of solving a problem. And if you do this effectively, then then the hope is but the total number of operations are going to have to actually execute in the process of executing this quantum algorithm will be substantially smaller than than the number you would have to do for an equivalent classical system. In particular, it doesn't mean, you know, don't don't make the mistake of thinking that quantum computers will be some constant factor faster than classical computers. It's not that they're going to be ten times or a thousand times or million times faster. What's going to be different is the scaling of the algorithms in in the quantum domain. As opposed to the classical. Index?"

    "text": "So one way to think about the classes of problems that quantum computers we hope are going to be useful for. Is to think about problems that have a relatively small state description but a large state space. So for example, you know, chess or go, it only takes you a few bytes a few hundred bits to describe the current state of the game. But as we all know, you know, the the the game tree expands like financially as you go more steps through the through the course of the game. So chess and go actually have a little bit too much structure and to actually work well for quantum computers or for quantum computers provide you with a big advantage relative to classical computer perspective, it's the right sort of place to be thinking about this. And the kinds of problems that people are interested in solving with classical computers include chemistry problems, understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules on this was in fact what Richard Fe proposed as the initial motivation for creating classical computers forty years ago. Some classes of optimization problems are expected to be in the same category. And crypto geography probably most of you in the room have heard of what's called Shores algorithm. Guy named Peter Shore, In nineteen ninety four, discovered that classical computers could use the generations of these interference patterns to find the period of a particular function then would allow you to to factor large numbers which in turn affects things like public key crypto. And this hap this discovery happened at about and at an important time in the evolution of the technology as well was just starting to be possible to manipulate individual quan in the laboratory, not yet to build systems, but to manipulate individual quan. And so you generated all of this interest"

So What we're going to build is a quantum repeater network. And, like S just said, the word repeater it doesn't mean the same thing in the quantum world that it means in the classical world. It's not just any fire because you're not allowed to do that. Alright? So next slide please. So the job of a quantum repeated network is to make into end entanglement between a pair of notes. Mod, some arguments about whether or not you know, sort of relative timing sorts of things. Next like. And because this quantum entanglement is a consumable resource the job of the network is to make lots and lots of it. To keep repeating because you're using it as a resource while you actually executing distributed computations. Next stop? So one of the things I really want to emphasize here is that making this end end entanglement is a distributed computation."

And you don't have to worry about sort of operations along the path to just sort of assume that that the packet forward will happen. All of the nodes along the the the path are going to have to be involved in the creation of this end to end entanglement. It this suggests that that it will be a circuit oriented and model with state operation at each of the notes. And so that's the kind of area where people in this room really contributors working out some some of the operations that are involved in us. Next help. So if that's the job of the quantum network, then the job of an individual quantum repeater is next First, to make base level entanglement over our link. You've got a fiber. You've got a couple of Are called bunch of repeater that are at the ends of this fiber, and their job is to make entanglement that covers one hop. Got next. Second thing you gotta do is once you have a set of these one hop entanglement, along this path, you have to couple them together create this end to end entanglement that's going to be used by the applications the end notes. Next. But the problem with this is that these systems are very, very noisy. And so what you have to do in addition to to just creating this in time, you have to monitor and manage the errors and us. Now c is quantum correction, and in some cases, it builds on classical air correction techniques in other cases, it's completely need to quantum stuff. Purification is a form of error detection. That will be deployed in the early systems including the early quantum Internet. And in that case you're your what you're doing is you're building generic entangled states and when you detect an error, you just discard and restart"

Okay. Right next. So my group at K has been working on this stuff since two thousand seven give or take. Excuse me. And we have planted a number of flags on every networking related problem we can think of And every single one of these is just a first step. There's still long ways to go with each of this.

Nowadays to to the actual classical communication. Routing, picking the best path through a network is one of the things we work on when Shelter wasn't in under that fifteen years ago, where you, there was another undergrad along with him, and this was actually the back list these of of my the student sample. At that time? Next. And then multi multiplex are dealing with how you're going to share resources in a network where you have multiple connections that are competing for access to the network. And this was what that was done with a in conjunction with a student of hiro as The wide project director. So it was a collaboration between our institutions on that. Next. And next.

On the was working on how you can deal with that interoperability when you're dealing with networks that have separate methods from managing the errors separate correcting codes Next. Recently, we have done work on what happens in operation of the network in dealing with the network operational security.

And so we want to avoid that so we proposed a relatively simple mechanism that that helps prevent the network from being partition when somebody hijack a single node or a single note that's behaves.

There is. We'll tech and I the the cultures is the Quantum Internet Research group, which met on Monday. This is Very. I think they're about five hundred people on the on the list right now. But the... We look forward to your participation in that as well."

    "text": "Next please. And that brings us to the open mic portion of this. Questions, comments. Help me, I don't understand this. Right? The mics are open on the. We'll. Hi. Richard K. I just have a comment to make about when Shutter said that quantum Internet would be more difficult to build them quantum computers. And I just like to qualify that, that that's true for the case of building false tolerant quantum networks where you're actually connecting computers, but because the key resource of the continental is entanglement, which is achievable between already two q. One can actually already construct application on a much smaller scale. And so it's also important to note that there's a lot of functionality in between today and the long term fault and quantum networks. So Yes. Full will be harder, but there's a lot of space actually get some use out of it before then. Thanks. Yeah. Good thanks. Sam was a good comment. I can't we are not hosts or chairs of this session on this I can't see who's actually in the queue elsewhere. Jean name pops up here at the top are you? Yeah. Great. You're down right. So I'm an amateur, I like to, you know, read about this and find out about here what I'm struggling with. You have a quantum computer. And there is, you there's a certain quantum inside that. And if you want to transferred that state you have to measure it. The moment, they didn't measure it, it collapses into a single state. Now How can I and in networks, we were using? Here's the data. We were serial it and send it across another computer"

    "text": "in order to do some additional processing. So Okay. You can create a tank... Like entangled qb bits across distance. Mh. And they will do some calculation But how can you then So with the third party system. So that means if you wanna create a larger computer, I e through a larger network you always have to sort of start from zero every single time. When you're building up the hold... You want to say, like a network, have a natural for a period of time and then it's and then it doesn't work, and then you have to rebuild it again. Yeah. There's a homework lot going on in what you're saying. And a lot of that's put in the right direction. And there's one particular magic word we haven't said yet. Teleportation. I I was bit about that because this is my completely. So I said earlier one segments I was talking that that Entanglement is a consumable resource. Right inside of the system, And so the job of the network is to make this end to end entanglement. And the entire is actually used for several different things, but one of them is to transfer data from here to there and in the process you consume that that entanglement and it goes away and your original data also goes away over here over here your data gets reconstructed. And that's quantum teleportation. Okay. So the function of the network. Mh. Is to create entanglement between q bits over geographical distances. Yes. Okay. And one of the things we use that for is sending data from place to place. There are other things we use it for, but that's one of them. And so you'll, you know, sometimes read papers particularly written by I've already insulted the physicist runs. I might as well keeping something the"

    "text": "your read rep is written by physicists let's say, teleportation is in application of the quantum that. That's kinda like saying Tcp is an application of Ip. Right? Yeah. See yeah. It it gets your part way there. But the question is, what are you going to do with that why you're doing it. Right? It's not you. Sending data from one post another is not just is not an application in and of itself. Let's see. Next in the queue? Sure anything to say on that but if. Dean's name hasn't gone away but sorry. I don't know your to you up next week. Joey are. So you mentioned kirk before. And in this spirit of keeping contributions going. I was just wondering if there is like a relationship between k the work you're doing here and the new... What was it? I you forget the name? The one that is meeting tomorrow the p whip quantum to music protocols, or if there's no relation at all. Somebody... There is not yet any relationship between the the the the... Let's see is that a working group or a research group that's meeting tomorrow? I forgot working. It's working group. So the... Yes. That's they are talking about post quantum. And so that's classical crypto photography designed to work in a world in which quantum computers exist to end can challenge Rsa and and potentially give whole things things like that. That's what they are after. They are what the work that they're doing is very independent of vehicle we're doing in Q, but but the knowledge that you built in both, I think I think they'll be beneficial for for both of those. We'll check you have any other comments on on on the relationship between Q and the new post quantum group, yeah. I had a look at their meeting desk implicitly excluding any talk about and Q?"

    "text": "So no. Okay. So no no overlap in terms of technical materials have a good clean separation in that, but I think you'll find valuable share alerting and in those our absolutely And then just one more question. I had previously read the Rf see. Well, did now Rf then draft for the quantum architecture principles. Mh. And then you also mentioned the paper that you published more recently, I believe the quantum Internet architecture, I think. So I was just wondering if those are the same or like, how different they are Like, if I read the the Rf, like, should would still be a good idea to read this other water if they're pretty much the same. Architecture principles draft explains, some of the same kinds of things that are now no Rf. Sorry. Explain some of the same things that that we've talked about so far in this session in terms of what entanglement is and this idea of entanglement of as a service I think W tech might have been the one who came up with that phrase in entanglement as service. In my brain that's associated with him. But the... So it explains some of those principles but it doesn't lay down any specific design decisions. And that paper that I put up there that with our quantum internet architecture, Those are the recommendations of my group for these are some of key architectural decisions. Whereas the the Rf talks about the Rf of talks about the Architectural principles. So I think in that sense they're very complimentary. You should probably read the the other see first and then and then the the paper out... Second. Other questions, do we have anybody online? Actually, there was so there was some comment. You want me say is a. Are you alexander? Yes. That's me. Okay. Good. I'd like to just clarify one aspect. In a, sort of previous slides there was a statement that an optical fiber can absorb a photon, therefore will be some signal loss."

    "text": "But then in another context, we're saying that there is quantum communication that works with satellites. That is there is no fiber in there. Yes. So how to reconcile this things? Why don't we just use the flavor that doesn't use fiber, so we don't have the problem. Getting individual photons down for from low to orbit or or medium orbit or Geo synchronous all that isn't at a founding technical accomplishment. Various countries Singapore Canada, Japan have been working on satellite quantum communications. And then China launched a satellite leap thought to work for from from everybody and demonstrated the the creation of entangled photons on the satellite and their distribution to two two sites on the ground. And yet still the success probably of getting those individual photons down is very very low. It's ten to the minus seven or ten the might eight or something. And yet, they're doing... The fact that this works at all is just incredible. There are couple of disadvantages to they to to the satellite based approach. One is that your station for this needs to be a telescope that's about to figure around it cost about three quarters of million dollars. Right? And your satellite cost about six hundred million dollars. Right? And then the other big disadvantage is that because the the satellites in we're orbit bit it's only overhead for six minutes a day. So you can create in entire moment for six minutes a day. Using this one particular satellite. So the complimentary approaches is Which one's going to be the better way to create and entanglement across an ocean you know, these quantum repeat we've been talking about, you know, she slide showed a laboratory with an optical table that's just starting to built out, you know, they're optical table sized things. We are very long ways away from anything that"

Although I'm a elaborate on some research actually which we propose the distribution of quantum entanglement via a cargo ship. Which is have another way of doing potentially distributing it. Thank you. Yes. Actually, yeah three fifth speech communication has specific problem so right, the disruptions. About almost here. So is it We have to shoot the photons to the receiver in that's the such photons of some cannot arrive to the by in the communication as well. So Anyway we have problem. But for for quite while, and I think it may still actually be true. Well, no. Obviously, this satellite does procedure. But for quite a while, the longest distance distribution of entitlement was between two of the Canary islands which was between total on two peaks in the canary islands a hundred and fifty kilometers or so. And that experiment was done by a group from Vienna. By Anton Island group and does Island, was one of three recipients of the nobel prize last year for his work on demonstrating existence of entanglement experimentally, including that work. Alright? And then I have another high level question. Sure. Do we have anything in the roadmap that would accommodate this use case. So imagine new horizons Florida to Pluto. It took a few pictures in this much time. Then it took this much time to send it all back here. Do we have some tool on the road roadmap, which would allow us to send it back here like this Oh, no. So we we actually don't have a slide in that on this presentation. But that's one of key things we we we really have to iterate or"

But you can't use it for transmission of data fast than light, don't make that mistake. Right And creating this entire is way harder than just pumping a bunch of light from a laser down down to fiber. And so so the... So you're the entanglement will enable very different applications that will be used in a very different way that just transfer large amounts of data. So it's gonna be very different that sense. Right. People are starting to move out and it is now twelve forty five. I'm not sure what's next in this room. But I know other people have people have various meetings to go to some of which might start one. So The the slides should already be up in dana tracker We we we we had a little bit of a glitch with Mid and data tracker right before we started. But the Ams the the secretary staff should have already uploaded them be for us. So thank you all for being here. And Those of you who are... Yes. Thank you for the I clear clean your goes up and pleased stop them. And for those of who who are signed up for tomorrow's tour of the the lab. We have about thirty people going on a tour or tomorrow of a lab Yokohama National University, that will move from the front door of this building at two o'clock. Cecilia then. Thank you so much."
