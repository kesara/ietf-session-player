    "text": "the update on the changes next slide please so just to refresh every memory I\u0027m gonna start with part which is a data path so basically there is no data path changes in this proposal the main proposal is again to try to signal ping access networks through a beer core so what that means is that when the people beam signaling on the ping domain arrives at the boundary beer router we need to terminate that pim signaling and somehow signal the the need for the join or the prune throughout the beer domain to signal that in this picture on p2 and p4 as an example they terminate the p.m. signaling and then they need to signal the pin joint to P p1 and p3 to do that we look at the source in this case p1 and we try to resolve the source via an egress beer boundary router and this is where most of the comments were in basically the questions were what the comments were how do we find out the egress beer boundary router next next one please so I already explained thank you so the comments that they came in we came with four ways of founding the egress beer boundary router number one is a static route which is pretty obvious so basically you create a static route with the source and you say next hop is the egress beer boundary router so obviously to resolve the egress beer boundary router it\u0027s a recursive lookup and eventually you will get another be router within the beer domain and then you can actually put the right bits on the bitterness index and forward that signaling packet to the egress boundary router which eventually removes the the beer header and forwards the ping packet all the way to the source the second pretty obvious one is BGP what that means is that between the egress beer boundary router and the ingress beer boundary router the you create the bgp session and you advertise their beer prix fixe ID through that bgp session again it becomes a recursive lookup and you can find your path throughout the beer domain via that recursive lookup the third is some operators that have a ASPR or a ABR and these routers they summarize the route and we can use the field in the summarization route which is the source IP to actually figure out where the egress speed boundary router is so in short what we are saying here "
