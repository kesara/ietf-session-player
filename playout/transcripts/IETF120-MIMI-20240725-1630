Please note it well It contains all the IETF's policies that cover this meeting Do we have a note taker for today? Let me start hiding anyone able to take notes?

Then we will start with FEMI So do you want me to just share? Does it work? There you go Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning session My name is Femi Hulu Mofin So I'll be talking about Mimi Discovery Requirements This is a joint work with a number of people in our group like jobs I'll be talking about Mimi discovery requirements.

So here are some lists of technologies So we add a couple of mini-intosh some lists of technologies. So we had a couple of mini interring meetings where we can of refine this terminology. This is where we are. And I think this really captured the essence of the concept we'll be covering in this requirement. So service specific identifier is an idea that is scope to a specific service it is not globally unique Cross-service identifier is the final name we got to. That wasn't the name we started with originally. So this is a global unique identifier, like telephone number and email addresses. Of course, we have the messaging service provider, which is things like what WhatsApp, wire, telegram, and so on Croc service identifier program This is the telcos and the email service provider. So the issue globally unique identifiers to use us Of course, the last but not the list is the discovery provider. So this had it doesn't yet exist and we ask expect they will be the provider of user discovery service"

So there are two main components of the problem. The force of wishes are certain verifiable mapping between a cross-service identifier and a messaging service provider So we want the mapping to be verifiable We want the mapping to be legitimate Also, the second aspect of it is after a mapping is established we want users to be able to be that mapping to figure out messaging service provider for which a user can be reached. So while we are covering the solving these two main problems, we want to make sure that we prioritize user privacy and we also want to give users some preferences in deciding how they would like to be discovered and of course we want this to work well with Mimi other protocols as well as entry end-to-end encryption So let me next slide provide the requirements for user discovery under these five main components.

We want to ensure that the clients the messaging service provider and the discovery provider are all in involved in computing this representation We also want the client to be able to solve a proof of possession problem. We want to know you actually own that telephone number for which you are creating a mapping for Also, we want the MSPB to be able to assert that indeed, this telephone number is reachable on myself service. If I was up saying, your your phone number can be reached on my service also we don't want DPs because D.P is pretty open.

Yeah, I'm mute How about that? Is that better? Yep. Great Thank you for this. I'm trying to understand the requirement to prevent independent DP assertions on the previous slide it strikes me that that's impossible, right? I mean, if I'm a, no matter what my entity is, if I'm a discovery provider or whatever, I can always make independent assertions right? I can just publish a web page that says this address"

Yeah, so assuming we look at a world where the public key are published externally for each telephone number, for example, as well as the DP, as well as the MSPs if in that way, the DP cannot use a different public key to create that signature Go to use, it couldn't, the DP cannot falsify that signature on the map mapping. So if the public, if the public, if the public for the CISP is in indeed public, it's published on the internet, for example example I have in queue as well. John, go ahead jon peterson to add to that. Yeah, I mean, I think our intention behind this right, is DPs are not the root of the authority in this model, right? Like, the D.P is a place where authenticated mappings are aggregated and the relying parties in this architecture have a trust relation with those trust anchors. Now, what are they? We define a bit of this. In some cases, they may be MSPs themselves It may be a case where WhatsApp is the one who asserts like there's a mapping from this number to WhatsApp and provided people trust them. And we're not going to tell you here in the IETF who you should trust or why. That's like up to the conscience of the individual churchgoer, right? But we've also looked at the third party models, and this is where it gets into some other things I know we're about to discuss and at some length here today but you know, we've looked at these third party models where there will be trust anchors who job is to go validate that relation between an MSP and a TN that is held by a particular customer of that MSP And indeed, in that instance, relying parties in this architecture are trusting those trust anchors Why they trust them? That's up to them, right? But we're going to have a set of practices that are defined that like those things do"

I think so I'll follow along and maybe I'll understand it a little bit better as we go Thanks. All right. Thank you. So what's next? Oh, hi. Brendan. Brendan. Yeah. So you have a couple of requirements here saying that the discovery provider should not be able to make false positives, essentially You shouldn't be able to assert a binding that wasn't actually authenticated But are you also interested in preventing false negatives as well, like suppression? like is the requirement for that oh that's a good point yeah um so we cover, we talk a lot during the entire meeting about bias, like ADP my might just say, okay, you will ignore mappings that exist in other DP and only use its own local database to answer user response. Yeah, is it possibly? but the thinking is that this is very hard to fix technically we should rather rely on policy in addressing things like bias bias Yeah. Okay Ted Thanks very much. I just want to do follow up on a point that I think I heard John make and that is that there's no condition in which you want to set up a system which determines why a particular relying party would trust a person particular responding DP"

    "text": "And it seems to me that a consequence of that is that you don't actually have a possibility of doing a referral base system where a single DP queries other DPs that it trusts because it doesn't know whether the ultimate relying party would trust them or not If that's the case, it's fine, but I think I just want to understand whether that's an intent of the inability of somebody to have one that's not jointly computed by a client MSP and the DP, because it seems to be at that point, since you'd have different DPs, one D D.P, you know, in essence, relaying on behalf of another would be problematic in this And the case I'm thinking about in particular is like WhatsApp and one of META's other messaging protocols If WhatsApp wanted to answer for Facebook Messenger, it couldn't do that. It would have to say, nope, not here, go find somebody else you trust, and they would then have to try Facebook Messenger. Is that correct? Yeah go ahead. Well, yeah, so, I mean, the one kind of correction I'd make in terms of the statement that I made earlier was that I don't view the DPs to the people you trust I view the authenticated mappings is what you trust. The D.P. is merely a conduit for it. And we start getting things like suppression or bias This is where more interesting questions get raised because the D.P could, of course, choose to share with you some recommendations is merely a conduit for it. And we start getting things like suppression or bias. This is where more interesting questions get raised, because the DP could of course choose to share with you some records and not others, and there's like ways for bias to be injected in the system through that. But obviously the intention is that there could be multiple layers of recursion or interaction To me, the authenticated mapping should contain all the information or relying party needs to trust them, provided they could get them. The tricky part is just, you know, if we imagine these DPs are primarily going to be run by MSPs and I think there are certainly that seems like a very likely use case in the architectures that we're envisioning then, you know, the MSPs decision then to show you perhaps only a subset of a"

But it's not a matter of, I trust this because I got it from the deep the DP I would trust this authenticated mapping if I found it on the floor, a piece of paper, and a bus station, right? Because it's cryptographically tested Okay. I think, yeah, it does. I think what you might want to do is modify how you're presenting this requirement three, then, to say that the, that the DP provides a verifiable mapping, but it is not necessarily the DP that's providing you that answer The authoritative DP, if you like, is the one that provides that. And so whether or not you accept it is whether or not you accept that DP as an authority for that MSP and not whether the person you got it from is the DP who signed it. That allows you to both handle your gut it from the side of a bus or pick it up on the bus station floor case or a relay case, which I do think in some cases might be possible Yeah, the relay case should be possible. But again, I hear it hear you using the language. I trust it because I got it from this DP That's the part that I'm poking at, right? Because it's a critical mapping it because I got it from this DP. That's the part that I'm poking at, right? Because it's fair. Yeah. What I should have said is mapping that you trust. Right. What I should have said is that the mapping is verifiable to you even though the DP that helped create that mapping and the DP from whom you got that mapping are not the same. Does that work? Yep totally cool, yes. OK, thanks very much. Much appreciate.

So he has some preference on how you would like to find that recipient However, the recipient is the one being found So we would rather decide to prior recipient preference because it's not active in that action of discussion So we dig a little bit deeper into recipient preferences by kind of coming up with a couple of critical user journeys The details is on the draft, as some of them are shown here. For example, a recipient might say, okay, what somebody is finding me to a particular MS I want the person to contact me through the same messaging service Maybe you find me through WhatsApp So you should find my WhatsApp. I want us to be on the same place me through the same messaging service. Maybe you find me through WhatsApp, so you should find my WhatsApp. I want us to be on the same platform, for example. Or I might say, okay I don't want any other messaging service. Everyone should only find me through wire, for example So the recipient can spread that preference Also, we don't want a situation whereby I have multiple mapping in different messaging service. So the recipient just picks one of them and sends message. So the message gets sent to some random messaging service, which is a horrible experience"

People are cool with that, just making sure, because that's important question. I'm cool with it. OK cool. Look at that. Thank you you next slide okay so this is the only basic recipient preference we're going to provide like when you have multiple mappings with different MSP you can either specify an index or a string to kind of express your preference, attach a preference to that mapping If it's an index, we can use the index for the purpose of prioritizing the mapping Maybe your default is your mapping to MSP 1.

Does this look good? good? Jonathan Rosenberg, it's from 5-9. It's worth no noting also, in case it's not obvious from this, that there is an implied preference, which is just going to happen, which is the same app preference, right? And the reason for that is Mimi concerns itself with only after we've sort of a provider has to decided that this is a federation operation. And the expect, certainly today, if I'm in WhatsApp and I look for another user, like it goes to WhatsApp first Like, so my assumption is, is that when this would be deployed by a website, or Facebook Messenger, it would have already looked for the person inside their own app that's totally outside the same of our control and this sort of engages only when we're probably looking to do Federer looked for this person inside their own app that's totally outside the scope of our control. And this sort of engages only when we're probably looking to do federations. I think it's worth noting that for folks thinking about the same app preference requirement Yep. Thank you, Jenna You look puzzled Alyssa, so. No, I'm not puzzled. I mean, it's like maybe, but I don't really know like fair enough I mean whatever's in the public domain about what the WhatsApp interface looks like doesn't necessarily imply this What it looks like is that they, when you want to, use what they call whatever off network message that's like a separate interface. That's right like is that they when you want to use what they call whatever off network messaging right that's like a separate interface so when you go in there will it necessarily direct you with preference to what's app users maybe not because you already had to navigate this function. Fair enough. I think it's perhaps what I'm saying is better stated as there's a step prior to this who's to WhatsApp? Yes, maybe not because you already had to navigate this funky internet.

Like, what's the connection between business? and basketball and the ability to control it? Oh, yeah. So, so this is like saying that I have more multiple mappings. I can tag them like basketball, for example I know my basketball friends that I can say, okay, reach me on my you know, it's implicit they know I'm kind of in a group with these guys I want to reach him, for basketball, maybe I should use the basketball. If it was like a DNS name, would that be? It's not a DNS name. This is brand new Just a string. I can see I'd be like, contact me on basketball.com And that would help me control my preference contact method. No. It just for the, for the recipient to kind of express a purpose for this mapping Like if you have multiple mappings from me and I tag this as a basketball I'll probably pick the basketball one as opposed to it mappings from me and I tag this as a basketball, I'll probably pick the basketball one as opposed to any other one.

So John peterson just said at the end of the last slide, that everybody understands that we are punting this, we're not going to make a decision about how this works, and we're going to leave it to the MSP And I just wanted to flag that I think what we're saying is we're going to leave it to the mini- Client app, not to the MSP"

Is that right? Absolutely. Yeah I mean, so what we're talking about here on this slide is a little bit different from previous slide and that we're now looking potentially categories and ways you could group your contacts, which, to me is another client implementation question If, for example, I don't know who that means basketball, friends are but he does right and you know there I can am imagine there being a way that he could curate that, that would make sense. I think in the previous slide, we were talking much more about the broader um kind of uh sender and receiver preferences negotiation problem and the way that we could try to suck out, can I push like a policy document? up to an MSP or perhaps some even more authoritative entity that explains how I want these things to work, that that entity will be responsible for executing when you go to a discovery provider? and the discovery provider is giving you a list of potential MSPs to contact. We're punting on that. What I think the little bit of this little wedge that FEMI and FEMI and I don't entirely agree about this is I think he knows from our previous offline conversations. The wedge that Femi is proposed we put into this is a very rudimentary. If I can like group my own contacts thing, right? There should be a way for me to get that from my client into something that will determine to some degree, how the MSP behaves, but I do think this is orthogonal though to exactly how the Mimi client level streams operate It sounds like you're saying that I'm going to depend on the messaging service provider to tell me how to route things"

And, you know, Richard, I think, had some slides that he constantly showed about really where the line of demarcation is in Mimi between what we're trying to achieve, what we're not trying to achieve Broadly, what we're saying is we don't think we have enough control over the way that MSPs are going to prevent a user experience to be able to be very prescriptive about the requirements in this space We can be at least somewhat prescriptive if we feel like it about the MSP to MSP communications the way that once you say I want to communicate with this, what happens after that? And, you know, in the interims, we went through this and I believe you were on at least some of the interim calls, this question of, is it? really, for example, the client that talks to the DP? or is it the MSP that talks to the DP? on behalf of the client? And part of what you know, we threw our hands up about in this was, well, really, what is the distinction between the client and the MSP for a lot of the way? these MSP implementations were? At the Mimi layer, we're concerned about the security association, a completely different question but this high level like routing how do I discover how do I figure out which MSP I need to communicate with? Like that, it's really hard for us to tear apart what the client and MSP's roles are in that. Does that, does that help? I mean, it does, but it also worries me deeply because it sounds to me like you're saying, we are conflating the MSP with the Mimi client, and I think that's a problem. No, yeah you know, it's the user experience. It's the user experience of the MSP that we're conflating with the MSP But the user doesn't experience an MSP.

Thank you Yeah, uh, somewhat related to like the last question about who talks to the DP, is it the MS or the client, does this discovery mechanism? include the same app discovery? or does this handle only cross-app? Because if the same app is implied the same app preference is implied it might use a different mechanism that is inside the MSP Oh, okay, yeah Yeah crosshop, yeah, but we did not, mm-hmm so, so if like same app is the MSP's responsibility, I think, well, it's like, for the same app case, we might be able to like eliminate some of the like, cryptographic stuff that implies both uh, is used in multiple servers Yeah, same app is already, is everything is local within the MSP, they already have, is this same app is already, everything is local within the MSP.

We want it to be flexible for, for discovery client, whether it's the MSP or the app, to have different levers for tuning out a discovery requires its process Next, before we come to the requirements I'll talk about processing So for the processing, we know doing a discovery, is a privacy-sensitive operation because it leaks the social graph of the user So what we arrive at as a requirement is you either provide the identity of the entity making the query or you protect the query itself"

So there might be some standardized way in with discovery providers you operate We, Mimi is not special that, we just an understanding for that. Also, we also expect that certain queries maybe queries that have federated may potentially be processed by maybe 10 tens or even double digits 50 DPs to see whether that mapping exists in their data base. In practice, that can be really expensive in a federated setting. So for queries, that are, that is a fork, we should give the discovery provider leeway to rate limit client So that means they may choose to rate limit clients to maybe 10 of those four queries per day just because of the cost And also some discovery provider may because the end point queries per day just because of the cost and also some discovery provider may because the their endpoints they are is low throughput they may not be able to process queries past enough and things like that, so they will not kind of become the slow hand link in the chain So a DP can ration requires to do those endpoints to improve viral trouble.

So non-deport queries to queries whereby you say just find me broadcast this request to all other DPs anyway I don't care to find if a mapping exists for this telephone number So it's like a fuck. Okay Okay So because that is an heavy load on that federation, because many, many DP potentially could be working on that. So that's why we, it's very expensive expensive yeah in terms of responses we won't to be able to accommodate different number of mappings maybe no mapping, one mapping, two mappings, and so on And secondly, we want the client to be able to say, I want a verbose or a compact response Yeah, verbose means you should include all the metadata in including the digital signature so that the client will be able to actually verify the signatures.

So the top two are for the request The last two is for the response So the ones in between is for the processing John? Yeah, I assume to say a little bit about both of those two chunks and places I still think we need to suss out a bit like what we're trying to accomplish here in you know, to the second one in particular you know, everything that I said earlier about why we trust mappings goes away in that company form, right? And it is indeed just the deep that you are trusting in this instance I can imagine architectures in which that is reasonable and there are architecture in which your MSP and DP are the same entity, and you have a trust relationship with them and that seems okay if all the mappings that they have accumulated are done in some manner that you approve of. But I really don't understand how users would ever be able to discern that and like to be honest from a security perspective it just creates a glaring and unnecessary gap in the architecture that we're defining overall here. So I think a much for that is pretty strong, just personally to me, for we're trying to go through and, like, you know, vet some of these today You know, to the first, bit, and again, this pokes at especially at 10 here at these questions"

The idea that a user is aware that a federation exists or, you know, a user's says, well, I think, you know, again, because if we look at this at like the high level objective is to open up an architecture that is dominated by gatekeeper I get real nervous when we start talking about, oh, well you know, it turns out there's only five MSPs that I trust and it's the gatekeepers. And like everybody else, I don't know Like that is exactly what this entire enterprise here is attempting to not necessarily a road, but at least provide an alternative way of casting it. So we need, I think we need to be super careful about the way that we cast filtering and surprise in this.

Yes, I wanted to support this I mean, I think that the purpose of this is actually not ending up with like the usual oligopoly of five operators doing everything, including the mappings and the certification of the ownership of the CSIs I mean, I'm thinking at how this would work in my own case I mean, I have an email address, which I would like to use as my CSI.

And I don't see why we need more than that okay domain name okay Hey, so I just had a clarifying question. It seems like the Federation model that you have in mind here is essentially that I ask my local DP to answer a query. And if that DP can't answer, then I kind of just like, shotgun to a bunch of random people. Is that right? it depends yeah so local DP to answer Corey? And if that DP can't answer, then I kind of just like shotgun to a bunch of random people. Is that right? It depends, yeah. So, I mean, we know that's why we said a DP should be transparent about how they process query. We don't want their practice to be proprietary and eating So if a DP says, okay, for my DP, I don't federate, I respond to your request using my own data and I created those mapping. So the user is aware of that Or ADP may say, I have business relationship with this order listed entities and I regularly fed federate queries with this entity because of that business related this other listed entities, and I regularly federate queries with this entity because of that business relationship. So we want them to be transparent about this So we can't really say you have to rely on your database alone or you have to federate all the time. I mean, there are so many things that can happen in the real world. Yeah Okay okay i guess everyone to gently disagree on the, like I do think in certain contexts, it's probably a good thing for users to be able to understand their federations like explicitly versus implicitly to the context of gatekeepers like if we don't make explicit that they're a separate there"

What is it actually like after Dr came up to talk about again? Yeah, I think it was actually this DPE shotgunning and fanning out in recursion thing And yeah, when I talked about authenticated mappings earlier, I imagined a world obviously in which mappings could be shared, right? If a DP has a set of mappings, they could share them with other DPs, you could imagine a mesh and maybe it would need to be within the context of a federation that, you know, some business relationship that you would choose to share of these records. But underlying this are all these fundamental security questions about exactly how private we think those authenticated mappings are. And, you know, I still think there's a lot of back and forth in our discussions about this And, you know, what we're saying, though, effectively in this draft and then you correct me if I'm wrong, because I, you read it more than I have you know it's up to the MSPs to defend the users from SPAN, is bluntly what the current tone of this is And so, you know, the question of how sensitive it is to actually just spread the DPs out so that you don't need to show what the current tone of this is. And so, you know, the question of how sensitive it is to actually just spread the DPs out so that you don't need to shotgun, right?

We have one more person in the queue it'll be quick this I think it I think there's a point that is really helpful to have for everyone in mind that helps us understand many of these requirements And that's the line that we really can't cross with these requirements, which is we're here and meeting making a federation protocol between service providers and we are not in the business of dictating to them the user experiences of the applications they provide or what they show to users or what end users should be allowed to do. I think anything where we're writing requirements, that go that deep, much as we might all love it, like, wouldn't it be great if we could like make WhatsApp change its font to, you know, it's color to red? like, you know, we don't have that power here, and it's out of scope of the Mimi Protocol. So I think we have to be careful to, to only tell them that things have to go to the client when they're like we have done for MLS because it's cryptographically required. But from an end user experience perspective, we just have to draw the line there Yeah. Thank you Ted? ted hardie, thanks very much, jonathan hoyland I disagree Because I think what we have on here isn't the Mimi protocol requirement it's the discovery protocol requirements and the discovery could be completely divorced from the actual service providers themselves.

And some of those, I think, are critical for privacy. And some of those I think are actually critical for me correct operation. Now, I completely agree with John that, you know, you could have a client that John comes, you could have a client that trusts a particular MSP to shotgun on its behalf You could have an MSP that's part of a federation that does either relaying out the queries once it gets something or you have kind of a federation that pre- pre-populates it into a single database and does it All of those could be possible, but I think we have to be very, very careful in where we say this is going to be up to the MSP to decide because otherwise, you know, we're not actually providing any value to this discovery protocol over somebody being part of a wall garment that we're already in So I think we do have to acknowledge that there some pieces to this that we're going to sign up for and people will either choose to use the discovery protocol or not, but that aren't going to be completely, you know, the MSP decides So I think one thing that could be useful to do is I know we don't have a lot of examples in the wild of Federation, but we do have examples of siloed systems and some federated things just to look at what the existing user experiences around discovery discoverability, I guess, because obviously we're not going to we're not going to dictate what that looks like in the future and the federated case, but certainly that should, that could give us a little bit of a sense of what the providers that are in the market today might want to be able to support and I suspect it's like not a ton of options, right?

And then the user becomes discoverable by other user And then some other time, point in time, the user recreates the mapping maybe to rotate the keys and so on And then, after a while at T3, the user disconnect the phone number. So the phone number becomes invalid However, the mapping still exists in the mapping back-end for the dictionary provider. That means at T3, other users when they discover that mapping, the mapping is incorrect because it is mapped to an inactive telephone number I also understand that when someone disconnected phone number, there is like a period where the phone number goes to a pool is not immediately reassigned to a new user. I think in the US is 45 days minimum of 45 days and so on So the discovery will still be finding that mapping, even though the phone number is now in the inactive pool pool the other the possible mitigation this is a very challenging problem because telephone number routing, like"

So it's a very challenging requirement So one thing is to say for DPs, they could subscribe to this pool So when a phone number gets harder, they just broadcast that phone number to say this phone number is not active, invalidate all mapping that existing your backend with it. So this is challenging to do, but as a possible solution. The other thing is to say assuming when the user, user zero, when it disconnect the phone number, maybe it got user gets a new phone number, and it now changed the mapping with the MSP the MSP could broadcast that to the federations so that they know, hey, this old phone number is no more valid, remove it from your backend So it's very challenging Now, come to T4. A new user get as assigned the same phone number And the user does nothing And then at T4, the mapping of course the mapping will be incorrect When discovery happens, it will be finding the old user, not the new user or owner of the CISP that can be challenging Then the user, the new creates a mapping to a different MSP. So now we have a situation whereby we have the hold and the new that are both discussed So that is very challenging.

I go on to a couple other things? Great, okay okay All right. Then we also have this concept of, can you? go back, please?

And then finally, we have things which are not really related to the role specifically but functions, for example, that are maybe required or optional or forbidden, like whether for example, you can imagine that in maybe in an enterprise setting, the over room, where you want read receipts to be mandatory But in like a large open group, you don't want to have all that traffic and so they're forbidden and while maybe in some other groups they are optional And, you know, I there are a lot of these services that have policies for things like particularly in an enterprise environment for if I want to create a join link. Maybe I have it, I want to allow people to create join links, but they're only valid for a particular amount of time or they're only valid for a single user at a time, or they're only valid for a specific user Okay all right, moving on to the next slide So I have three examples here of different sort of attribute-based access control room policies Just so people can kind of get an idea of what could be turned on and on of get a an idea of what what could be turned on and off.

There's also no guest So, you know, presumably this would be the kind of thing you would do in a consumer environment where this is just I want I want all my friends to be able to chat and like anybody can add anybody else There's still a concept of a group admin, but um to be able to chat and like anybody can add anybody else.

They can kick they can promote and demote, for example, up to a speaker, and they can create joint links So like the moderator is really concerned about who has particular roles and who can be added and removed.

Now, if a provider wants to say you can create a room and here are the policies, they just need to express their existing policy in terms of these attributes. They don't need to go and implement some new, you know, complicated thing they don't need to implement the entire framework But clients need to be able to to, authorize, to react and authorize different actions and verify that they are correct based on the policy that is created So this, I think, allows a fairly, you know, a much more simple way for clients to be able to interoperate with a variety of different types of rooms with having to have, you know, for us to all be arguing about well what is a you know what is a moderator get to do?

Yes This is particularly an issue for guests So if you have guests, in an environment where you have users, who have a sort of you know, a confirmed identity, them changing their names so that it might be mistaken with another users another user's identity that is, that's something that is on, is top of mind for many channel administrators, but I mean, if this were in, if there's, this were in a Discord room, for example most people don't care you would you could create whatever name you want and no one, no one there, you know no one cares if I if I have the particularly outrageous name or if it even conflicts with somebody else i i haven't really figured out the nuances between the three different classes of rooms that you presented, but I noticed that attendees in all cases could change their own names and I wasn't sure whether the trust relationships were such that attendees should be able to pose as somebody else.

So when a client needs to decide, was a particular action a allowed or not, it's looking at the attributes associated with the role that it was assigned to a particular user So Alice sees that Bob tries to remove another user Alice is going to look at whatever role Bob has, and then is going to look at the definition for that role and is going to look to see if can remove participants is. If that attribute is enabled for the role that Bob currently has. Does that make sense? I think so, yeah.

So here, like, based on this discussion we had earlier in the week, this is a proposal that it was based on talking through with some folks and kind of trying to propose a way forward that seemed workable here So you may recall that on Monday we discussed a spectrum of protection levels, things ways that metadata might get exposed to different actors in the in the Mimi ecosystem So the lowest protection level is the one we're at right now where the spec is right now, where everybody sees everything except for the messages. So the client, the hub, all of the followers can see who's in a room what the policy is and all that stuff going all the messages that manage that stuff The next step up, is to deny information to the follower servers so keep the Hub server in the loops so it can provide additional you can help out with"

    "text": "policy enforcement with fans, it can add new devices things like that. Obviously, to keep the clients in the loop But the followers, they aren't doing any work. So don't tell them what they don't need to know. Conrad also decided a scheme for doing suit pseudonyms to so that even if the Hub server is seeing some of these policy interactions and assisting with this stuff, they only see the users internally hub server is seeing some of these policy interactions and assisting with this stuff, they only see the users in terms of pseudonyms that can be per group and so they ultimately leak very less information about the user and the users' activities in the system And finally, Brendan sketched a scheme on Monday where only clients would have access to what's going on in the room The hub would basically be locked out of everything So all of the hub and all of the followers would be locked out of basically everything. And that comes obviously with some some sharp, pretty sharp functionality tradeoffs so what I'd like to propose today is that we kind of cut off the two ends of the spectrum the where we are today is, you know, we know how to do better than that. It's unnecessary oversharing the client version seems like it's too much functionality loss to be practical for what we're trying to do in this working group And we focus on these kind of middle two options. So we have the clients and hub server option level two as a baseline, the mandatory to implement thing that we do by default in the protocol and then have work on the pseudonymous version of the focus can opt into Let me move to the next slide, please The clicker is kind of, you only have a few slides You want to be on three? 24. It's actually 24 Oh, okay. You're for the original death and Brendan is in the queue so"

    "startTime": "01:24:03",
    "text": "queue. So, Brendan, let me defer. I'm just going to, this is only like three slides. So I'll just going to breeze through it and then we'll have as much discussion as we would like at the end So the insight here with this kind of two-level design is that the core protocol doesn't actually care what the identifiers it's dealing with represents. So the core protocol is kind of agnostic as to whether an identifier as a pseudonym or an actual nym that actually represents a stable long-term identity for a user So if you kind of compare the regular and pseudonymous versions, they overlap entirely in the core protocol, and there's just some extra bits around the outside that the pseudonymous version needs to go So you need to do things like fire pseudonyms on unwrap pseudonyms, you know, associate abuse reports, things like that so it kind of wraps around the core protocol So the concept here is to kind of set hooks in the base protocol. You need a little bit of capability negotiation, right, because you multiple actors are collaborating here. So you'll need a specification so it interoperated You need to negotiate when you can do this But that's kind of the a specification so it interoperates you'll need to negotiate when you can do this but you know that's that's kind of the the affordance you need to make the pseudonymous stuff go in the base protocol so the idea is in the base protocol lock out the followers and kind of set the hooks that the pseudonymous stuff needs to get started. And then we can do the pseudonymous stuff as a separate add-on there So I think we're the last slide you're working you don't you point it over here anyway it's okay you made it the proposal in more detail than the first slide. Same proposal as the first slide is with more work So basically two documents here base protocol document. We take on this semi-private message thing that Rowan discuss, which, you know"

    "text": "private message of, you know, encrypts with MLS, the control messages, and also leaks them out to the hub server. So you expose the information to the hub, but not any followers And we make sure, as we're doing this, that we have actually have that agnosticism and we have enough of those negotiation hooks to get the pseudonyms tied in when we need to And then work the pseudonymous version in an extension document that says how you add those extra bits around the outside of the core protocol to make a pseudonymous version go. So I think we can start, I propose the proposal is we start with two documents and then, you know, as we mature, you know, revisit these questions as to, you know, what's mandatory implement whether we want to merge the two together. And so, you know, pull the pseudonymous stuff into the main document or things like that But kind of working parallel tracks to start and then, you know, revisit as we go So that's the last slide discuss So if we can go back just like, two, please, where you say there's too much functionality loss or the client only approach, what's the functionality there that you're concerned about losing? This is what we discussed in the Monday session. So in the uh in client-only case, you can't have a server assist in enforcing things like bans, right? You have to do that at the client, at the incline level You can't have the server assist with new clients joining because it's server can't have the group info to distribute So those are both, I think, pretty severe functionality losses so for the happy to have folks, you know, agree or disagree with that so for the first one of the server not being"

So for the first one of the server not being able to assist with bans. Sorry, can you speak up a little bit? For the first one of the server not being able to assist with bans, I assume that is like service-wide bans that's not room-specific bands you mean, like where the whole list of users isn't able to be shipped down. Certainly that would be the case, yeah. So, I mean, a ban in the sense of, you know, I don't want to talk to Jonathan anymore. I don't want him in any group that I'm in I don't want him to start any of your conversations with me Just like, get out of my life, Jonathan Like, that's, you know, you could in principle enforce that on a device basis, but it's a lot simpler to have that done at a centralized point okay but with pseudonyms how are you still able to do that, though? Like if jonathan hui joining with a pseudonym, how does the service know that this is jonathan hoyland to block him? Oh, yeah sure. There are not, I mean, it's, I'm not saying the pseudonym are without trade-offs. That's why it's an opt-in and not the baseline I think the sense I got from the discussion on Monday was the the tradeoffs were less severe with pseudonyms than they are with with client-only approach. OK, so if both three and four, both don't really allow this server to enforce like service white bands then it sounds like what's left is the server support for external joins And if you remember at one of the interim, we talked with Conrad Conrad if you remember one of the interns we talked with Conrad about an approach to allow server assist with encrypted handshake messages, and so with pseudonyms, the downside that it has is that you have to do like this handshake with users to be able to add them to the group And with the sort of encrypted server assist, the downside there is that you need a secret key to be able to externally join the group So if those are the"

    "startTime": "01:30:00",
    "text": "two things, is we need a secret key to add someone to a group or I need a secret key to externally join, it's seems more user-friendly to require a secret key to be able to rejoin a group than to have to add someone else to a group Does that make sense? Or would you agree with that? I'm not sure I'm following. But just to, since Alyssa pulled this up, this is the chart that Conrad presented to feature comparison It kind of gives an idea of the feature tradeoffs with the two proposals where me, me, me is the pseudonym approach, encrypted handshake messages, is the client-only approach. And there's two of these there's this and then there's also the in room I think we've got a little bit of accuse of Brennan you want maybe have another couple of folks in come back? Who's next? jonathan lennox Just a clarifying thing. This is just talking about the metadata outside the MLS context, so it doesn't imply pseudonymity inside or one way or the other. Correct, yeah Okay. Yeah, this is specific about everything that's outside the MLS envelope things like policy management, the roster at the MLS there Okay, yeah, so I wanted to clarify that in the base case that a provider can still ban a pseudonym in that room and that that that that a provider can still ban a pseudonym in that room and that that that would still work just fine in the sort of third in that third level So I think we have, I was under the impression that we had pretty strong consent that we needed these requirements"

    "text": "CKG Hi. So I'm just, uh, it sounds like there's a couple of specific things that we want in terms of that we would expect metadata to be used for for managing the operation of the road like bands and I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to characterize this by saying we have these two operational requirements that we want to have available for someone who does not have access to the content of the discussion. And then try to figure out how we parse those requirements into capabilities that we can be provide to some external party, whether they are the hub or not Is there a reason why we're trying to tie these requirements to the hub? I wanted to have a conversation on a hub that you know, I wanted to be able to enforce bans for, you know, for rejoins on, but I wanted to delegate those bands to, you know, my preferred band provider without leaking information to the hub about who was joining and who was getting banned Is there a way to frame this discussion so that we don't tie? these specific, we can identify specifically the function of the that we're trying to retain and then provide you know, the key structure that's needed so that some party can provide that functionality without getting access? to the contents of the messages. Does that make sense as a alternate way to approach the problem? Could I respond to that? Yeah, I'm not sure who that was, but That's Rowan. Sorry, before you respond, sorry can I just ask a clarifying question, which is is what you proposing agnostic to either of these two? options that we're discussing right now? Since in neither case, are we capable of doing this, of supporting this ban functionality"

    "text": "so i don't think we're capable to make sure we stay on track with what we're trying to go with this discussion which is to i think if i could answer on dkj's behalf it sounded like the core aspect of what he was saying was in what I was hearing, DKG say there was, there would still be so non-member of the group entity assisting this stuff It just may not be the hub provider that's that entity. Am I capturing you right there? Yeah, that's right. I mean, let me just say as a baseline, I don't actually believe that any hub provider can effectuate a complete ban because of civil attacks, right? I mean the malicious party can just sign up for a side puppet account and come in, whether there are pseudonyms or not You know, I mean, that's just how the universe works Well, I have a real name policy in my next Right, yeah you're looking for the fireworks no but right so but so what I'm, what I'm, what I'm trying to identify here is that there's some functionality that we want some party to provide without giving that party access to the content of the community of the discussion So Rohan's like jumping at you know, chomping at this bit. Conrad, are you okay with Rohan jumping ahead? okay yeah so the answer, the answer to your question is, that if we allow semi-private message, the external receiver, you could set an external receiver to be your external ban provider So I think for simplicity, we didn't specifically discuss that But technically, you know, the way that we discuss that, but technically, you know, the way that, the way that we proposed to go and implement this, you could totally do exactly what you asked asked That was exactly what I was going to say. The baseline, what was proposed as baseline on my slide with using semi-private message It says hub provider there, but in principle you could arrange the crypto to go elsewhere Now I will say that the hub"

    "startTime": "01:36:00",
    "text": "provider is like physically the hub, so it's kind of in you know, the natural place to do policy enforcement But, you know, the crypto could accommodate other designs Conrad Okay. On the risk of kind of interleaving the conversation threats here a little bit, I wanted to go back with what Brandon said yeah, there's, with the encrypt the handshake messages, there's probably something we can do to enable these the server-assisted join or external join But by doing that, by having these, encrypted, the encrypted ratchet tree and the encrypted group info on the server, tracking it, we leave metadata again. So if we want to do it efficiently, then if I send an encrypted commit, I all essentially send the encrypted path to the hub but I have to tell the hub, like, which path it is So then the hub knows which leave the center is in high likelihood, except maybe, like, it gets a bit fuzzy, you know, if you have an ad and it updates a couple of paths then it gets a bit it the know, it's a bit softer but you still kind of lose metadata I just want to say, yeah, it's probably possible to, to, to get working, but then you leave metadata again so you kind of move closer to the students in terms of what you actually protect. It's a trail of again I just want to jump in here for that Yeah, thank you, Conrad. So I sat down and I thought a little bit deeper about why I disagree with what's on the slide currently And the reason is because encrypted handshake messages we're talking about sort of a stock MLS feature, like an MLS thing that already exists. Me, me, me, me is something that we invented though. So if in"

    "text": "inventing something new is on the table, then the choice is not between me, me, me, me is something that we invented, though. So if inventing something new is on the table, then the choice is not between me, me, me, and this stock encrypted handshake things The choice is actually between me, me, me, me, and the tree wrap idea we discussed at the interim And they have different sort of functionality tradeoffs Ah just making. Everything is new here. Like none of this exists Well, so with the encrypted handshake messages, what we're talking about is using just the the stock MLS encrypted handshake messages feature we don't have to invent anything new we don't have to do any kind of cryptography with the pseudonyms approach. We do have to invent something new But the question is, what new thing do we? invent do we do the pseudonyms approach or do we do the tree wrap approach And so actually in-depth discussion the differences between those two approaches is actually what's relevant here, not the difference between pseudonyms and stuff MLS encrypted handshake messages. Does that help? Yeah Jonathan Rosenberg 5-9. I would say from a just pragmatic making progress thing, the most important thing to decide today is what's in the baseline. Like deciding what future extensions we may write one day where one day is tomorrow or next year, like we can always do that What matters is producing a baseline and then make sure the sufficient extent Like deciding what future extensions we may write one day, where one day is tomorrow or next year, like we can always do that. What matters is producing a baseline and then make sure there's sufficient extensibility hooks in the baseline to facilitate the addition of new things downstream whenever we decide to do them. So I to facilitate the addition of new things downstream whenever we decide to do them. So I'm still, so I think if we think about it that way, to me, I'm still in favor of the proposed baseline and would suggest that we, like, we don't even have to agree on exactly which protocols will do later, like, that we can just agree on what's in the base baseline and would suggest that we, like, we don't even have to agree on exactly which protocols we'll do later, like, that we can just agree on what's in the baseline. That's a thought Okay"

    "startTime": "01:40:02",
    "text": "Do you have feeling one way or the other about that? Okay. Well, I'm trying to think about how to structure the set of questions here. So let's just come back we'll come back to that in a second, but let's deal with the truth wrap first so i think on the tree wrapping I think we've talked about it several times It does seem like it's a, it's, it's a second, but let's deal with the tree wrap first. So I think on the tree wrap thing, I think we've talked about it several times. It does seem like it's related, but it's a bit orthogonal as well. And I'm curious if there's anybody else who has an interest in continuing to pursue that as an option that we need to consider at this point in time So if there's those people get in the queue, get up to the mic, or put it in chat Raphael Raphael Yeah, since I worked in tree wrap, I'm not entirely sure how this is being positioned now So I think initially it was only meant to be an idea to come complement the pseudonyms for a very specific way of actually encrypting the ratchet tree So in my mind, at least, this is not a standalone concept that should be debated as a student particular solution to the problems we're discussing here. So I just want to say I'm a bit confused as to what people interpret when they say tree ramp Okay, thank you, Raphael. Go ahead, Conrad maybe just for my own sake, but maybe everyone else is so well. So we're now discussing like we're still with a discussion between the pseudonym-based approach and the criminal hand-check messages approach. And sure, we can assume that although we haven't worked out the solution we can have an external join with encrypted handcheck messages using tree wrap again"

But that's still leaves us with a different both different both in metadata production and functionality doesn't the question now to maybe go to how quant or like what exactly the difference is in terms of quantifying? sorry, what exactly the difference is, is, the blossom functionality? and the metadata protection and see if the tradeoff is worth it Is that roughly what we're talking about here? I guess I've kind of lost track of it. That is literally the conclusion that we're trying to, I thought that we were trying to come to today which is, Okay. What if we thought we needed to select a particular approach for the, the option that will be metadata privacy protective whether people are comfortable selecting the pseudonym approach. That was the question we were like attempting to TF for today in addition to the question about what is the baseline. Now jonathan hui arguing we should separate these out and we should first ask about the baseline and then we may or may not need to decide today about the metadata privacy approach. But honestly, we've talked about this a lot and I kind of would prefer to put them both to bed today does that make sense Conrad? Yeah, that makes sense And yeah, maybe to just since the queue is empty, just my own two cents, or clearly I'm biased towards the student approach. I like the kind of just the fact that the hub can actually do some policy enforcement. So yeah, just wanted to highlight that even though the encrypted handcheck messages can make, we can make the extra join work or the service just work I think and having that hub and inspect messages and do some sort some amount of access control. For example, the attribute know, the attribute based access control that Rohan proposed, I think is is worthwhile"

    "startTime": "01:44:05",
    "text": "So I've already said this, but just to reiterate a little bit clear, the difference between pseudonyms and tree wrap, it's totally about user experience So with pseudonyms, you have to go through this handshake with every user that you want to talk to you to be able to get like a pseudonym key for them and if you don't do this hand this handshake we're both users have to be online, you actually can't add that user to a group with the tree wrap approach you can add anyone to a group anytime. The restriction is solely on when you're able to do external joint Could you repeat that, please, Brendan? Which part? All of it? Yes, please Okay, so the difference between pseudonyms and tree wrap is completely about user experience The user experience of pseudonyms is that you have to go through a handshake with every user that you contact, where both users have to be online and you have to get like a secret from them to be able to add that user to a group and if you don't do that handshake with every user, then you actually can't add them to a group with the true rep approach that's not true roan can you please let him finish and I see you're in the queue. With the tree wrap approach, you can add any user to a group anytime The only constraint is on when you're able to do external joins Conrad Okay, essentially what Rohan said I don't think that's, that's accurate, accurate. So, it's true that for the, um, pseudonym-based approach, you need to have some sort of connection establishment protocol. It's not true that both have to be online You can just send the user an invite, and they can accept it asynchronously. And then you have the key material you need to add them to groups. It's essentially like a consent mechanism"

    "startTime": "01:46:00",
    "text": "that we probably want anyway. And just in terms of terminology by tree wrap we mean, like, it's a method of encrypting stuff so that you get PCS-like guarantees for, for example, in the pseudonym-based encrypted credence that you have to store with the group, but you can also use tree rep to encrypt the ratchet tree just what it credentials that you have to store with the group, but you can also use tree rep to encrypt the ratchet tree. Just want to make sure that we don't equate tree rep with the hand check messages approach. So those are two different things Go ahead, Rowan Oh, okay, I guess Conrad said what you were going to say Okay. So now we have to figure out how come to a decision I'm still, hmm? you're sitting down. OK, fine Again, we've, oh, you're back in the queue. Are you in the queue? Um, if you've, if you feel like you want to propose something, go for it it um I feel that well let me ask this. I feel that we've had ample time to explore the differences between the different metadata privacy approaches to the point where we're approaching dimension returns and we should try to call the question Do other people feel like they need more time? to understand the metadata privacy approaches? If you feel like you need more time, come right in the chat, come to the queue No Okay. So I would like to get a sense of the room on whether people support the approach that's on the slide So I will write that up as a question in the tool, and we'll take the poll"

And my proposal was going to be that we pick those up again, either like end of August or beginning of September just because people tend to be on vacation and there's not a lot of attendance. What do people think about? that? We got some physical beginning of September just because people tend to be on vacation and there's not a lot of attendance what do people think about that we got some we got some physical thumbs up in the room and objections? Keep the same time on Wednesdays, whenever that time is in your time zone. Noon Eastern Okay And I think we could probably start well, let's see, let's see where we are, but we clearly have more discovery that's already teed up ready to go. But we can come back to the rest of the topics as they're ready to Was there anything else that people wanted to come back to? Anybody want to talk about file downloads some more? That was the other one we had left. Oh over. Or, I mean, we have 10 minutes Do you want to continue with Discovery or do people feel like they context switched? Done All right. Enjoy your lunch.
