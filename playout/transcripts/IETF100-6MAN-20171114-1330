    "text": "last comment Noreen\u0027s oh oh yeah I just wanted to say in the first case there is no gain because in in any large network the cost of sending the packet peer-to-peer and the cost of sending it sending it through the AP is pretty much identical except it\u0027s not always only about 99% of the time yeah I agree that it would would go from A to B through the access point at layer 2 but it wouldn\u0027t have to pop up to a layer 3 router at the access point it\u0027s the same box but it\u0027s a layer it\u0027s a protocol layer that you you don\u0027t have to go through ok I I think we have to continue this one on the list and I how many people have read this document and write so please you know please read it and comment on the list thanks Fred thank you so the last presentation of today Lynn please you have ten minutes yes I think I may not have time to complete the presentation I try to just try to give the high-level summary of the what we are doing so this is a new trap which is informational and it\u0027s about our recent research for the transport to support also higher boundaries and also low latency and so the our motivation is that the current network is it just the best on the best effort IP service and it influence transport a lot but we want to give IP level service with kind of qsr than to see what transport can behavior and the basic idea is that based on our analysis that\u0027s a lot of background analysis in the draft I think if you are interested you can cook it here and we try to have more involvement of network device from that transporter service and also we want to have a simpler protocol because we know that eyes will be kind of not deployed so we have this kind of design targets and the some talk is is just for the power ability and some tagless is for the network neutrality such as a lot last winter for network neutrality so because these cover a lot of area I don\u0027t want good details and next page please so conceptually we try to introduce us newer sub layer to support the transport we call this a transport control and what we want for this transfer control is that firstly is to in Venice England in Venice England on new its if it was proposed ten years ago by John Harper from Cisco that time it could come out "
