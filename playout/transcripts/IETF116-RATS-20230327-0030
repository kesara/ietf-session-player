If we're going working group last call, and this document looks simple as it kind of looks, we're gonna be really close to having the eye a review for that anyway when we go to It last fall. So why don't we kind of set a marker for ourselves, if we think this starts extending into you know, two, you know, one month or kind of two months, we can start talking early allocation, but I don't see that happening. Absolutely. Makes total sense yes. So So I think we can take the action as chairs then to do the working group last call. And then we make the assessment. Yep. Thank you. The other action maybe was to... I don't know Nancy, but if if someone could have a look at section one and make sure that we have addressed the... You know, we have sufficient request, I can I can take a look at that, but I mean, that's of the working group last call I Alright? Okay. Yes. I would request that, you know, the reviewers also Sure.

Starting with main things. So First, we added a new bill of materials tag called surprisingly, which tells the without any ambiguity what it should consider as the exact set of tags that are expected to be used for appraisal. The other thing we did was adding a couple of new conditional endorsement triples, one with simple semantics and another one with more complex set of roofs for matching cool series matching. But the... But the main thing here is that they both build on on the concept of a state environment that is a combo of an environment map which describes the Google target environment plus a measurement map that carries the state of the environment that evidence is supposed to match in order to associate the endorsed values. So typical example of this would be a certification endorsement. Where the x measurement map would contain the rev values for the for example, This is one possible application of the simple of the simple conditional endorsement. Next, please? Okay. See yeah.

The appraisal policy is a set of rules, you verify uses to evaluate and tester. And it talks about how to compare information about the current state against information about maybe desired or valid states. We have reference values, which is a set of values that's used in that appraisal. K? Some documents may have used the terms like known good value or golden measurements or not enough Values, but that are extra document did not use any of those because you could also have things like known bad values in addition know good values. Right? And so or maybe you're have ranges or whatever. We used a more generic term called reference values, which is just things that are used may not be comparison for equality.

That's an example of an list. Block list would be it must not be in say, Maybe here's the rev replication list of Certificates. Not one of the things in this list. Right? So again, it's multiple values there and you're doing a not in not in type of operation. Example would be to say upper and lower bounds on a range, like maybe time range or a version number range or something like that that says value one value two, I'm looking to see is it actually in between those is another example of an appraisal operation you could do. Okay. And so the appraisal list to say take some of those values and interpret them and run the actual comparison between the name equals pairs, And whatever it is that the reference values are encoding and using. I'll list block list some combination etcetera. So encoding the current state and coding a reference state have some semantic differences. Right? One is a statement of truth, the other one is a statement of somewhere in this range or not equal suit in the search or whatever. Okay. So that's current state versus desired state. Next slide, please. Okay. So ignore the colored stuff here and just we're now we'll start with this the black parts the same diagram before. And so I wanna add the red into it that says, okay. If we label what is current state and what is reference date, okay? Endorsements and evidence you can say are current state. Right? So the evidence is while, the following things between this device, the endorsements might be the manufacturer saying, here are some things that were too about that particular chip when it came out of the factory, you know, was this model number and it has properties and so on might be in the endorsements. Right. So it's a statement about current state about a particular instance. Okay."

Of course, those are two different roles up top, although in some cases, the same organization, say a chip vendor might be both an endorse and a reference value provider. Conceptually of two different roles with two different conceptual messages during two different types of samantha content. Okay. And in the blue is to say, what do we have in the working group filling in those. You remember we have a bow tie model where sometimes we have multiple things. Right? Whether it's in the working group and other standards bodies, in proprietary for of vendor specific and so on. And so certainly, evidence we've got eat in that category. Reference values, we've got c in that category, then when I first wrote it, I was putting question marks in what do we have for endorsements You saw on Thomas presentation. Right? He talked about how has, like, code Bomb if I remember the right term, you'd put that in where those question marks are up there. And there could be other things too. Remember the boat the the the bow time model, right? Says how do we actually categorize these things. K. And how many of them is the It ihs specifying versus specified any Tc or F or vendor specific, Like, what is Armed u and Psa, what does Intel do for S x, etcetera. So got a bunch of these formats. And so each format, you put on line, And so they have those you could think of those blue ones as being bad and maybe dot dot dot. Right? K? Go forward one. Okay. So this is the mean contribution is this slide and again ignore the blue labels at that at the top for the moment, because the main slide is the country. I think I originally had in the powerpoint point, there's build outs that those appear. But in the Powerpoint conversion, I just slapped on there. So Here's the main point. So your appraisal policy, and this is trying to put what verify your does and how to think about what an endorsement is and so on. Most of the content is basically this one slot here."

    "text": "The appraisal policy specifies the comparison rules. How do I compare a current state against against reference state. For any particular piece of current state or reference state, there might be multiple components. And so on the left, if you think about say a dice example, you might have the current state for the hardware, the current state firmware, the current state for the operating system, and so on, you have this notion of layers here. So like layer one layer two up to layer anne example and the rest architecture document would be like, hardware firmware Os is an example. Correct. And so that's what we think of as being evidence which like, in the in many cases, later one is of the hardware, it's immutable and it changed up from there certainly in a dice case. K? This is just an example here, but people from familiar with d will able to understand that there's multiple layers here. And so if you're using e, you might encode those with sub mods or whatever it is is just hey, here's the properties the hardware, it's properties of the firmware the property of the operating system and there could be any number of different layers here. When really on the right, when you have reference dates, you're gonna compare those against something. Says okay. Well, the reference dates from layer two have to be compared against the current state for layer two. K. And so sometimes there's claims that get used at multiple layers. Right? Some generic claims. And and so you say, well, I need to compare the value here against the current state at layer two because this is the correct set for the correct range at the allow list the block list for that claim at layer two. Okay? So the appraisal one is the one that does The matching there. Between those two. So that's why you kinda have symmetry between the left side and the right side, the appraisal policy does the matching there. Now we down at the bottom here. Right? This is where endorsements fit into the left side being it's a current state category, that says, typically, the the vendor will say when this cam off of the factory floor, here are the properties of that particular chip. Okay? Here's the the the It was some key, say, a private key or whatever that was baked into that chip or provision of the ship, and I'm signing the fact that that private key has is in a device that has the following property. Right?"

And if this was signed, like a dice sense, right in a dice sense, your current you know, you layer one might have a key that signs layer to the signs layer three and so on you get top can have three zero key the factories key, the sign, say the chips key. And so the right side you're saying, does it all change up to the trust anchor store? So what does the trust anchor store on the right? Okay? For the case of the key in layer zero, where your reference date over here for later zero, that's for your trust anchor store would be that says, okay. It has to chain up to say, you know, the Intel key or the Key or whatever it is. Okay? Example of a reference state comparison here. Okay. So it's just saying endorsements fit cleaning under the left side, you still need comparison rules as says an endorsement comes in, you're gonna compare that against reference values. K? Understand, because this this diagram here was not in architecture document. And this is what we're trying to make clear. What I'm trying to make clear, on behalf of all the discussions we have in the in the architecture document meetings. As where endorsements fit into the overall picture and the expectation here in the terms of terminology. K. That's the main contribution of the document. And and why I think it makes sense in my opinion as a working group document to augment the architecture in more detail specific to endorsements. Beyond that, then there's comments about security and considerations and applicability of different formats especially since we expect there to be and already are plenty of say vendors Civic formats and so on. How do we think about endorsement for a mask? There's already and endorsement formats out there not Etf from a number of different vendors and And so that's just normal. That was already true for in the evidence too. Okay. So in the, we mentioned we have each over on the top left, we have c on the top right, Next slide, please. Okay. So since our utterances says that we will develop secure solutions for evidence and endorsements and so on."

And security, there's an argument the complexity is the enemy of security. Right? Some of you probably quoted that yourself. Right? It says... Okay. You can do things are complex. It just means that you have a higher a attack surface and higher risk that you have to mitigate in other ways. Right? So there's a principle here it tries to argue that says Can you go back on slide for a second here? Independent of what format you're talking about, The comparison rules code in the middle In simplest, if everything on the left uses the same format. And everything and The right uses the same format. Right? You can imagine more complex that says, let's say zero one zero one one used one format, and layer two used a different format. My evidence processor is gonna be more complex and layers one through and I'll use the same format. K. In terms of code size, you know, how many different implementations are there? Chance of bugs and I got two implementations Okay. So go for. So just just an argument that says if you had the entire left side be the same format, It is less complex and hence less risk of security vol vulnerabilities then if you had multiple across the left side. And you can make the second argument at the right side as well. Okay. Just there's arguments. It's all the left side the simplest if I use the same format. An argument that says everything on the right side if it uses the same for. Right. And so for example, if you're using e for both evidence and endorsements, and that's less risk than using heat and something else. If you were using for both evidence and endorsements. K? Say, yep, that is less security risk than using a mix of them. The observation right now is that we have current working group drafts that do eat for one and current for the other one, and not the same for both.

If you're an eat person and so the point is when doing code and an implementation in an tester, or maybe from a vendor? Can you use the same one? That's the security consideration. K. But this is a question for the working group because if working group things on the left side and says you must use one, You must use the other. Then we're choosing to say, we're going to recommend something that has higher complex enhanced higher risk of securities laws. Okay. That's was what I trying trying to call out here.

That would be a fair alcohol outcome. Right. And I've heard at least one first arguing that. Okay?

When would you ever care about consuming endorsements on a cortex m? Okay. On a constrained node. An example, And there's a couple cases, like, I'm sure Thomas could think of another one. One case is a appraisal policy for attest station results. Which is not what I'm talking about here, but it's about case too.

And this is called out in the architecture document, is you can say, to verify before trusting them as a ver, If you have a tiny minimal embedded into the relying party that's only capable of verifying that one device and nothing else. K? Then all I have to do is I can test from the the relying party's minimum one, once I pass that one, I can use the ver for everybody else. Because I don't care about heterogeneity. I just care about the one manufacturer maybe it's my manufacturer so I can bake that into the firmware. Right. So in that case, I've got some things down here inside of line prairie that's as if there's a he'll firing in all those lines up there, might be coming in drawing party.

If I ever needed a pressure for them then the fewer parser the better it is for footprint. That's only consideration there. If you make them into of the firmware, no big deal, if you want post messages, then you care about how many different message, how many different formats are there and so that was other consideration.

In it's complex more complex, of course, but it's allows you to treat very many different things using the same base semantics for example, the idea of having an environment that these eight precise data type, you know, that can be used in subjects in three pools and object, and therefore, you can be a semantic web out of this things and, you know, create complex"

That of the tester? Where you have multiple testers within the same device is providing their own evidence. And another Another use case was that of a split appraisal that is typical in confidential scenarios where you have a platform evidence and a workload specific evidence and you normally split the verification where the platform recognition is done by you know, the vendor, very fire whereas the workload verification is done.

It makes makes sense to me to decent centralize that and put them in the working group that was actually defining, you know, what the relying party needs and what the claims are and so there's a e profile for keeping in the cheap working group as you know, and I'm saying that's what this and blogs rather than in a rat document.

The endorsement carries with it a lot of... Should carry with it implications or somehow indication or information about what level of trust. I mean, basically, what you would expect, you know, level of trust of from the evidence. For example, it could it could say an endorsement could mean you can trust every claim coming out of this device. Implicitly and you don't have to check them for... Against anything. You could you could say that. An endorsement could say, I'm only signing this thing with a key up in the the Linux application layer, so it's not very good. Endorsement could say, I'm... The the stuff that's coming out of here is made by an American manufacturer, not a, you know, don't know some from some other country.

To them to get to what it wants. Dave later or thank you. K. Taylor. Just to continue on the line of thought that Lawrence started. They're things that I would like to add into a future version of the document But I'm happy to play that until after adoption or whatever of an endorsement month because there's is the example I showed for endorsement where say the manufacturer sure is endorsing the chip is Yes, It's, you know, intel inside type of endorsement. With the following properties and what you can trust and so on. Is kind of what we usually think about. But there's more complex ways you can use them So for example, If the software manufacturer of layer two That's an Os or whatever. Wants to say, oh, yes. And here's some additional criteria that that suffers and say, but I can vote for the following things about that particular software and you have the sort of tree of multiple endorse as you have an endorse for layer zero that when that signs layer one, you also have a cassette set. So you can think of it as a set of additional sign to name value pairs is or additional sign claims from somebody else that you can choose to trust. And if you do, then they kind of augment the layers zero with the layer one or whatever with other things. K? So if you said, okay.

No. It's a set of name value pairs that could be appear at it a particular aware that's signed by some entity that better be in your trust anchor store or or you're not try endorsement. So that's the type of discussion, I think we could get into that would actually build out the concept of what an endorsement was in a way that might allow even more uses than we've talked about in the working group.

I can post the list, although if it gets adopted as a working group document, then my expectation within transition over into the working group in the working group organization github up and it would be there.
