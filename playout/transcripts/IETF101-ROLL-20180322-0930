Huff tends to slightly worse due to the load balancing issue we also count parent changes so you will see there\u0027s a lot of variability here that\u0027s a side effect of the very preliminary result but in this case as well our objective function is a bit more stable and deletes to fewer parent changes and we also can\u0027t from any di o--\u0027s who are so the idea here as well is that the number of Dao sent is an indication of how stable the network is so in this case we do one and we have some issues already so after discussing the whole idea we that we need to discuss how general we want our solution to be so a lot of things that moment are predefined so we you have gotten to a constant one idea would be to either keep it as it is or also keep a few bits in the metric to send also the data unit so packets are octet or whatever another issue is the time unit and that might also be a good idea to send it so you can express a wide range of very values for time period so the are you talking about packets per hour packets per minute packets per day whatever and one other issue is that we might assume that all nodes have the same forwarding capacity so that might not be very reasonable so we could normalize the PTR to a given capacity or you could send the max capacity as another field as well so obviously this has some network overhead as well and we also see that all nodes consume energy with the same rate so you already have the energy metal container which you count energy remaining until the end of the battery but I haven\u0027t seen something that actually counts the relative consumption so we can deduce that from the to some extent the how much energy is remain with you it might be more accurate we use and replace finally at the moment the packet transmission rate again it\u0027s it\u0027s derived from what we note what a note is forwarding in terms of traffic and it might be a good idea to because at the end what you care about is the whole path to the root so maybe that would be more interesting so do a cumulative version of this metric "
