And because of that, once that was realized, The only option was to then basically re adopt the document by the process. To avoid potential issues down the lawn with know, appeals and goodness knows what else could come out of that. So It's just a matter of following the process.

It basically says that all the downstream piece will do the same hash to select the the same umHP. And and basically, that, that basically, make sure that there is no traffic duplication whatsoever. What I'm missing here is, in MVP, you have different ways of, selecting the UmHP. Right? So you may have some inconsistencies, and and even in RFC, 6513, you have the entire section 9, that talks about, duplication and how to avoid it and all that. So what I would really like to see in the draft is, reference to that section on on the RFC. And and say if it if, you know, all of it applies, or there are some things that do not apply for some reason. That would be the first comment The, second comment that I have is in the, gateway section there is some text explaining how to when you go from VxLAN to, MVPN and TLS, there's some text about, what to do with the different route types. Right? For instance, the APMC AD routes, they stay within the same domain, right? They are relevant to the domain. They are not distributed between domains. But, what it caught my attention is that the SPMC AD routes it seems that they are redistributed Whereas, in my understanding, usually, the SPC80 routes are triggered by data. Itself, normally not by receiving a route. Right? So I was wondering if that creates any sort of limitations in the solution."

So So right now, I think we'll have to see which section you're talking about. But if I summarize your, two questions. So first thing is make sure that it is aligned with 651314. With respect to multi homing and selection. Even with FMC procedures, It has to be in alignment with 651314 If there is any change, we should be calling out clearly. In this document Okay. Yeah.

Of of ipv6 that went right over an ipv4 next top. And it was focused on Safi 1, when 129. And then this next draft at the bottom.

But a, but instead, before next up. Similar, parity to RSV in 1950 Next slide. So, this past summer after I TF117 after presenting it of we had a a a good discussion on on on the mailing list about why to combine the drafts and the reasons to combine the 4 drafts three drafts that were presented the original draft for, on the past on the previous slide, the V Four at Miller I Staffing.

Both drafts have the same concepts and some semantics of a single peering design eliminating other protocol purring, and it's it provides an alternative dual stacks both Safi's are also well as well as sensible to support all staff, you And then when the combined draft it provides a, combined up you know, single spot for the V Four V Six architectural vacation. So simplification over having multiple drafts So the the work group was all On July 27th, and we received consensus from the group on August 7th and then the chairs of the approval on August 17th. And then after which we've, worked on and getting the drafts combined, the drafts have been combined, and the uwig is trapped has been uploaded to, So the data tracker And now we're, we'd like to get, some feedback on it if folks get a chance to review the latest updated draft. Please review and provide comments on the mailing list Next slide. So just wanted to note that with this with the com combine of drafts. One of the benefits is that we in the proof of concept testing of the V Four MLRI overview 6 next hop in the as well before and arrive over V6 up to accept. So they're both both concepts. We're now able to test both in parallel. So That really helps, really having them both combined versus being serial. And next time."

So As part of discussing, this core plumbing issue, we had to come up with a name. You know, it was like what happens when you have a path attribute in BGP. That gets outside of the scope of where it's actually being used. And what happens when, you know, you do this and it it causes problems, or it's really still inappropriate disclosure. So anytime that we have stuff get outside of BGP, you know, words intended to be we're calling this or at least I'm calling this, you know, Beachbee Attribute Escape. Know, this is just my term. You know, we have to start somewhere. Important thing is this is not escape in the context of prisoner breaking out of jail, it's really closer to dog wandering off. You know, it's just not going where it's supposed to be because that's how the protocol actually works. And, you know, these are usually normal occurrences of the protocol doing what it's supposed to do. And, occasionally, it's due to configuration. Sometimes no configurations to be able to help you with these problems. Why did they write this document? Yeah. The Beach B RFCs are actually pretty clear about how things work. But sometimes the consequences of how things naturally work unfair. I've had in the other conversations during this IETF. Some people are confused about you know, how PGP actually does pass things around. You know, so intrinsic behaviors of EGP, you know, for when you're actually doing something new. Means, you know, it's like, what what does where it belongs means, you know, what what is the scoping of these things? And one of the common bits of feedback, you know, best authors have gotten from IDR, especially last, like, year and a half or so.

So what's the actual problem here? If you have no ground users in your network that are receiving beachy routes, that are features that are locally significant for some reason. That don't necessarily belong. Well, then potentially, if it's gotten out of scope, bad things could happen. Also, pick a couple examples and, you know, some of these examples are very particular to the work that's been done in this. So, for example, the prefix at work, was originally done here. You know, if it prefix said gets outside of a domain that is where it belongs, you potentially can have something trying to do SR style forwarding. Off to something that's, you know, for a network. You know, the attribute is escaped. Traffic is going the wrong place. This is a bad thing. Huddl and caps attributes. Another thing that, is near and dear to your heart you're throwing all sorts of interesting encapsulation information in this for your various, you know, use case is inside of this. Well, what happens if that is attached to a standard ipv54 unicast route, and it gets out to the internet and some other box far away. Sees this tunnel and caps and proceeds to send your traffic to 3 networks over. Probably not what you intended to happen. And sometimes this is exactly as boring as something that's an the community, you know, maybe you have no communities that got out where they're supposed to be. And they cause maybe wrong VPN behaviors. You know, this is a route target that was from, you know, one provider gets in 2nd provider.

They don't care about it, well, they'll pass it along anyway. The consequence is, you know, when things get where they don't belong and they're wrong, you know, originally before we made changes for 7606. Your session would drop.

And, the bigger problem was why did this thing even get out of the network in the first This is a local L3 VPN feature. Why? Did this season happen? Pick a different, feature. This one's largely worked on an IDR and has been a source of interesting hilarity among operators recently. Is the HP entry label feature. Okay. Know, Juniper published the thing in RFC 6790. It was basically boring. Hi. I support entropy label. And it had no scoping information on it. And very soon after, and Linda, I'll happily take questions after the presentation. After we actually, shipped the RFC, we realized it had a problem. You know, attribute escaped, and it meant that networks that didn't necessarily do entropy label at the right spots."

We put it in the same code point that entropy label was living in. Know, we call it effectively attributable to V2. And this now means that we have non inter about operable scenarios. So this was causing session resets, you know, and bad things if you don't have your handling turned on. So this is an entire chain of things that just simply shouldn't happen but it is a perfect example that when you have disagreeing path attributes, which can happen for all sorts of reasons, including help drafts that are in progress that you shipped version 1 of the thing and version 2 changes the format. This can cause anything from session resets to just simply, you know, bad handling of the dates where they get drawn.

Necessary feature. But it only belongs in a, you know, a very tight scope for an EVPN network. Unfortunately, you know, the original specification of the thing you know, as a consequence of these being L3VM routes, could escape out as ipv4 uricask as l3 VPNs talk to the internet sometimes. And we saw that some vendors actually had issues with route selection because Depat says if you have this thing, it's gonna change the order preference.

And this is the feedback getting consistently, you know, at this point from IVR. And, ideally, this becomes part of your review processes. L, you start discussing, you know, what sort of scoping do we tend to mean and mostly there's a small number of scopes that they tend to use in Beach beyond a regular basis. AS level scoping is very common. Yeah. We see that out of things like extended communities. And, problem is, you know, some things are more tightly scoped than that. You know, what happens if something is scoped to an top, like, for example, the entropy label work. We fix that inside of the next capability work that's going through IVR right now. And that's potentially a generic, you know, fix that we're going to have for this piece of the feature. Now we've added to the toolset. But sometimes tools can't help you. Some features have to be consistently deployed in the as, that route selection issues don't have you end up being with loops. Don't have a consistent mechanism for this things like making the attributes non transitive and capability scoped or address family scoped means that, consistent deployment may actually be a little bit easier to force or at least not cause you blow up.

Communities can contain sensitive information. Know, things like no telling information, redirect addresses, that sort of thing. Vendors do not have. And speaking as 1, consistent, easy to use cleanup procedures right now. The BCT documents, the best we have right now at some point. Ideally, our, you know, operators will push us to have more system mechanisms, and a thing I encourage you as a working group to think about for your explicit mechanisms as part of your cleanup and scrubbing procedures, you should have as part of your operational section Here's things that I expect to be cleaned up at my network boundary because they stop being relevant here. Give this advice, not only to yourselves, for your implementers to do something with, but for operators to know that you can safely filter these things. Sometimes we even have, you know, boring, you know, things like Large communities go too far? And, again, this is No. These are generic things. They don't have any specific magic circumstance. It's not a link bandwidth. It's not a route target. It's a magic number that in somebody else's network might do something bad. You know, again, see the DCP discussion that's happening and grow. 50. One of the big reasons to have this discussion is especially for those of you who've been paying attention to the news. Sometimes these things are not accidental. You can actually attach some of these things"

We don't wanna necessarily do indiscriminate filtering on things, because if you make operators throughout everybody's path attributes. Will never deploy a new feature ever again incrementally.

For all type of addresses, whether they are assigned with the HCP, a static stateless or to configure for v 6 and as far as v 6. It covers most link to calls and and global addresses. So this is just quick background on Savi. Next slide, please. So why do we need to hide the draft after all the enough RFCs on both sides to cover all these mechanisms. So the intent was really to break an ops draft because we thought it was worse explaining how this thought it 2 technologies would interact with each other. And in particular, it was important to explain that when you want to deploy study in a network like EVPR because you need to have that level of security. There's gonna be a price to pay. Depending on the type of addresses, actually, we have listed here that particular price. 1st come first serve. Realize if you remember, address is are only stored locally.

So for for the 1st 500 millisecond, the service will not be allowed in. And sometimes especially when the host is moving, that price is, unacceptable. For the HCP assigned addresses, the price to pay is different. If the address shows up somewhere where it's not known as a DHCP address, then the switch has put to the DHCP server with a list query, for instance, and that's going to create additional control traffic and and time. So worst explaining was really the first, step But then we said, well, maybe in an ADPN network, we can do better. And now the draft, that's why we have, this dash 01 explain how to do better, and that's the difference for me between in, interacting and integration. So that particular draft is covering point 12 how to do better, between 70 and EDPM for for first come to our serve. There's another draft which covers the point number 3, which is DHCP.

This may be, a topic that you wonder why I'm talking about that because TDM is old, but, with the scalability of ethernet and, routing silicon coming, 2 great highs. There's actually some cool things about actually carrying bit streams of a packet networks in the future. This is actually about a draft that we have started a while ago. I made a rookie mistake renaming it. Because I changed a little bit the contents, but, sometimes you learn new things the hard way. Next slide. Ali, did you Did you walk off with the something that I didn't. Okay. So signaling private line emulation suit wise, maybe let me remind you first what private line in Malaysia, student wise, arf. Those are essentially bitstream pseudo wires that allow you to take bits in encapsulate them into packets and send them across this is somewhat of an old hack we have done that for. Uh-uh TDM can channelize the Son of FTH, and we are now doing that for higher speed interfaces. For example, ethernet fiber channel and the likes. We have defined a bunch of payloads, and, we are using the co control word again. So, nothing revolutionary, but an evolution of what has been done in the past. And the draft got adopted by the Palace Working Group."

Today enterprise customers during datacenterinterconnect deployments are required to build not only network, but also a parallel network consisting of DWDM to interconnect storage and 5 channel switches. This is often a managed service and for some customers quite painful. If you actually have the ability to carry literally anything over a packet network, you now can interconnect your fiber channels, which is over your IPN Plus infrastructure. And with that, you could can get rid of the ex, the the extra network saving cost power, anthetics, Yeah. I come I come here, sir. So how could we signal those student wires? We have been defining, or actually not me, but, you guys long time ago, defined already extensions to LDP to signal things that are needed to ensure that for a midstream city while we we can ensure that we have the same pseudo wire type on both ends, that the attachments record type is the same. As well as the payload size there is a new requirement that we're bringing up because in TDM networks that generally is, something that is done is to ensure that you actually interconnect the 2 correct endpoints with your circuit. So in this document, we are proposing to extend the EVPN VPWS Machinery, to also carry the information that used to be carried in LDP. And I'm trying to put it somewhat side by side. And why I'm doing it side by side as well, I wanna show you that we're again, trying to reinvent the wheel, but we are trying to evolve what has been done in past and has been proven to be successful. To basically try to align that but change the the protocol or also provides the PGP, EVP, and VPWS protocol as an option to signal low pseudo virus."

Who is, the most recent contributor to the draft. Motivation, you know, a service 6 month architecture defines a 6 mobile user plane. For distributed mobility management. And basically what this architecture does is integrates mobile user plane with a service 6 data plane, and it does that by taking the is session information you get from mobility management and transforms it into the routing information. In. As part of this architecture, 2 new segment types are being defined called direct and into work. And then you've got a 2 new session transform routes. They are typically generated by the controllers. The segment types that have been defined are typically announced by PEs depending on where they sit in the network. So, the use cases are very"

The architecture type for this draft is being set to 3gpp5g. And it can be extensible all the route types that are defined ensures that they are compatible for the future versions as well. And you got about 4 new route types defined as part of the selfie. And like I said, this route types can be shared. 2 well known segments, are being defined and they are translated into 2 different routing instances. You've got an N3 RAN you've got an N60N. Entry rand typically connects between your genoedbs and your and then 60 n typically connects between U. P. F. And IP network. And essentially all the routing information that has been created as part of the segments is been redistributed inside the BGP. You have Gnode prefixes that are announced, and then you have prefixes for the map segments that have been announced as well, they have an associated attributes that have been listed here. Now, you got 2 New route types also defined. You have a type 1 route that basically is imported by N60 and instance. And it carries the UAE information.

You either configure it or you either announce it insight the selfie explicitly. Depending on the flex, way you wanna do it, it's quite flexible. One way or another, but you need to announce that information so that b g so that the routing can make use of it. Type 2 is typically imported by N3 Rand routing instance, and it carries the endpoint address, and the associated GTP tunnel information. The necessary attributes are also associated with it and you also carry BGP Xtad community that has been listed here. Over and above, you have route target, extend communities, that are there. To ensure that the routes are imported in their associated routing instances appropriately So that was a quick refresher. We now have version 3. Version 3 of the draft. Has following changes that are already incorporated from version 2 you've added n.m.gd4/6.e for the direct segment. And then the version 3 has an ocean for optional support of source address that will be carried in the type 1 SD route that I've talked about. Now from the draft perspective, it's in a pretty good shape. The version 3 has already been submitted. Multiple interoperable implementations exist both from vendors as well as from open source A major customer trials are also underway.

So the problem statement here is quite simple. Is whenever you're doing EVP and multi homing and the interfaces or L3 interface. So, we still need to support the load balancing. So, therefore, we need to be able to provide the synchronization of our tables like R And D Multicast, And, also sometimes, the IGP. So So now for the solution, well, it's it's based on all existing machinery. So, again, we are using choose for the R and D. 7 and 8 for the multicast. 5 is their you want to synchronize your verve table. And also, what is more special is that how you identify your interface whenever you do the synchronization. So therefore, we use the 3 work targets that will represent your verve. ESI is like for your interface. And we'd use the attachment circuit that will tell you to your VNN or subnet.
