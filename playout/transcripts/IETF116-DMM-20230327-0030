Also with Be specified in the past with... With packet core and today's five g system. All of them utilize the concept of a mobility anchor. So here in the terms, it's a little bit mixed. Sorry. I was lazy not did not update the figure. What you have is typically controlled plane vulnerability management. And then you have a mobility anchor, which can be your home agent in more Ip could be a local mobility anchor three p p terms, it could be a packet gateway or user plate function. So from the anchor point towards the mobile device, that's the mobility management system. And to your does not cover everything.

Another point is that today, it's reality that even three G user plane functions, mobility anchors become distributed. So they are not very much centralized and the mobile device keeps its originally assigned mobility to anchor forever, but there is more dynamic in such a system. And it's reality today that mobility and for mobile rights gets relocated mid session. So 3g has these modes in support and in Dm that was also discussed quite quite a long time ago. The objective during such a re location of a mobility anchor, mid session is to keep sessions and services continued to mobility and location. Different concepts utilizing forwarding from one angle to another one who can discuss. This is not about route up my optimization. So what we want to investigate again and look back is how we can steer traffic from application service towards the current active mobility anchor a mobile device. So this work is supposed to be independent of the mobility management system, whether this is mobile Ip or thirty But we look at or could look at solutions that work with any of these systems And well try to work out all these systems"

Even if the mobility anger is. It's instead debatable if Ip address continuity is spell or not, There are other solutions to tackle that. But we always conclude that there may be still value in maintaining a. At address. Mobile notes ip address. So if we show the mobility management system on the left hand side below the mobility control as a very small area because we don't plan to touch it. We don't wanna modify it. But we focus on the right hand side, which is the remaining segment in an end and you're between a mobility anchor and application service or a data metro. So whenever mobility management system decides to relocate anchor for mobile device. Wanna ship it's more anchored Ip address the new mobility inc, which may for sure, make the mobile node Ip address and non Ip address. So how can the mobility management system interact with a transport network control plane to steer the traffic in rolled opt us way between the traffic source, which is the service in the data network and the current mobility anchor.

And the actual mobility anchor that becomes relocated So that approach was particularly leveraging identify locator separation and makes use of address rewrite to bring the packet to the current anchor. Next one, please. There was another draft on N six traffic steering at that point in time, it utilizes already the reference point names from three Gp But I think in the meantime, the whole working group is aware of that. Nevertheless, it's the interface between the mobility anchor and the data network. And here The graph already addresses inter working between two control planes, which is transport network controller on the right side and the three control on the left side. So there is interaction needed. And on the data plane that itself, any kind of house routes or programmable transport network, data plane can be leveraged here. So the draft is not specific on that. But it tries to take the problem that we want to raise you. Next one. Another one, A couple of years back. Also tries to generalize the problem of steering traffic between the traffic source. Any kind of mobility anchor in the mobility management system making use of controlled plane, it's called mobility floating. So so all of these concepts still rely"

So these are draft which try to address the problem in a generalized way and we wanna bring this up again the awareness of the problem statement.

Interest is one thing, but there should also be value and documenting this. Maybe we find gaps that really require additional standardization of information more semantics on couple of related the interfaces. So is there value and relevance of such work. Is there a customer of these documents in case we produced them. Technical scope of the work, again referring to this architecture here, On the left hand side, we have any kind of mobility management system with the control green in a data plane, data airplane leverages mobility anchor concept.

Another point that could be looked at is... And there are plenty. Different control planes. So which control plane could be used to to make this use case happen. I'm pretty sure that there are plenty. So the question is, should all of them be listed analyzed or document I don't think we can propose one particular one which we standardized. So that's a big point and questions. So from a technical Scope... What should be the focus here? Third one could be the interface semantics between the transport control plane and the data plane and fourth So which forwarding claim could be used here compared analyze in terms of bring packets from source notes to mobility anchor. Last but not least, before we go to two questions is which could be the intended status and type of this document. Is this something like best practice informational drafts, whatever, alternatives we have and this is more an analysis or well we may conclude the document with gaps and then have standardization if there is anything to send incentivize in the next step.

Is it not just applying a steering rule on on the on the on the access router or router. Well, I think there are different solutions that could be looked at So actually, assuming we have policies on the end endpoints, like the Dp vpn here in the anchor for downing.

I'm concerned that we're still looking at a Gt. System here. And the truth is that for modern applications, the application layer deals with mobility. Across most multiple endpoints. What we're looking at here, I think his enhancements to the three p p network to maintain Gt and then distribute into the Ip network.

And it's certainly something that's come up on some of the six G links. Mailing list because we've been talking about the issues of connecting across multiple networks. For example, when I'm roaming, I have a different experience on a cellular of network to that on a wi network. Is there any way that we could look more at what the application wants to do rather than what the network is doing. And could we start to start removing some of the layer two that we've inherited from Gp. That exists in three p. And actually move to a true Network, which is Ip to end. Across this. I think that this is also well, again, multiple comments a single one. But So first of all, if we think about and and and see value in documenting something here.

No. So can we start stripping some of the three Gp stuff out and start making it into a an Ip end to end network. Again, we we plan to strip the three p work out of that because we assume between mobility anchor and mobile node, it's a mobility management system knowing how to deliver packets. Whether this is Gt or anything else? Or if this is a mobile Ip home, on agent and using Ip ip solution. Right? So you address another aspect which is that higher layers may be able to tackle that problem. And that's why we said let's think if there is still value in Ip address continuity because we have protocols that don't or vacations with the transport protocol that don't depend on Ip address. Right after So This problem originally addresses the point of Ip address continuity. So we wanna transparent an Ip address of a mobile note from one mobility anchor to another one, which makes it not rat in for rotting manner. Anymore. So we need to have post roads or whatever kind of scheme to deliver the package and roll up the mass weight. If we don't depend on Ip address continuity, there are more solutions cycling that with what what you just refer to. So that's also a question if we want to look at these schemes which is actually a little bit off topic from from what we wanna address here.

Here is such just some basic diagrams about okay, for the three Standard like use cases, and then you're going to have step network, either on access. Basically from the U and then go through the the G feed link and then go to mobile access G b is on is onboard satellite. The lower part is is the g still Itself is still on the ground, but the Ups is onboard satellite. These two diagrams I borrowed from another draft. I I I'm one of call authors. Can the next one.

Essentially, if you some background, So Fcc, the Cs eight working group is looking at solutions for supporting e nine one one or wifi. I think so this is the the charter for group is working group for mainly the topic is nine one service or Wifi one. The idea is that this working group is going to provide certain recommendations to council so that they can do rule making for... I think the larger goal is how can we Today, you know, how if you look at the nine calling, it's very well supported in cellular access. Right? Now in many environments, you know, a user may in a basement or in those environments. There's no to public connect for public cellular network. In such scenarios, how can the user make use of the Wi f network that is available quickly make an emergency nine on call. So that is the the larger group.

Now if you look at the three G defined procedures, device can latch on even even with an expired sim credentials. Or no Sim card. It can activate the emergency procedures and make a nine one on call. Now the question is Let's take the case where the device There's is no public sell network. All the devices wifi cable device, there's no cellular module. Such scenarios, Now if there's a wifi f network that is available, Can the device make use of the access network. And make the emergency nine on. I think that is the... So the scenario to... The middle scenario is what the focus of that of that working group. Like, how can we provide you know, can we come out with more mechanisms. Where the end endpoint can make use of the available network and and make the call. Now related a third scenario is again there's no public cellular network. But it's... The user device has some access to some. Maybe it's not a managed, but it is some... It has connectivity. Even then can it make the nine one on call? I think that we we by default thing that yeah, if there's a connectivity, I can make a nine one on call. But if you look at it carefully, the dialogue today that's in end point. The dialogue is somewhat... The default dial. Is seller module. Meaning, I cannot press nine one one, expect the call to terminate and I network. So the question is how can in both scenario two and three? What configuration we can provide to the end endpoint So that it can make a nine one on call. So these are the"

But There's not assumption that the device is pre configured with the default emergency pass point profile. So now I'm touching the elements. I think you know what The the proposal is about can we stand or at least, you know, make sure that this emergency passport profile That is configured in every endpoint. Think that is a rule making that we are asking. If Cc two say that, you know, there's a passport point past point is well supported across all the bicycle system. Can we can we define a special passport profile that's intended for emergency access. If that profile is within is comes maybe as part of the manufacturing process. Right? Apple samsung's by default, install that profile or as part of the carrier bundle they download it or maybe enterprise networks can push such a profile or a user may download such an emergency for file. Now I think the goal being we don't require new changes. New mechanism on end point. Because past point is well supported. Now if there is a passport point profile on nine point, now in the... If the Wi f red are mandated to support such passport point profiles. Make the call. Now the assumption is again, there's no cellular network for available. This is no Hp vp, There's no run available or Ims score. But what is available is an access network. It supports emergency, you know, access. Now in that device with latch on? Get the necessary you know, discard that network, by the way... I don't have access to this access network, but because it's an emergency call, Can I latch on to the network that's available with some hot spot public hotspot? And make that call.

You know, what is a new pass profile that if Cc can. The parameters rather. And then what regulatory framework that is required. I think the question is So there's also with liability. Nine one one, if you look at it eight eleven, it had some semantics for even ten fifteen years back. But you had no traction? The... I'll got in the method that was specified, nobody implemented. It's not there. And it's also note network support that. Because it's about a liability. Now the question is if an access network supports emergency passport profiles, can come and say, you know, you are not the liability. There's a call failure. We will step in and we'll protect you. So as part of that I think the oral overall discussion is also would what you know, what tools or, you know, what is a framework that we can define so that the access network was are not liable for any any issues around call failures use. And the third aspect is The location is fundamental. If I'm making a nine one one call, the emergency dispatch services should know that exactly. What I'm claiming for, The location that I'm claiming should be indeed the location that I'm making the call from. So mechanisms how do you full? Somehow the nine model on system, the operator should be able to know that... Yeah. This it is not a fake call. So... And the final... I think these are the two things signaling and the detecting of rogue these are the technical elements of the solution. Now I think that the mechanism what we are proposing is based on the open room framework. W has defined two small slides I'll pause questions. So This is all our system architecture.

And also, all there's no public network available in that in that environment? Gotcha. Okay. Yes. It's... I think it's related to the other problem, but what we've done is tied ourselves into a 3g p centric solution. Actually what we're looking at in terms of endpoint is a Sip endpoint. So my Ims client is sip. It's just that I have the authentication and the Ep g nonsense behind it. Yep. That ties me in. So for example, I'm here. At the moment, I'm on an Ihs network. At home. I'm on an Ep g from Vodafone. I vodafone don't allow me to use Wifi calling. I have to go through the roaming. So I'm on circuit switched effectively. I go to the Us. I have no two g no three g. I can't actually make a phone call at all. But I can make sick calls. I kinda make high. So I think the problem here... No. I do want to clarify one thing. Right? You make an assumption that your device is able to connect to the network that's available so what is it the connectivity programs, where how do I get think that is I think there's two problems. There's a connectivity problem. Yep. Which here is Wifi. Yep. There's also then a service problem.

Ought to be a similar concept within 5g forty five g to enable me to do that. Simply to get an on my peace session. That has known credentials that connects me Now in terms of location, we have a perfect location system. It's Ip. By knowing the Ip point address, knowing where I've attached, I know exactly where I'm located we should go in a public network. Now if you get to a private network such as a cellular operator. They hide that. I understand that. So so I think there's there's two problems. There's the architecture of three, which is holding us back. And then there's the fact of the connection of Everett already sort. But yes. It's it's an interesting problem. Because I think it actually is a wider a subset of the overall problem we've got in terms of 3g. No great comments. I think one thing I want to clarify, is the Ip address is not a representative of a the look the can see that you need need much more granular application I think that's one.

So despite the tristan turn the sofa far, the essence of P proposal is to session information into routing information. And this documents had simply focused on that. And this draft, it's meant to be information I'm document to describe the motivations to the dm m Six. P box. So we'd like to ask working group Thank you much. Thank you."

They can be classified into network based and host space this category, there are two classes for example. In the network based class, they are Pm ip And tensions and the other type is other kinds of network based protocols in the host based classes. Then there are many possible cases based on different camp and preference between host and network And the the question is should be selected when the host accesses is to the network and during the handover. Wait simply lists some principles for the protocol selection. For example in order to improve the efficiency and reduce the load on the terminal network based Pro should have hair priority priority. As andy scheme is needed all negotiate the capability and the preference between the terminal and the network. So where use the the the mobility pattern here because due to the an even space time, distribution of mobile mobility data traffic and frequent users switching in the 5g system The five to c network function still has the problem and and balanced load especially. When the use end user the five communication system, there user moves in between five g base stations, all different access networks.

I know many of the guys here are experts out 5g g and the way hope we can we can for the for design but it helps of function. So that's all.

I have I I haven't read the the documents so apologies for that, but based on your presentation, I miss a bit what is the idea scope for this work. I see not three but not aspects from what you have presented. Thanks. Can you speak? I didn't didn't catch the the main point of car I can just rephrase. So my my question is that what is the the scope of the relevance of what you have presented for Atf work. So I I I I don't see the link to It protocols from what you have presented. I see something that is one hundred percentage three be specific from what I understood. And I'm showing this many things. So that's why I'm asking what is the relation to to protocols.

So and and I know there are many details should be later. Tia tia? Ken Tri mobile here. I think this is interesting work But I I wrote want to you the authors to clarify about the... How you're going to use the stats from F. That is now on the fuck system itself. So if you can find I'm I'm also trying to think about staying along here. See, how can the rock to to give a way to map those information with the Id have domain. That is very interesting for the for the mobile management So I do think this is a good work for the the working group Dm ma'am. As far as, that one can be cloud. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

And just for you guys, maybe some of you are not, with what role working is doing so far that working group has been focusing on the general framework architecture and you cases and the specific mobility scenario mobility use case of feature has not been considered yet. So the goals of this document is basically to discuss what will be required to be done to enable mobility in raw scenario from the control plane point of view, And and then in our case with the define solution that is based on music. So basically, provide extends to implement this control plan extensions that we required to do mobility so the level contents of the document is what I Are show in the slide, So basically, we have first kind of the definition or the specification of the signaling inflow for well control mobility and for network control and very just basically the figure with changes. And then we specify the new extensions a couple of new messages and three new mobility options. And that basically proceed for current mission of the the draft only describes the Uv or the no node control mobility, but the control will be described in next of So this is basically simple scenario from of application.

You can see raw notes are well less nodes that are that from my network, where we want to ensure reliability availability, so this is kind of one that net kind of salary. And we also have a busy about competition element that is basically see completing the pass between the different node and then the Ps the reduction engine is taking the decisions on a per packet basis and a very much faster base basically get the the reliability availability required by an application. And we have a mobile note there. Really that is moving and it's at that or changing the point of attachment from one go note to another or. And then maybe be an external destination. In this case. Settlement. This is just an example. Of application, but any other type of application will also important. For commission support. So very quickly, this is the scenario that we define in the draft for Eu control mobility, So we have a Uv and mobile node on the left hand side. Is attached to Ronald, the old point of attachment this new point of attachments so basically I at the point of attachment word where would move there maybe other draw notes in the network. Of course, the Pc and then the external node correspond now we can call it in this case it's an server. So there may be an optional step where the mobile note maybe be getting information from the potential candidates point of attachment that can be used to the session attach to optional"

Assistant solutions for. And these message will include information for the way to basically communicate together with the new Po and keep prepare for the hanover basically people look. And in this specific case of role, that in involves this step number three rather competition where you need to communicate with pc get the the box available from the To the destination Ronald to get to the correspondence node. And once that that is obtained, we can signal back from the new P to In row h o Sdk and then the that is similar back to them. Mobile I now so that more note can actually start doing the layer to hand over to the new view. In our document, we also make optional to do at this point by casting to ensure to maximize the reliability of the delivery? And then In parallel, there will be the raw signal broad in running that may happen between the Ps to basically ensure that the will still provided a require level of availability.
