It provides transaction, it supports multi instance and in particular in highly dynamic dynamic and highly distributed service scenarios. And we outlined in the draft and and then in in case you have look through and documentation use cases, benefits, requirements, a possible solution sort to ground this into something of how you could do that.

We added a number of use coast six new use cases in total.

I also have that capture the exec slide We link to requirements to the use cases better, so that Requirements don't only read like requirements. They actually have references back and for to the actual use cases, which should help. We discuss possible benefits for the approach we are proposing and very few changes only in the actual more technical parts. They... Mentioned the possible solution. Just a couple of revisions to the figure, the messaging figure to make it better readable. We also added in reference to, what I mentioned before. Extended capabilities. If you had a base capability line what it is you you you you you could be doing on top of that. That's the new section eight.

So the right hand side. On the draft here is the all the highlights of the analysis which is now in section four. There is about the the the separation of application writing names spaces the additional discovery, it's mapping. We have some text on this. The the the Dna problem, which is a service and cost problem, not packet and it cost problem. When instances started more than one location the ep lifetime of an instance, so the shooting up of instances fairly quickly that's captured for instance, and the Based mobile application use case. Where instances may appear in that book cases really really fast. Dynamic dynamics service selection highly against selection as well as the latency budget that's very often an issue. And the dependency across service implications which leads later to discussions and section note on the capability of chaining for instance services. The key benefits are then pulled out of this in the section six which is the the support for the, of the service of decision, so that the decision you're taking the selection is very often highly dependent on what service you're looking at."

For lot of services, this solution makes no sense you're talking to your bank stick with the Dns, there's no reason to use rosa and there's not a lot of there. We don't assume that you're hopping between instances. When you do bank transactions. But for some of the services it's very, very useful higher service distribution or what mentioned, but even in particularly edge computing type of scenarios. And the protocol support which comes out of piece of work that's being referenced from Bt and others on a protocol suppose for automating the mapping of the name space onto to the communication name space. Okay. So the main id idea for those of you haven't actually read much on the technology side as I mentioned, it it replaces in those services, not generally. Not for every service. But for service that you decide to run over rosa, the Dns plus I peace sequence which is the off past discovery of a service name to the Ip locator with an on past discovery of the actual instance that you would like to choose. You sent an initial Ip packet. It's directed and this is put in their quotes because the actual destination address is still an Ip but it's directed to a service address and it's being sent to a special shi overlay. The sham mobile routes a packet based on the service outage, it makes a decision among one of the possibly many service instances that are being deployed in the network for the particular episodes being given in the packet, you may cross several Ip net networks when you do that, so it's inherently, you know, across the main. And uses mapping that we place the role of the Dns records if you will, but they're closer to actual routing table. Lookup ups. Actually, we use in an implementation Eb etf. With typical routing table. So there's actually a routing table if you will. And and and it gives you the actual service location, then it delivers"

So that's your your band discovery that I mentioned and now and then users for any subs sequin packets the service instance located directly. So the shi only routed the initial packet Everything else is shot directly between the Ip six of the line and and and the service instance. You repeat this for every service transaction. The service reductions highly delimited by the client. The client is the best to know what is the actual boundary of your transaction and transaction we mean is the semantic unit that lets you eat with a particular instance. But the transaction is over, you go back to step number one, and you may be directed to another instance. Of the same service because now you are in a new transaction, there's no ep state would between these two transactions, and you can be directed to another instance. If you are within a transaction, you just keep sending in step number four using the Ip six because you have a State, you should stick within instance and you shouldn't go out. The key point is the in impasse recovery is performed at Ip level. So that initial packet in number one has already payload of sort. For instance on your handshake for transport security Right? Could be in the first packet already. The service response has payload as well. On then keeps sending. So that's the where the aspect of in inbound discovery comes and so I have to wait for my of my errors to come back. Okay. All. Skip this part the recap movie either. There in the slides, you can look through it, There's short summary of what section that's now moved to section eight, I believe. It's given so it's layer three point five.

And the routing table sizes is limited by those service being announced to the rosa domain, however, so you may have very very specialized wrote the overlays for instance in some of our use cases to gaming or computing. Ask, you know how many edge competing services and operator would like to support maybe a few hundred and we've run this already in so a million service at no problem in terms of performance. So the routing tables here are relatively small. We're not talking about routing on every possible name in the internet. That's a very, very a good problem. It's not the same thing here. It doesn't require client awareness client consent to any address if that address happens to not be in the domain, we have a mechanism explained to the process of how this goes out in the Internet. Right and it uses traditional dns to do that. A possible extension skipping that's actually so previous one with section seven we change the sections so much never forgot the second. Section eight is the news section we added. What is it you could do if you had a base capability? So what's the squad in the section before? You could use different names space coatings.

To be a trusted so so when you think about using this internet context Bg, what are aspects that come from Dc. And if you're familiar with Dc, it has three key parts that that excite people. One is the update latency, how does does it really take to propagate updates to the distributed state in a Dc obviously from a network function from a usage perspective that's really, really important. If I wanna back up to a routing table and it takes forty the minutes to propagate that. There's a bit of a mismatch there. Right?

Right and change your stuff around. Working in consistent state. This is more related to the proofs actually. So that's third parties is. We are possible on this it maybe of interested in a book community as well to the routing mode we what could be network solutions that could help address some of those challenges.

Cast the computer where the relatively you work on computer awareness, It could this be helpful. We have also there a placeholder holder for lisp. That's something we still wanna fill up in the future. It's a bit of background for those you don't note Dc or or blockchain too march. Smart smart contracts here you use as a term to describe programs realize in operations in this case, our context here is B so Related operations is to store the state in the Dc.

Everybody assumes the doing stuff over network, you don't have to care what you're doing. Actually, you should you if you investigate ethereum fence work, which is what we're doing in this paper, it sounds quite scary of what's happening. It's a very, very significant communication cost that's being put on a provider in book that's all fine if you're okay with it, but it's good to understand it. I'm not judging that you shouldn't be doing it, but you should understand what you're doing. Right?

Relevant solution again this is routing working group, so we said about there be something around in the routing area that could be relevant for this the rosa was presented before. So what we've looked at the interpreted dc as a service environment This is not usually how the code is being written, but you you you can really find it that way. You have an insertion service as a diffusion service and a query service for those of you who know how work. And could you use an any enhanced a diffusion mechanism that is more network oriented in order to address some of the latency in cost issues that we identified in in the section. Things on ability and availability, which are the real real trouble makers in a peer to peer realization, because you don't really quite no if you know this day and if you notice there, maybe behind a firewall. All of this is a lot of methods that are being employed and current... The Dc are all geared towards solving that problem could be solved differently and more efficient if you actually would do things like routing announcements and aggregation. That's what we outlined there. Computer by traffic could you actually accelerate fusion by complementing the routing approach by to in a computer awareness of instance to less loader or well connected peers that's a bit quite debatable because it it also runs to an extent counter to what you actually want diffuse you want to diffuse it to everybody in the system and not buys it by by method.

So if congestion is detected on an outgoing interface, of a node that node also serves as the ingress for any local repairs that need to be done for that outgoing interface. So it'd be action taken by the point of local repair. Not by any upstream notes. Oh, so basically, you monitor the outgoing interface not incoming interface, and then you take action.

I think in an end to end cases, the backup tunnels that are pre pre established and our engineered, so it is better to switch over to those. Rather than doing Anyway, answered my question. Thanks. Yep. Yeah. Please be brief. Okay. For Huawei, my question is that I'm not sure. I understand that this"

I'm not a hundred percent sure. I understand the question. Are you asking Will this cause out of order packets? Yeah. I'm that's a you called you... You say you because the parcel is a change. But you know that picking the the packet that you you forward order but because of the past changes, so that is maybe out of order. I'm yeah. So I mean, typical no hash across equal multi pass does you know, it is flow based. So because we're not randomly spraying traffic across the Ec p that we've created but continuing to do flow based hash. I don't believe there'd be any packet reorder problems. More significant issue you is that you're going to have a delay change and that may trigger slow start So there is performance impact Okay. I'll be quick and from my side, as participant. You know, there's technology called adaptive priority and d be it's somewhat similar. It looks into occupancy of outgoing q and traffic It suffered a lot because of its locality.

Please speak. Thank you. Mister K. First to comment the question about the terminology you used. The mechanism that you described doesn't seem to be failure detection. It's more modification.
