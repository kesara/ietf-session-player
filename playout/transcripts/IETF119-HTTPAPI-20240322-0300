The first few slides are boiler plate. Should have seen them all before. The note well, If you have privacy or intellectual property about these kinds of things. You need to disclose it. One way or another, or please sleep the room. The note really well, treat each other with respect courtesy, if you have to commenting negatively on something, make sure it's clear that you were talking about the technology or the tech get the technology of the proposal, not the person presenting it, Yeah. If you want Slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Send them to me. I can take it. I have to fix again. Again, you should have all seen this before. Meeting tips. Those remote probably can't hear me anyhow. If you're in person, we will use the queue but it's a small room, and there's not a lot of people.

The the status of the current documents. Some of them I prepared the slides on all of them. On Pardon me, or an incorporated slide we got from one of the speakers.

Now that data model happens to be easily serializable elsewhere like XML and Jason, but wish at that and see what it looks like. Okay. can I I the the idea of thinking about it and writing down some issues before this gussing it, Whether or not that's novel in the IATF community, it is something to be commented? We wanna blaze trails here. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I and I think maybe the the latent issue there is that the should field's data model is Shall we say highly specialized based on the history of how HTTP headers have been developed. And so it's a little bit ugly, but we're trying to make it a little prettier. So we'll see. I did read the the latest update, Mark. And your comment around the data model, interesting one you were concerned about the fact that Jason supports. I've the ability to have deeply nested stuff, but Like, it almost feels the nature of being able to have Links that have formats, formats that can then have links, zoom. 8 8 it's it's just feels like you're not gonna be able to get away from the potential of deeply nested stuff. I think it depends on, you know, what the use cases or link hints are if if we want to turn an entire description of of an API into a a hint, yeah, that's not gonna be suitable.

Despite the what working group's best efforts, link link link relations still are used in in in HTML. I mean, to be fair. They have their own system for this, but I would like it to be serializable. So that, you know, We're trying to converge those 2 systems rather than create wedges between them. So we need to look at that and make sure that it's it's sensible in the HTML world. When Could Have you looked at or would you consider putting limits you know, it can be in JSON, but it better not be more than 2 levels deep. That kind of deal, or is that too clunky? Well, I mean, you would immediately face the question of how you would serialize that in an HTTP header. Fair enough. Yep. You know, is a well known little minefield. K.

No, and and the most recent revision, I believe, Roberto Split, open API because I think a lot of the challenges were around Jason's schema and, dealing with fragment in Jason's schema. And, we've the only blocking issue around the open API specification was security considerations. There is now a security considerations doc that has been written in the open API our repo. So we have something to reference there. The only other issue that is a question is at the moment, the media type registration suggests creating Open API application slash open API plus Jason, and application slash open API plus yamal but it doesn't suggest registering application slash Open API. And, that Especially because of all the conversations going on about multiple suffixes and the processing and multiple suffixes I'm Sort of feeling like we should Register application slash just open API. Which will assume that it is which can process by a YAML processor. Because Jason is a subset of Yamal And so if you if you receive applications slash open API, you can just throw it into a a animal processor, and it'll work regardless of what you get."

This is much less work has many fewer issues. Should just be since we've done the the big one, which is we're not gonna attack a whole life cycle of APIs. We're just gonna be able to indicate to a client. This API is going to go away in a time frame.

And then also resumable uploads is interested in a feature almost exactly like this. But, Would prefer, to not have to parse a new media type. It would you know, for efficiency purposes or whatever, maybe baking that into the protocol or minting a header that must be red, and, that would also have to be separately looked at To make sure that The server doesn't misaccept the request when It would not be understood or You know what I mean?

It's the one of the goals or the, like, especially frozen block loads, one of the ideals would be that we don't have to we, like, pars anything from the request to body. The request to body just is a content that's going to be appended to the document or overriding the document and then any of the other metadata that specifies where in the document that goes that would be part of an HTTP header or something that's actually already the HTTP syntax, that would definitely be probably more of an HTTP biz or working group question. Rather than APIs, And that would require some thinking about making sure that the server rejects requests if it doesn't support that functionality.
