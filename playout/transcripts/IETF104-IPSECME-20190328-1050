    "text": "even Ethernet right that no IPSec right for the small packet payload sizes we\u0027re batter right because we have less overhead because we can pack a bunch of small IP packets into 100 into one over and kept sliding header the other thing to look at is latency so this shows the latency they seem very similar between the current available and the TFS but the difference is that this is represents the maximum latency for IP TFS whereas in it sort of represents the minimal minimum latency for ESP you can go a lot deeper into this right because if you start looking at queues you can imagine if you\u0027re if you\u0027re patting 40 byte TCP packets into 1,500 byte ESP right and then you have ten of those in a queue right that\u0027s a huge amount of latency you\u0027re adding to that last 40 byte packet so we there\u0027s some related work that\u0027s going on in the I Triple E with regards to this they just met recently and it looked really promising there\u0027s gonna be there\u0027s progress on this and it\u0027s anticipated in upcoming meetings well and I also wrote some code that\u0027s available at that link now this is just proof of concept code it doesn\u0027t actually it\u0027s not actually an ESP because that\u0027s hard to sort of whip together quickly so I used UDP but basically what this is proving is the is the framing the packing and the the you know fragmenting and aggregating of the payload packets as well as being able to adjust to congestion so it does actually simulate congestion and drops and you know shows that it can adjust to that using the information that we have in the draft that we plan to update as well there\u0027s two implementations Python and C I out of time but I think I sort of covered the open [Music] and so on so to sacrifice some "

    "text": "performance in simplicity so I dress it to put the IP packets into HP but make make it you make it to combine several I see what you\u0027re saying so it will affect the nice numbers but yeah so why don\u0027t we Paul quick because we\u0027re over time yeah okay poets um so I think that that discussin should be doing two things one of them is sort of providing privacy in the other one is sort of compressing very small packets into bigger packets and saying those are two very different goals and for the first gold of privacy that the RFC you quote about ESP allows you to not only do padding but also some dummy packets so so from a privacy point of view the existing RFC already covers everything you would want to make a stream look like you know a similar mana monotone stream so I think like then maybe clarify bit why you want to do these other things that are like additionally complicated because I think that\u0027s foot but we had a real work in this track for years sure yeah I mean I the 22,000 percent overhead with someone one of the reasons right but go ahead Lou if you have a loo burger my understanding is from implementations that have actually tried to do the existing RFC it basically isn\u0027t deployable that it translates into what looks like a variable lost link because of the expansion you know if you think about a normal packet distribution well we used to be bimodal really trimodal most of the bandwidth is in big packets but most of the packets are little small ones and we end up just destroying the available bandwidth because of the expansion so well he\u0027s not listening but but you know the existing RFC it doesn\u0027t work that\u0027s the problem that it\u0027s trying to be addressed here all right so thanks we\u0027ll take the rest of the lists and that concludes IP second me for this week thank you if you need to sign the blue sheets please come up to the table [Music] "
