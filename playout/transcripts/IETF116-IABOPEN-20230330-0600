So what is the Ia open now that you're here? The Iv is, you know, organized this session for the past couple of years. And we really try and focus on two things technical and architectural topics, and then we do have presentations frequently recently about other standards organizations and what they are up to. And our goal is to increase the visibility of the Where as a whole and then to collect community feedback in input. In other words, we want to hear from you. So we look forward to your discussions at the microphones. Related to anything in today's topics. How do you reach us? We do have a mailing list. I think most people probably know. It's dot org for anything that you need to comment to us about. Note that the mailing list is not just the Id members. There's a list there that I'm not gonna read, but there's a fair amount of other people that are on the Ib as well. We are fairly open in our communication. If you want to be on a mailing list where you can discuss architecture things and Ie documents and things like that. That would be architecture discuss. Which is an open mailing list that anybody can join. We also have a group of liaison liaison coordinators that are responsible for helping with the Liaison liaison management to all the other standards organizations of which we have an official relationship to. And you can reach us by mailing Liaison on dash coordination at I dot org."

There's two right now in the R editor queue that includes the path signals collaboration document and the Ia protocol maintenance document. Both of those were recently put into past Ivy review. We have adopted another one recently about Id privacy partitioning, which is an interesting document. I encourage everybody to read. And then we're currently considering one about data mini immunization principles and feedback on that, of course, is always welcome as well on the architecture discussed list. There's two new documents. There is a recent report on the Ib workshop on the management techniques for encrypted networks that just finished. It was a fantastic work up and there was another one on the Id workshop on environmental impact of Internet locations and systems, which was another fantastic workshop that. I unfortunately could afflicted with, but I watched it later, and it's very good. So next up, we're gonna do a little bit on technical program updates.

And I've kind of had this position is the liaison manager longer than I care to admit, and and I think that's almost been two decades. So I'm gonna go through the the liaison unrealistic the liaison relationship between the I and the and the broadband form. So go ahead and hit the select. So just some history and background who's people think the broadband form is the follow on from the Dsl form and that's That is true. It is. It actually stems back all the way to the early nineties from the Eighty cell form. On the other side, around two thousand nine, they did a merger with what used to be an of the really form the mp form in the Atm form. So this kinda gives you a feel for the combined history that the group now has. And so you you would not naturally start to see some of the interest levels and some of the work going on. Here. I mean, the the the from the frame William and Mp Atm There's been a lot of Mp related pals P three related interest from the Dsl form, obviously, A just aggregated or broadband network gateways kind of stuff and also the residential gateway.

Basically, the relationship is managed between the actual liaison liaison zones that are exchanged between the two groups coordination between mutual participants of the two groups Yours truly, the liaison manager to the Bb behalf and the B liaison on officer, which I'll come back to. So again, it's light, it's easy and it's been working for quite a long time. The one thing I need to stress about the relationship is that the two organizations are very different from each other. The I ihs is open public the B f is not. It is a membership consortium, the members our companies. And is a membership court Consortium it actually actually has a confidentiality cross on its membership agreement. Which means all the work in progress kept confidential to its membership. What that means to the Is that there's should be no working progress of the Bb just shared a distributed it around the Unless it came from Ali on from the Bb. Once it comes here, Sky's limit, we can post it anywhere we need to. We probably wanna keep that related or or confined to facility, but no they understand that by lia things to the I etf, it actually becomes part of the I cap materials. Okay. Then the coordination itself, there are no I I kinda stole these slides from Russ H who did the ie triple coordination. We don't have tele conferences except on rare occasions.

So the statements and the managers, the liaison managers, of course, I just mentioned I'm the Liaison manager between the Ihs and the Bb. I also happen to be the Liaison liaison officer from between the Bb. And the I app. So I talked to myself a lot. Seriously... I mean, it's bidirectional and it's pretty lightweight. It's easy to coordinate between the two roles because I just switch brain sides. And one thing I need to stress though is that no matter which side I'm representing it's fair. Right? There's no bias here. I've got just as much allegiance to one is the other for the two decades that I've been working with both groups. So generally, a lot of the topics and issues come down to process. And I'm very familiar with both. Groups and the process on both sides and try to stick to very set of, you know, what I would call mantra So if you if you're over in the Bb behalf, you'll hear me say if people wanna change an It ihs protocol. You know, the mantra is no. You go to the Ihs and you you changed the protocol in the Ig according to the Ihs process.

The other thing we need to stress is statements. We've had some issues in the past on people coming into one group or the other and making assertion that for example, the B is taking the direction or the Ie etf is you know, fond of this work or promoting this work. One thing I try to stress is in a in a written more from the Bp point of view because I've seen it more for in the Etf related to Pdf work is any statements that you hear verbal otherwise, representing the Bb f work court's direction or agreements, the organization itself. Anything here people say about the Bb on behalf of the Bb must be supported by a written liaison. If it's not it's a fig of their imagination. I mean, So seriously, if it's not, it may not be credible. And it needs to be validated. And the only way to validate it is to come talk to yours truly, and I will make a determination usually, there'll be some liaison on a process and it's fine. Sometimes this happens inadvertently. Sometimes not. But it's really important. I mean, there's been issues in the past where folks have made as assertion in the middle of a working group meeting about Bb taking a direction to justify support of a draft or adoption of a draft.

That's the Bb process. When the Ihs makes a a document makes a reference to a Bb registry the reference should be checked before Last call. Okay? This is kind of the meat of the situation of where we are right now. This is a snapshot. So the work that's a mutual interest today. This could change tomorrow, but today, it's around...

Like many of the things that we've been working on such as video video conferencing our I'm actually quite helpful for for the environment. Toilets did a nice nice draft from that go read that paper and and and the draft if you're interested in in the more list. And of course, these are"

Like, if you make it, you know, change this route thing here, maybe it impacts T or, you know, some other feature. For the applications, and maybe that actually implies that then the let's say, video video conferencing. Doesn't work as well, and then, you know, I'm gonna travel in instead of use the conference. And so it's it's sort of complicated picture. And we do need to look at sort of Beyond protocols I mentioned the implementation section sample, we do need to look at metrics, measurements and data and running those experiments also not just like the technology for the experiments but actual experiments. We need more dynamic ability to sleep Tv r, the new routing thing area working group one one small example of that. We talked about data format mat choices, sort about the, it's might be applicable. We talked about lots of other things avoiding proof of work crypto assets. Mats had a paper about that. And we also had a chat about environment that considerations sections in I Atf drafts and didn't actually conclude that discussion. It's an important to bit to consider nevertheless. Anyway, quick class through couple of things. So also in addition to this thing that I mentioned earlier, he also looked at Trying to narrow the footprint tier two footprint of the Internet and, you know, came up with some numbers between point five percent and one point seven percent and that that... That's his opinion, but but the... Actually, it's quite interesting because there's a like lots of variety of things that when when you read other work, Next slide, maybe. We also looked at all kinds of measurements that like what's happening with the growth of things and from different perspective first one is from each ruler."

We looked also at this from the perspective like, where is it with or with what it is correlated? Too. And jens Small had a presentation about access network operators in Europe and how their electricity usage is relatively relatively flat regardless of, like, how much data usage actually growing as is growing. And finally David Sheen, had a talk about how like if if you assume that the energy consumption is actually proportional to, like, you know, how how large piece of equipment you have and when you have to upgrade, like, it's the the peak of the demand curve is actually dictating when you have to create a bigger device and then that actually brings along with it, some some more energy consumption and that can be bad. Of course, it's a complicated thing because Techno can also change and can you shut down part of your device even if if you have a lot of capacity. Next slide? And Carlos talked about how we actually need to optimize for throughput, but also about bunch of other parameters including energy efficiency, and you might be going like, first of his visibility about you might wanna end up in a state where you have some kind of automatic self optimization. Next slide? And one one one more example is about data formats So this was an example done specifically about cinema in iot systems and where you can"

And, you know, not surprisingly, you actually use less bytes and less energy if you use the more compact format and the So the less than the four for us, I guess is that we should consider using some of these things in other as well, like it's too, I guess is is binary format compared to some of the other previous versions But but that for new product protocols, this is a thing to potentially consider. And I think I'm done, I guess, at least from my perspective the interesting thing for this room to discuss is what can the Do and what other immediate short term next steps that would be most worthwhile for us to move forward on this. And there's no silver bullet blood, but we can make an impact every year then that would be good. Right. Thank you very much, Jerry. And thank you to both of our speakers for the energy related Topics tonight. We would like to take any comments or questions related to either of the two topics if you want to put your name in the queue and come to the microphone. I think that, you know, this is certainly an area where the can use a lot of discussion interestingly enough. We've had many discussions for a long time about travel and all the other stuff, but the the the ramifications of e impacts on actual protocols and things like that or have not been discussed quite as much. Brian. Go ahead. So I was Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. Good whatever. I was waiting for somebody else to put their name in the queue. So I could collect my thoughts. But nobody else did, so this is going to be slightly rambling please feel free to just shut off my video at any time. So I was I'm very sad to not be able to"

Because I would like to participate in in the following I have opinions here. It seems to me from the from the... Actually, could you go back? One slide. Because I think right for Yeah. Because it seems me that that a lot of the problem here is actually that sort of venn diagram of what to optimize for. Right? Like, we have this for anything when we're actually talking about bringing energy efficiency or sustainability in the second order right like, so, you know, maybe you don't wanna create a whole bunch of waste with the the upgrade cycle that is implied by by the protocols in the growth the code, etcetera etcetera etcetera rate. We're adding another set of dimensions to optimize for. And that's why I think one of the things that I saw in the the workshop report is lots of questions. Lots of sort of, like, expansion of the problem space and I think that's phase that we're in right now, I think that's really good. Not really much. In terms of contraction. Right? Like, so it's like, we're getting to terms of how much bigger this makes the problem space. So I definitely think that this is something that the the Should be considering with respect to protocol development. Right? Like, this is a this is an important important knob that we can give people who deploy our protocols it's important to consider the the the impacts of the physical infrastructure that is implied by the protocol. I I don't know that that's gonna be anything other than like talking and coming to terms with the problem thing for a while. And that's probably okay. So"

    "text": "I think what I'm asking for Is an Ib program in this space? But I'm not sure yet. So I'll all that rich for a bit on that. I I think that that's... I think that we need a place to talk about this in a place to continue talking about this. Sounds like you already has an opinion. Yeah. Thank you. Either one of our speakers you're welcome to come up it's always have an opinion. So to for forgot say one thing is that we also have been having this site meeting just actually before this this meeting where we were talking exactly about what you were basically. Raising that we're sort of expanding and this space is huge so we... Maybe we can't actually do all of it and we... Like there was feeling from many people that know. Well, maybe now it's time to narrow down on on the short term achievable things. And how do we actually go about that? Is this like a buff and happen to be talking to millions. It's suggested that maybe this could be an Program also and I guess, there's multiple multiple options. Of course, one constraint here is that like this there's probably like things on many areas. So this isn't like one working group. If you actually do an update on, you know, this or that, then it could be multiple working trips. And I think that the... Like the role of the of the Ia here can be sort of as a coordinator role. Right? Like, that's that's what programs are good for. I think. So so my opinion that this is an Iv program is being strengthened by this conversation. Maybe so I think the Ip program would be trying to identify concrete things we can do in the native and then hand it over to the Idea. Absolutely. Yeah. That's the... That's that's the model when programs are good. This is is. The reason why I didn't touch on the particular concrete complete technology She find what I did was, basically, the architectural concept of the Internet is quite important apply to the energy industry."

That's reason why I put what's gonna happen when we have innovation, you know, innovative infrastructure and technologies, especially that's going to the photon. Quantum So what kind of act difference gonna be changed in public core? That's an interesting thing. Yeah. There's a there's a whole new topic. Rich. Yes. Anybody else that wants any questions related to the Iv open session you're welcome to join the queue beyond just we only have about six minutes left Okay. Well we won't get an answer on this one. But as someone who like helps spec protocols and formats. It seems that a really simple question to. That would be great to answer, but I think it might be una is how much does it cost in carbon or whatever? To compute something here versus sending it over there. And so if we could just build a simple economic model of all of the Internet transport, and all of the Internet computations or maybe, you know, I'm exaggerating. But I think it would be really interesting set of trade offs. Right? Because we talk a lot about Oh, well, this is a better data for because it's fewer bytes on the wire. But there might be Cpu costs. That we're incurring and knowing when and how to make those getting some informed data about how to make those trade offs could be very interesting, but I have absolutely no idea how to do it. Yeah. That is a quite important point, How much cost will send the data the computation. Yeah. Plus latency requirement. Right. I mean, we think it's... We've already sort of figured out that it's better to do it at the edge whatever that means."

Just to kinda air what was it in the chat room as Hiro was presenting, I thought, well now Yeah. Three d printing is probably a lot cheaper you know, remotely then you know, moving the things around, but boy, what are the implications of moving the raw materials to do that three d printing and And do does that mean that mining is gonna happen in interesting places that might be more expensive either monet energy wise side, and then I'm looking at this that Brian had you put up and I thought oh, those sure look like knobs to turn where turning the energy should see now might change a latency and throughput knobs a lot and I just feel like the calculations here get really interesting and hit really fast. I always love the example of maybe the highest throughput is taking a bunch of thumb drives and and putting them in the back of a truck and moving them cross town. So Yeah. It it seems really hard to calculate this. I'm sure this super hard. Just like one sort of optimistic. Do view want this, like, that that it's not the case that we always they create the other parameters by, you know, making the energy efficiency better, it can actually be a win win in in some cases at certainly been true, like, you know, you introduced new technology and who suddenly you are faster and more energy conservative."

I want to optimize the net network. I'm not real regarding in three d printers you used thing. We really need those kind of what kind of abnormal use? Gonna do. That is our business. David here. Has there there been any analysis done on the Roi based on like, the different phases, the life cycle or supply chain. Because you're talking about, like having Ia scope out somewhere can handed or to the It, but then still, if you look at the whole supply chain it's not just the, it's you're gonna... You're talking about how vendors are manufacturing things, what materials are using Now of course, the protocols could expose those things and then there's some work could do, but still there's like, some coordination, you can say like, okay. This is how much benefit Could bring about to political work, but that's just say, like, twenty percent of this slice of the pie, and we need collaboration with other standards bodies or other vendors bodies in order to achieve the the remaining eighty percent of the whole life cycle. Any kind of like now has been done there. Real quick answer. I I don't think there's the full analysis anywhere. But you know, things of this nature have been brought up large instance brought up in the side meeting that one has to be careful that the embedded cost in equipment that's on doesn't come much larger because we keep replacing the the system components all the time because we had supposedly improved energy efficiency. So there are lot lots of traders and connections here?"

But that is Otherwise, we couldn't control them. original idea of internet itself, How we make a inter amount different equipments increments. Yeah. Just make a quick comment. Like so look, to rich point, there's like, a whole set of trade offs in this space. Right? Like, so for example, like, multi cars came up with something that can save energy, But like then, there's other set of people for whom multi has waste a lot of energy this is like, there's no easy answer here. So same for, like, David's fine. Right? And pete's find us all. Like, this thing is like a whole bunch of trade and one of her goals might be to just like documents such trade offs in some place. And so that's kind of a necessary condition for the assembly conservation section. So how can we help people look at the sustainability costs at the decisions they are making and if you look at the papers, David, like, specifically, there's, like, some that talk about we can have, like, something that's less optimized for today, but has a longer life times or or the lifetime it becomes like something that's like, more efficient. Right? So that there's, like, a lot more content on the papers than, like, that's in the report. So it'll be great if you can actually go take a look and like, kind of comment from there. Okay. Alright. Thank you everybody. Can we please thank our speakers for the wonderful discussion. Appreciate it. And that will conclude this Atf open meeting, so in one seventeen."
