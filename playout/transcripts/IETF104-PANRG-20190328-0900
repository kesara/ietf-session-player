    "text": "we\u0027ll go to the last talk it was really running out of time did you check possibilities of address entropy because if you start to use different addresses and maybe just the sender address then the flows will be routed differently within a single domain in almost all backbones that I\u0027m aware of and the inter domain case you need to apply tunnels to get to different is paths you should investigate or think that\u0027s okay thanks for this register thank you very much I said yeah I think you posted to the list right that\u0027s right yes okay comments appreciate it Simon come on up we\u0027re sorry we\u0027ve got about eight minutes for your 15 so yeah we appreciate coming quickly Thanks okay so hello my name is Simon and my talk I will talk about how game theory can help us to reason about the efficiency of partner network architectures and to eventually help us to make them more efficient so the terminology I use here is about source based power selection and what I mean by this is basically a path where networking architecture where a nice pea offers its customers so the end hosts a set of possible paths to destination and the end hosts can then choose for themselves which have to use for communication this is in contrast to network based path selection where basically one single path is offered by the network operator as a result of BGP so whenever we discussed these two paradigms and the relative efficiency and we will always encounter basically the following opinion so in general network operators like network based path selection because for them it means that they can engineer and coordinate and orchestrate traffic very well so since they have a lot of experience a lot of information about their network they can basically guarantee and overall efficient traffic outcome so it\u0027s to use this analogy it\u0027s like by the scale of a good conductor that the music of individual musicians will become a nice symphony it\u0027s by the scale of the network operator that individual flows can be fit into an overall efficient traffic allocation in contrast to that source based path selection is viewed as something like that so network operators fear that if an host choose their own path through the network basically anarchy and chaos will break out so without the appropriate information and without coordination and those will take by traffic allocation decisions they will engage in mutually destructive behavior and so the nice efficient traffic allocation will give rise to a much more inefficient traffic allocation and so "

    "text": "the question I\u0027m interested in is how justified is this fear or put more technically how inefficient is the traffic allocation that we can expect the result from selves and those decisions and as kind of constructive follow-up question whether it can reduce this inefficiency by providing the appropriate information in order to tackle these questions we need to have a way to quantify the inefficiency the results from selfish decisions and we need to capture be able to capture the effect that information has on this efficiency and we can do this by game theoretic concept called the price of Anarchy where we need a social cost function that captures the social cost of a traffic allocation and a way to characterize social optimist or traffic allocations which minimize the social cost and Nash equilibria so traffic allocations for no single agent will unilaterally deviate and change its traffic allocation so these are like stable states in a network and once we have these three components we can derive this price of energy for that and we need to have a model of source based off selection which is here presented for the inter-domain context so you have the autonomous systems or a SS in blue and links interests links alpha beta and gamma every and hos reas can accommodate n toes for example here is a one that completes a 1 and so on and and every end hostess it demands towards other end hosts in the in the network so for example and this is the specter key so Andros even as demand of 1 towards and host E 2 and under C 3 s demand frontwards and host E 4 then this vector large F here describes how the demand is split between all the possible paths between this origin destination pairs and so it describes how much traffic there is on every path from that we can compute this vector small F here which is the link flow pattern which describes how much stuff there is in every link and and so furthermore links have cost functions and they describe the queuing or latency behavior of the link and in general add an order to link or that are being further largely in cost and as a result we can also compute this path cost here which is just the cost of all the links in the path but then we can derive the social cost function 1 for n toast 1 for network operators the time doesn\u0027t allow me to go more into realities are justified but apart from that we are also interested in like this we can characterize the social optima but we are also interested in the past flow pattern that result from the selfish behavior of end hosts of the Nash equilibria but of course the information that an end host has is very relevant for its behavior so we need to have a notion of the information at an end host has and one classic way to formalize the information is latency only information and host knows all the posts all the "

    "text": "cost of the paths to a destination for example here the end host Yvonne has a demand of one towards and roasty - it has two available paths and posed it knows the cost of both of these paths and in this network it turns out the cost of both paths are equal and if we have a situation like that the Antos will actually have no reason to change its traffic allocation so this is what we mean by an equilibrium but this iquilibrium here is dependent on the assumption of latency own information so when we have a different information assumption and we will get a different equilibrium and for example this is a the assumption of perfect information when an host does not only know the cost of all the paths but also put the link cost function so how they link reacts to latency and which is linear and constant here and also the background traffic so the traffic not originating from itself which is one here on both the links and with this knowledge and end hoes can set up such a selfish cost function it can minimize the selfish cost function when at this optimal allocation is reached an end host will have no reason to change its traffic allocation because all the other traffic and games will mean a higher cost so this is also an equilibrium but it\u0027s a it\u0027s a different equilibrium you\u0027ve seen before because the construction is different so what we see here is that we can take in different information assumptions we can compute different iquilibrium from that and from this iquilibrium compute different prices anarchy and when it compared this price of Anarchy we get such a difference a delta which is which captures the fact that information has and with this framework we can it gained in a number of interesting results for example we consider the angles optimum and the network operator ohm can be quite different and we can bounce the price of energy above given certain assumptions on the latency functions we can prove that additional inflation can be beneficial to network performance but that it can actually harmful so it may be bad to provide more information okay okay and as the last thing we also see that additional information becomes irrelevant with the scale of the network so for example Internet it might not make such a big difference where we have the latency only information of perfect information that we are seeing so with this I\u0027m at the end of my talk I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t have time for questions but again we don\u0027t have time for questions but I\u0027m the chair so I get to ask a question so I\u0027m gonna do two so first of all this is really interesting to give a little bit more of a formalism for I forget the numbers of the questions but there\u0027s two questions that stalks about like with respect to interest and you know how you know oh no it was purchased ability or it like sir exactly this is one of the open questions in the in the draft that we\u0027re considering here who is this work that you would be interested in pursuing further in this research group that\u0027s "
