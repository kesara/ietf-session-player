    "text": "of this okay okay okay thank you for this presentation in this work I think this is an interesting topic so from some abstract point of view I agree that she could be viewed as a superset to some of the functionality that is already in 6lowpan header compression for example the stateless part of sixty to eighty two and I think it makes sense to analyze this example in 6lowpan header compression typically in the best case an IP UDP had ipv6 UDP compress header would have a size in the best case of six to seven bytes whereas with sheik it could be easily one or two bytes for example there\u0027s a trick which is in cheek there\u0027s this information that context which is assumed to be static like forever let\u0027s say and basically if you know in advance how your packets or packet headers will look like you can take advantage of that so I guess that the design for 6lowpan was a bit more generic because maybe the static cannot be sorry that the context cannot be a static like that but perhaps there\u0027s a subset of 6lowpan scenarios that may benefit from sheik header compression one question to the room do you see any interest in doing chic for mesh networks where we actually need context distribution or I will say it depends of the constraint of the Sheik networks you are the trade-off between the effort to care to send the rule everywhere and the benefits of doing do we have such do we have a study where such networks are documented where it makes sense to actually go apply Sheik in sixth oh I don\u0027t know maybe in in the white Sun maybe it could be interesting to see because they have both topology could be enhanced this draft with with that data where where it makes sense to bring in Sheik in sex law okay yeah custom oh man this probably has been said in one way or another but I would just like to keep in mind that both 600 and Shaykh have context they differ in how extensive this context is so in six law we can essentially only provide a few addresses that then can be used by the six to eight - compression mechanism to compress some some addresses a little bit while shake of course has this extensive mechanism in shake so far the assumption has been you provision this per pair in sixth law "
