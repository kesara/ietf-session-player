    "text": "going on right away I I you know comes from the school of thought that we do not charter working groups with these kind of broad amorphous charters and we don\u0027t really know what the what the goal is or what we\u0027re trying to solve for and we\u0027re not really there but we\u0027re also not really at the place I think where like I can cancel my lunch meeting and go write a real focus charter for what what the work is that we\u0027re going to do in the IETF so I\u0027m willing to kind of continue processing what happened today and and try to draft up a charter that we can maybe kick around for a while on the list and and see how people feel about but I don\u0027t have a real crisp sense of what we\u0027re asking the ietf community to commit to right now as far as as what we would do in a working group but maybe if we do that in parallel with with the other things I just articulated then that clarity will come so that\u0027s that\u0027s kind of my sense of of where we are right now it\u0027s a great if it doesn\u0027t seem right I mean you know I think there is I could see some value and performing precisely the exercise that John described I think of you here are some options we think are attractive right enough that we can articulate to lawyers do will we meet these tests with these options and I think the kinds of things that we see and the design team document I think are actually not that far from that so I could kind of imagine trying to scope something that maybe have that very tactical goal I don\u0027t think you need a working group to do that though yeah so as a next step we could say what we want to do is refine that down into something though at least allow those tests to be executed and that seems like something the community does right that\u0027s not something about the lawyers do like we need to figure out for ourselves what we think of the interesting things to ask them that could be tested all right thanks thank you anyone need to shine a blue sheet who did not they are here come sign one "
