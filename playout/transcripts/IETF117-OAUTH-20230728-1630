So since the the the specification is based on SD charts, I think it's makes sense to recap what SD charts are. SD charts are selective disclosable charts. adopted by the or fetching group already. and it enables us like this disclosure of individual claims that are included in GWTs. As the short, they this specification doesn't have any assumptions on what is in the actual payloads, what is included in the generalities, that can be anything. also doesn't have any sort of semantics. and it is not a verifiable credential format. Next like this. So this is what a how to produce an SD charts and what an SD chart looks like. So an issuer of an SD chart. they would have an input short claims set like this. like, sub. given name claim family name. It's a Chasten object, plain Chasten object. And then they would turn this into the issuer signed chart SD chart payloads, which is in the middle, I think Yes. There's one one specific claim that is interesting. which is the underscore SD underscore selected disclosure. which contains a list of claims that are selectively disclosable. how is this computed. So it's every entry in the SD claim is essentially a the hash of the disclosure object. The disclosure object is adjacent object, which contains a salt an ounce."

And it comes later in in in the specific slides on SD chart we see. So the actual SD chart is a compact serialized TWT with some extras. The extras are the basics, the 4 URL encoded disclosure objects, which are separated by tilde's like, a tilde character. So if you have essentially a basics default encoded short header, short payload, short signature, and then the social objects which follow the the the chart. Yeah. And then yeah. Next step. second. So what are very thorough credentials? So there are many definitions, we we have we're we're using at the moment. This definition verify, how credential is an issue assigned assertion with claims about the subject Paolo gave a really great presentation earlier on what's what are use cases of their fellow credentials and context of the European digital wallet. is exactly what this credential format can do.

So SD chart you see is So what it is what is contained in our specification was the scope. It defines a profile of SD charts. specifically for verifiable credentials. So I think most of you, Melania's room are familiar with Hope MedicONNECT, and GWTs. And so OpMedi Connect defines ID tokens, right, with additional claims. So so the same way that OpenMedi Connect defines ID ID tokens, which are a profile of TWTs, This specification that we wrote defines a profile of JWTs in the context of the recover credentials. So we define data formats in define a media type. I think we might like that. And based on and and the the the data format is based on SD charts and specifically, you you're talking about JSON based payloads. The specification also defines validation and processing rules for verifiers and folders of these SD chart PCs. on top of SD charts.

Right? So we also have this in our spec to explain again how a typical workflow looks like the referral credentials based on t shots, So one would have an you would have an issuer that can be any party. They create that very final credential. about the subject, give that credential to the holder of the credential could be any party again, and the the holder then presents that Pridem to verifiers without having to ask the the issue unnecessarily. the the whole can also create a key binding proof, which is also part of the SD chart. to basically say that it's basically it's an it's an anti clony tronic protection mechanism I can speak to that later. So then the verifier verifies the SDHR and optionally also retrieves certain status information from a status provider. And so this is this is basic information about the relocation status and it's I also wanna point out that mechanism that we have here is privacy preserving. So it you know, it's respects.

It uses a short based JSON based data model. relies on existing SD chart security. It is not based on the w's received verifiable credential data model. I I mentioned you have 12 contributors, and a lot a lot of them are actually from the the all of the team groups. So we have the the members actually of the Or if I can group already contributed to that spec, which is also why I'm here. And so, generally, I think it's the right people in this room to to drive this specification forward. because all Fortune group focuses on privacy and security. specifically, you know, in online and remote flows. like this.

This issuer heard privacy, I think, It could be worded slightly differently, but it's effectively how do you allow verifiers or token subjects like credential subjects, like end users that might say, I'm a shoot a a driver's license. It can be in certain situations, really, damaging to that user's privacy if the issuer of that credential can effectively track where they're using credential or or who they're using that with in terms of a verifier. So we refer to this as as herd privacy privacy privacy privacy privacy to the escrow watch. could be reworded slightly. So as to allow kind of verifiers and token subjects to remain within the herd. So if I had if I was in a herd of 1000000 Crisp. assured credentials, the issuer would only know that one and that herd is having their credential potentially verified when Status lists that are managed by them are accessed We want it to work with common formats.

So the status is indicated by the value of a specific in index. So we'll get into the representation soon. basically issue tokens are given are allocated in Index within a status list. and going to that index within the status list, and fetching the value tells you the status of that credential.

Obviously, it's represented natively in binary in the CWT version. the sales slashes need signed and delivered as a JWT. or CWT. Next slide. So this is an example of a JWT of a reference what we call a reference JWT. So the terminology in in our draft is we have the status list then we have a reference JWT, something that is the subject of a status. So a token that has a as a status that is being communicated by its issuer. effectively, we have a a status block here. and the status block has has a URI, which points back to the status list that you can fetch through, say, an HTTP get request to public resource.

Well, the token that verifying, And so the the status of this JWT looks looks like this where Obviously, it looks like a standard JWT in terms of the claims. that you have. and the one that is unique is a statuses claim. And so in here, you can see there is bits, and then list. So list is a gzip encoded, gzip compressed, base 64 encoded, representation of effectively of a better array. and bits refers to how many bits each credential referenced in the status list is allocated. So the reason we have multiple bits is so if you have a if you're issuing credentials where you need more than 2 statuses, So not just maybe active and inactive, or revoked or not revoked, but you might want a suspension flag.

So and as I said, obviously, this is signed so that the verifier Ken potentially cache this or fetch it from a re from a source that is not the issuer like, a 3rd party hosting provider. Next slide. So this is a little bit more details on how we unpick this. So you see we we have the URI. We're obviously fetching the entire JWT. We're then going to the list. We're doing a g a deflate.

I think the other thing to bear in mind is the semantics and difference between between status and verification and what you're really after. because when we say something like status, what we're really talking about is that that could potentially be general, and that may or may not have verification instructions alongside it, and a common real world scenario where that's been popping up for us has been in using credentials that were some kind of signed packet that represents a digital twin of a real world item. And so when we look at regulatory items there or digital twins physical IoT devices, for instance. Sometimes you actually have to represent the status and distribute that, and that code may be predetermined in some kind of regular tory body, etcetera. So there is this notion of an informational status that may be externally defined and being able to give a pointer to say, hey. Go look at this you know, registry here or this lookup table or the sometimes a PDF, frankly, in the case of, like, government cases that say what these status codes mean. And I would caution on locking out the ability for someone wants to represent those statuses from not being able to pass through say, a status value coming off the wire, coming off a chip, or coming from a regulatory body. So making sure that we can distinguish between This is an informational status or status with external business rules. versus this is verification instructions. I wanna fail you or I want to because those 2 things do get confused, and they should not be treated as the same thing. So cool. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Brent, Okay. Yeah. maybe you've got Yeah.

If the BitNet description in what you have here that you then take in Gzip and turn it into a JWT or CWT, If one side undo all of that.

So In general, I'm putting public in an asterisk here, obviously, because their terminology is is oAuth is has evolved, has become less reflective of the environment that clients typically operating in today. But in general, what we have is clients from another 2 perspective are are now operating in in minimum where there are. Achestations, platform related acestations that are available that can be used to help facilitate them perform client authentication, where they otherwise might not have good solutions today."

So when we talk about the kind of traditional public client and all of 2, they typically don't have any form of of direct client authentication. options unless they do, like, a a back end for front end style Pitten. So the question is, you know, given things like Apple Test on iOS and play integrity and and and various essay stations becoming available and more commonplace. How do we appropriately use these sorts of capabilities to allow clients to sort of authenticate with author with an authorization server. Next slide, please. So this is started jumping straight into a proposed solution is probably the best way to sort of communicate what we've work been working on. We're proposed to extend the established framework of RFC 75 only one. for a new form of client authentication. So for those that are unfamiliar with that draft, it's like a a the JWT assertion framework, which is what gives rise to private key JWT t, client authentication method, or I think goes by another name in Olis as well. loosely in this model, if you if you think about this in a concrete example of public clients, typically, if you think about web apps or native applications, there's many instances of the same client. as 11 possible mental model framing. Right? Like, every at installation on a mobile device as an instance of that client. They all often share the same client ID. And in this model, there would be effectively a back end service known to that client. where the client instance can generate an attestation key. basically an asymmetric keep here. and then perform a protocol with its back end to that might involve sharing those platform at your stations like Apple Test, if you're on iOS or any other platform legislations available to you."

Right? and how you put it in a request like a token request, like an old 2 interaction, a token request or or part end point in the likes. And So because the protocol steps are tuned for out of scope that backing an instance, communication is free to be is as elaborate as possible or as elaborate as that implementation chooses. Next slide. The the kind of key callouts here is The client authentication method that's used in search is actually a proof of possession enabled in the sense that the back end basically signs a creates an assertion, signs over the client instance public key. And then the client instance does a proof of possession and includes the attestation of came from back end when it interacts with the authorization server. We've got some examples that show how this looks. concretely, in in the form of JWT. a little bit lighter. Another point to highlight is that when you look at use cases like or applications like depop, which are send a constraint access tokens. For those that are familiar with that draft, Deepak, doesn't handle how you authenticate the DeepOp key."

The authorization server has to kind of trust that because that keys there in combination with an authorization grant, like an authorization code that that somehow kind of authenticate its client, but it's pretty informal. This draft can be layered on top to authenticate that Deepak key. So an authorization server when string and access token, and say, I know I'm issuing this access token to a client instance that is if I if I trust the process that's happened that I'm not aware of, which is between 2 and 4 of how that attestation was generated then then then the access token I'm binding to I know is for a key for that. for that gen genuine client instance. It's a direct mode of authentication between the client since the authorization server rather than a a back end for front end style pattern where the instance would talk through the back end the authorization server. and it avoids the need for the client instance. having to register with the authorization server for DCR. via DCR, sorry, like, dynamic client registration because The instance could be one instance sharing a common client ID, and it is effectively just being able to or authenticate to the authorization server. Next slide. So this is just a probably an expansion for, like, a native app, but It's largely the same diagram, but just to be clear, If you have a mobile application running on a mobile, I'll OS. It's a it's an instance. and that's In that use case, it can talk to potentially their TPM what you see. that's available on that device.

Next slide. So this is an example token request. Next slide. So you can see here the things that are for those that are familiar with the RFC 7521 client assertion type we've defined a new UR in here. which is a JWT client attestation. And so that's that's what's new. next And you can see, basically, what we have here is 2 JWT's concatenated by a tool. tilde character. For those that are familiar with SDJWT, it's effectively the same sort of syntax. You've got the client attestation, and then you've got the client proof of position. s 2 concatenated JedipiTace. Next slide. So this is that kind of expanded caveat people try and validate the signatures on this. I did mess with the JWTs in preparing these samples so the signatures are not valid.

So effectively, the client at your station says that this key as this ATS station requires confirmation with this key in order to be used as a form of client authentication.

George Fletcher, the having done some of this in the past, we often looked at requirements of of nots in the beginning of the flow with the authorization server it can prove that the attestation is something that's related to the interaction with it and not just some random value that's showing up from the client even though I trust you know, even though the the key chain is there -- Yep. -- or the that Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I didn't know if that was some of the thinking or if there was an expustive reason, you weren't sort of looking at that. Yeah.

So you do have some replay attack kind of detection there or But Yeah. I mean, it gets into the whole aspect of mean, I as an authorization server, I could easily say, You, you know, you're doing something like par Right? and you're starting an authorization request, and I need I want the client attestation. That's part of it, right, earlier. Right? Today, this is one of the problems we have in there's no real way to do client authentication at the at the beginning. Right? It's only sort of when you get a a token level, and it would be nice to be able to do it before you start your authentication pieces. because an attestation of the client with 1st party not for party all sorts of other things at the authorization server level. gives you knobs you can turn in the sense of reducing friction for users. So in that context, Right? I would like to basically have my authorization server nonce. in attestation issued by the client back end Right? so that I can show that these things are all connected Yeah. So you could just to come back to it, you can use this with Pat, though. So if you're talking about you know, preauthorization request You can use it in that part of it. Right.

So what kinda get gets into the main point here, which is which is that I think that that any kind of attestation like this is it's it's a hint. It's a signal, and it's it's some input that you can use to make a decision, but it's not an absolute And there's actually a lot of points in the various parts of the LOA flow, that kind of signal is useful.

And then you have the par end point, you and you also have the resource server, which may also care about it aside from any other tokens that are included.

The person speaking just reflecting on 2 comments. So first of all, George,"

    "text": "yes, we are looking for a way to to really get a AS provided nonce into the flow. And as Tobias thought pointed out, the code, for example, could be work working as that. I just wanna point out I don't think it's a good idea to include that nonsense into the attestation itself. Because at this station typically is something that is long term and can be stored on the device. for for for for subsequent use for multiple users So we would put that in the proof of concession. Just just just making clear because that has a different consequence. Right? second, Aaron, the the the reason why we started that work around client often is pretty simple. especially in the items and other other spheres, it's important to to to really make sure you're talking to the right application. and then do some authorization on top of it. For example, in the IDAS, you need to you need to make sure that you're talking to your Interoute empty wallet that is certified. So that's the reason why we started that work there, there, there, as an extension as a client authentication mechanism. But, obviously, the attestation format can be used to laces as well. that's that's it's vacuum. Thanks, Thorsten. Peter and Justin quickly, please. We are over time here. So I'm Peter Castleman, very supportive of this work. I think good comments about maybe generalizing it in other ways, but application that I see for this very specifically in the work right identity space, the authentication piece is really interesting. So to me, this fits a a problem space that that I see Thank you. Thanks, Justin. Justin Richard, plus 1, 2, all of the comments on generalizing this. There have been a lot of conversations this week alone about where attestations fit. Not only client to AS, but also client to RS, as Aaron mentioned, but also AS to client because can solve some discovery problems that we see in the wild as well. So a general purpose mechanism for carrying typically bound or tied into client authentication or even Jose. I think would be a very good thing to be able to have. that said, to the to the previous point of where you put in the non that"

    "text": "I think it was Torsten Seth. It's been a long queue. I've lost track of who said what. the the bundle of the proof of possession should app absolutely be separate from the attestation themselves. and because the attestation can answer a lot of questions outside of just the proofing of keys associated with it and the context in that. So I think I think there's this is a great stab at it in a specific case, I think we really need to pull this concept back. and because this is gonna touch a lot of different places and solve a lot of that people are having today. Thanks, Justin. And thanks. to buy us. Yeah. I do have a couple more slides the finish, or are we over -- We are way past -- We're way past the time. So so It's from my perspective, I feel there's lots of support for this. So we're gonna try to call for adoption over the mailing lists. k? k? Thank you. Yeah."
