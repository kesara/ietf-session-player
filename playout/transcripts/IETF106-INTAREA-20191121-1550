Ethernet frame and second we are not following the procedures from a draft in essence based on segment routing we are going to do when we are going to be capsulated either on a frame we are going to do some processing on different kind of flu cups based on segment routing so we are not following a dealer and is our IP processing at Cisco Systems so also one of the reason is this is an l2 VPN case and today for l2 VPN encapsulation for a frame and then I\u0027m Phyllis label packets frame goes directly cannot here Oh common our Cisco Systems load for you so in MPLS case as well we have al to VPN we encapsulate incoming frame into labels start directly there\u0027s no shame layer for ether I over IP I think we want you to keep the similar for a service-based l2 VPN where we have an ipv6 header and SH address table set and I\u0027ll to frame directly we don\u0027t don\u0027t want to have any other shim layer in between which is a Ethernet IP I think you are suggesting plus plus we we have to be fully compliant if we were to do that a different Ethernet IP spec the ether IP drafts at 3378 defines the next header value for say everything after this is Ethernet that\u0027s not my understanding yes but we need to have to either net our IP header which we do not have and then it defines how we do that the us processing which is not the same oh there\u0027s no ethernet header note the Ethernet header they learn another YP header the four bytes of either or net or IP IP v6 header then Ethernet IP header and then undone frame so this is assume they are we talking like vs. in MPLS you have label stack yeah I think we need a picture there yeah thank you that\u0027s been verified sorry my hope okay and one more comment as published at the deployments which are actually in progress is we are asking for actually also an early allocation of a code point that will have the deployment switch are about to deploy a dissolution right now thank you thanks "
