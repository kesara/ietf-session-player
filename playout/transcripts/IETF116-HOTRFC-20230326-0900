Liz did all the work in London, but missed all the fun on Sunday night so this is the first time I've had an opportunity to introduce liz in person to you. And I'm just watching why are coming here. So So this session is under note well so please pay attention to that. It's a little bit weird because the people who are getting up talking know that it's under no well, and we don't actually have questions or discussion in the Rf sessions. So But like I said, you know, if you start to do something that would be covered by the note well please know well. If you have not seen this next slide, please. If you have not seen this before, we have a thing on meeting tips and just please asking people to sign in using the mid echo lite client from the data tracker agenda.

Each person gets four minutes from when I say go, to Please applaud in four minutes, we started applaud, and that looks like this on the next slide. Yes. Cool. So the good news is that all the speakers will be applauded. And that will happen whether they finish early and get put in or if they run right to four minutes and get point there and then they stop talking. And then the next person, you know, next person will be ready to speak. We have Six and a half of our eight people who had registered for this to speak here in person. At the airport coming me through coming through customers, so he's not here, but he's close. Closer in Canada. And So it'll be pretty easy for us to hand over microphones. We have one.

But if you're not following presenters in their bars to start a conversation each person's material should help you find way to contact them and a way to participate and contribute in helpful ways with them. All of the slides that they're gonna be presenting are in the data tracker. And We'll be using that for all slides and we are pretty much to letting the letting the conversations begin. And let's stop on the next slide. And You remember when I told you about making sure the why. Yeah. Well no. You're gonna be doing everything else. I'm not completely incapable. Right. So first up, We have donald east lake. Talking about hiding Ip b six by options. And just to make sure that everybody knows plea you can tell us next slide, you know, the the presenters can tell us next slide next slide next slide and it will do... And we'll do the right thing."

Obviously we just wait the time on the screen Anyway, what's the scenario, You have packets that are going through some area in the network. And unfortunately sometimes these days, packets with top by hop options get discarded or otherwise mistreated, And so you want to avoid that problem, by doing something at the edges of that region. Next slide. So there's some assumptions here that you have cooperating destination or destinations. You have the best ever services is okay. You don't actually have to execute the options in the area where they're hidden because when they're hidden you can't... The network won't see them Next slide. So what's this is the Ip six header should be familiar to some people at least. It's kinda simplified Ip four, but you notice there's no options in the header. Instead there's this next header field. And options are encoded by using a special next header value and putting them after particular, the next header value zero. Next slide? So this is what I option. Extension looks like it's called a header extension in Ip six and you can put the the what the actual next following thing is, which might be the payload at Tcp or something in the next header field there. So it's the is zero and the initial Ip six header that indicates options. Next slide. So this is the simple elegant solution. You said my opinion. You simply replace the zero in the initial ip six Header field with a two much determined new opaque. Ip protocol number. And then the problematic part of the network will"

I assume the cooperating destination. You can switch back to zero. So notice that this was a trivial change for the backup. You're changing the value of exactly one bite in a very simple deter way It's easily reversible. Doesn't change the size of the packet or anything like that. Next slide. So I believe that change is a very simple elegant wave overcoming this problem. I interested still in getting comments on this draft somebody watched to implement it, that would be great. And dispatch means that most so just comments on the draft, but also comments on how people think that this draft this idea could be progressed I'll. Donald finished about a minute early under four minutes. Be light donald. And Thank you for saying that. Because... Yeah. Okay. So So this is Thomas talking to us about.

And if you've been anywhere near a call center in your life, you know, I'm not lying. Next? For all the stuff that we have to deal with, terms of customer privacy, those things which are the most private or the hardest to change For instance. If you look at this, picture of myself, You'll see on the left hand side things that were true for me in nineteen sixty nine, that are no longer true for me in twenty twenty three. However, except for the pixels look exactly the same. Next. So one of the things I've come to learn is that responsible organizations want to behave for responsibly Reputation damage to the ways in which they interact with their customers is very important to them. Yet There is no standard by which they can do their jobs as well. Especially as it relates to the storage analysis and deletion of our most personal data the recordings that contain our biometrics. Again, changing your name is way easier in changing your face. So the econ standard is a proposal turn to express a conversation Some people call it a Pdf for conversations that contains four parts. The dialogues of the obvious part is the part that has you know, wav files or, you know, files or whomever you're going to to to record, they are the facts and the physics of the situation. And the parties identify who was in the dialogue. And I don't mean the old Cdr way of parties I mean the Internet"

I I don't know if there's any other place in this in the in the globe that you can go and look at what pieces of Ai have used your personal data. And they haven't companies who have a responsibility to track which automation used your data. If you ask for your data to be deleted, those enterprises, those ethical enterprises will delete the data that they used from you. Including the things which we care about the biometric bases and voices. And the attachments every conversation happens in context. The context of a carly lead, I work for a car store, or not. I work for a dealership or it's around a pdf or this pdf for this conversation. Conversations have context and the v standard allows you to deliver that across the network. Next. So here's the big use cases first, privacy and customer data protection. I've I talked about that a bit And here's a bunch of questions that I just can't answer without a standard for how you a conversation? Is there... Is there personal information it? I don't know. I can't tell you. Who's in there? No one's assert any identity. There... The the econ standard is the platform by which you can build tools to answer these questions.

The Asus is a self hosted approach for sharing opera interoperability and imposed see information of a communications network. And next slide, please? I will contrast the asus to so existing systems so that you kind of have a feel what it is about? So we have some systems in the internet today, such as luis or are e up and also pairing db b And those systems provide information about systems or Ip address or do domain names? And those systems work well, but there are some disadvantages. Some of them including that affected that they are intended for public access or have a lack of access control. There's also the fact that they are centralized systems And they often our rate limited. So if you want to request some information about a bunch of be ranges for instance, you may run into those rate limiting. Issues. The aces on the other hand is supposed to be the opposite of this, so Well, maybe there's still some rate limiting, but it's not as limited, and it's not centralized. Next slide, please? The idea besides it being self hosted is also that we can use the aces to share more information about networks. By we, I mean, of course, like network operators. Some information that's parties may be interested in could be stuff like technical contact information or security contact information that's already available now, but we are thinking about some other interesting like maybe data, Bg routing community sharing them in a more standardized way and also some other types of information like which data loss applied to a certain network for instance.

We are taking you and we've been trying to it out the way to system that a little bit. Part of the problems that I've heard in in one previous on? In terms of how to define technically, some of the things that are required. In engineers specifically when it comes to the prediction. Next slide? So some of the problems that we identified was a misunderstanding the nature of data, so there's currently eleven definitions for last count so we cannot get our heads around about what data is. It's gonna be very difficult to try to figure our ways to protect it. There's also difficulties on the cycle of software as well as this very strange burden put the in the shoulders of citizens because of the current regulations, but also, the lack of motivation of technologies because we don't really define for them purpose. And by the way, I forgot to mention before, that presentation of this up particular concept. We believe that it probably sits in the application layer but it may have some applications or some considerations on on an Ip and transfer as well. So that's the reason why we are presenting it here. Next like. So we figured out a way trying to explain things such rice and so forth, but also ticket it right, we figure out a way to try to put it in a much more algorithm or technical way to explain it next? We also figured out a way to maybe come up with a definition about what is an actual human right versus what would be a digital right, What would be the the proper way to define them. In the basis of how to define physical house also digital holmes, next? And so we can help with this concept of data centric digital to the right framework.
