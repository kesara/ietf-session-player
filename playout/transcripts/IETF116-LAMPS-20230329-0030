And please treat each other with respect. And keep the discussions about the ideas, not about the people. Have a very long gender. Fortunately some of these topics are just nothing changed since last time. We just wanna make sure we keep them on everybody's radar but there's four slides of agenda. Those were sent out numerous times in the last month running up to this meeting. Are there any agenda batches? Okay. Then we'll quickly... Basically, it's broken down into categories of things that have already moved off to completion. Those are just so that everybody knows those two Rf finished. Then things that are with the Is or the Rc editor, There are a couple things to talk about in that group of documents where comments have been received the need to be addressed. And then there's a whole bunch of Pk related documents? And then there's a whole bunch of s related documents. And then there's some documents that we are thinking about adopting."

First I'll start with sixty seven, twelve this so this draft is more or less complete. We moved it to github to to ease commenting and discussion. But there is nothing to do and no major changes since Hundred fifteen. The forty two ten bus is also complete with regard to the changes performed by C p updates. But there is There are changes in the loop with regard to adding cam support, for Kemp support.

People can see this in the draft zero six We also moved the document to get up So people can also are afraid to race issues there and see the work progressing. Yeah. So this is one slide on the The pros cons for Hp versus using plane. Cameron k. S s. We we see this as a more straightforward approach because we do not need confidentiality. We do not need sealant open from Hp we mainly establish shared symmetric key shared secret key to be used then with Mac based protection.

But while while discussing this and and yeah, having a first draft in the document we've feel like we have more flexibility if we just describe how to establish shared secret key for one side if one side has a ka key and then leave it open whether the other side also uses a cam key or usage it signature key. So that we we have more as a metric approach just specifying how to established as a metric key form or a share key for one client or the server side. Of course, it can be used if both sides have a cam key but it is not needed then. So looking at the to approaches. So this would mainly be as a approach if we establish joint share to secret key where We we take the the two shared secrets, Ss s one and Ss two coming from can I point here?

Thanks thanks for us. I really appreciate any reviews and comments of course Right now, we have the approach with this establishing of one shared secret key.

And they don't have any wrappers. And so what they did for the for the key part, which is the public key. They put no wrapper. So I was like, oh, that we can do that. And then we looked at the private key definition and it also had a and Jake was like, what's that for? And I was like, well, that's because what we did in the past. And he's like, do we have to keep doing that? And I was, like, I don't think so. Now this might seem weird because these keys are huge. To save a couple of bytes here and there. But if we don't need to expose the syntax let's not just leave it all up to the Hs m and then whatever and you know, it's all... It's not like the the electric curve private key to spend like a page explaining that the first byte is at zero or two or three and it means this and it exposes that tells you what the other side is.

And then there's really not a lot of questions. The only real the only thing that's really gonna be left is the public outside, the private key format, which is not really an interoperability thing. Right? You usually store it locally. So we'll have to have an argument our discussion, I guess about how much and which parts unique apparently you don't need to send all of it and the same thing with the Lithium certificates it's like how much of it descent. And the thing is is for larger devices like your laptops, it's not really a big deal. But for Iot, it's kind of is a thing. So we have to kinda figure out the the right kind of balance there. Deb. Oh, I've not looked at this. Have that looked at cover. What If classically for encryption such sorts of things. We generate stuff in the back end and Jam to the clients. And that point, the private key format matters because it's I have to generate it and give it to you, and you have to be able to like handle. Right.

Is it just slide cleanly into your wrapper or are you specifying a contradictory format We're we're for the public key, we're providing no structure. Just a straight up bit string. There's nothing. And so we're basically proposing that for the key. Because the the weird thing is the way the construction is, those fields tell you how to bang it into another structure. And the product key format out of Or whatever. Right? So that that's already not testing over there. We're just saying put that value straight in the oc head strength. Don't put another wrapper in front of it. Just dump it directly in there. So it saves a little a little bit. So for example, what he's saying is with an Rsa key, it's a sequence of the modules in the x exponent. And so you have to D encoded to get the oc that string.

But there was a suggestion to sort of balance it out and make it similar to how in the extension we have hash of the whole cert just putting that up in the Csr as well. And I think, you know, that's a good suggestion if there's strong opinions on that, you know, I think that makes sense as well. The last thing is that... So currently, we have the hash for the in the extension, the certificate that's hash we use the same one that's used to sign the cert. We did that from a it was a suggestion our comment from Nest. It kinda makes sense since the cert and the extension are being created at the same time, just to use the same hash. But there was a suggestion to maybe out of field for algorithm tires that you could use a different one if you wanted. Just to make that more flexible. I think we had that in an earlier draft and then changed it. So also an easy change. So if there's a strong opinion on that, I don't think that's a big issue a change either. Alright. Next slide.

So right now, the the whole document is written from the perspective of looking at you know, getting a P q certificate and then adding in the related certificate of the traditional one.

So just a little recap of the things that have changed recently. The header confidentiality policy minimal, sorry. Let me just give you a brief overview of what's happening here. I think the end of this presentation, you'll you'll find me asking for working group last call on this draft. If you have not been paying attention to this draft for the last years. You probably should start paying attention. So updates for the most recent changes. We This I think happened at the end of the last Atf, but the default header confidentiality policy is H minimal. That's the recommended default. Which means that, basically, you will be... When you encrypt a message, you will be encrypting the subject. And you will leave the other headers visible on the outside of the message. That's for deliver purposes and just to make sure that the things that the user probably most thinks of as content are most likely to be protected. We say that mail user agents have implement this must be able to generate and interpret the injected headers strategy. If you recall, there are two schemes, there's an injected header scheme and there's a rap message scheme. Rough message scheme is more similar to the thing was standardized standardizing in S m three point one, but have very few implementations. So you may generate route messages and you must be able to interpret them. Note that wrap the rap messages scheme So the the injected header scheme, have to be able to do if you wanna find implement this draft. And you may include this legacy display element in the body. So that legacy decryption capable, mail user agents can still see the subject line that had been hidden by H minimum."

That aligns it better with the injected headers mechanism which used instead protected protective headers equals v one as a parameter to the content type. And finally, We added this Hp removed in Hp obscured headers that enable the recipient to tell what the sender thought they were protecting in terms of confidentiality. When they receive a encrypted message where the headers have are included inside the envelope. That makes it easier for receiving values agents to deal with these things without eventually leaking headers in reply that we're not leaked on the inbound. Side. Next slide. So a little more detail about two different schemes. A reminder here The injected header scheme basically says, The goal of the executive scheme is, we want these messages to be as close to standard messages for the recipients as possible. We wanna provide as weird artifacts for the recipients while still enabling geographic header protection. So for signed only messages, it is one hundred percent compatible with legacy mail user agents. And within an encrypted message, that does not attempt to to hide any of the headers, but just still wants to preserve the signatures is over those headers is also one hundred percent legacy compatible. If you have an encrypted message, which does hide, some user facing header, like the subject. Then a legacy email user agent is unlikely to be able to render the actual subject of the message. And so when you are generating such a thing, we have this draft defines these legacy display elements that you inject into the body part up the message that"

You can generate this injected header scheme without any risk. Next slide. The wrapped message scheme is a little bit risky to generate. And I think that's one of the reasons that it was never widely adopted. When you generate these things, legacy clients extended to kind of joke on them or they present them as a as a forwarded message or they present you with an attachment that you have to click on to open and then you have to deal with the attachment. So it's a little bit more clumsy. Have some attempt to work around this to make it possible for legacy clients deal with them more smoothly. Like, the signaling protect header equals wrapped. And content in mind recommendations. But we do recommend it that you generate the injected then Injected headers variant instead a direct message. Next slide. So the as I mentioned, the header confidentiality policy, we define a language in the draft that says here's how to decide which header to hide if you are encrypting a message, you don't necessarily need or want to hide the all headers. And if you do, you may run into deliver problems. The language for header confidentiality policy designed to encourage mail user agents to developers to talk to each other and say, hey, I'm using this new confidentiality policy and I'm not having deliver mobility problems. You might wanna try it. The draft defines two H p's. One of them is H no. Can imagine what that does. Doesn't anything. And P minimal is the recommended default that only has the subject header.

You're working on a agent. Next slide. We have title the draft It was head of protection for S mime. Nothing in the draft is s mind specific. It will work for Pg mine as well. So the new draft title is head protection for crypto gravity protected email.

There will still be future evolution because the emails system and doesn't... The ecosystem doesn't stay still. Some ideas about what will happen in the future, we'd like to see If enough of adoption happens, you can not add these legacy display elements anymore because you can expect your recipients to be able to render the injected headers properly. That would be nice. It makes a lot simpler to generate a message if you don't to think about the the injecting these legacy display elements. We what folks to start thinking about?

You had the lock with the slash through it. That was a warning signal. People heard about the warning, So you know it got back to the website developers. They change their websites. People don't do that so much anymore. So... And maybe the behavior will be slightly different. Right We have this secured context in the web maybe you'll your... Your mail user agent will behave differently if the headers were not protected. So we think that there's opportunities to evolve to make things not only simpler, but but safer.

And then you said that you know, vendors might do other things or we we expect them to document that, but is there gonna be, like, a reddish steer or some standard way that so can do that. We are not currently contemplating a registry. Our hope is that people can publish a if you're if you if you're a male written implement and you say H no is unacceptable to me H minimal, doesn't do exactly what I wanted to do and I wanna do something fancier. We hope that you'll just publish a draft. Describing. The hd... The header policy that you're using. If there's a massive proliferation of head confidentiality policies maybe somebody should set up a registry for them. But I don't know that we need to to jump to that right now. We don't have people knocking down the door to be like, I wanna claim the name, h, Seven. Yeah. Sec. Yeah. But yeah. There... If if you have... So, I mean, the hope is"

Or should be remove it entirely on the outside of the crypto envelope? That's all the H is. And it just says try to write it in this way. Because it's easy to communicate across mail user agents. We don't expect to end users to have to make decisions, but the developers should. So the goal is just to create a common language that developers can communicate. And we hope that that will happen in the form of Internet drafts. Okay. Hopefully, that works. Yep. Alexander again, regarding the last point, I also wanted to ask about the registry, but he was ahead of me. I envision that it's possible to different developers will find their own names for configurations which actually do the same thing. And just like in this case of the Q key draft, which talk talks about one way to serial keys and then there are other approaches these things can begin to proliferate and then it would be more difficult to control them. So I think it would be reasonable to think of a registry in advance. Because I mean, if people want a registry, we can have this document ask registry and the registry will be named and then reference and the reference will point to you on Internet draft, and then we have some designated expert decide what they are. I'm fine with doing that. I don't think that's your block working group last call. If that's the feedback from the working group I'm to ask for a registry for My here. So I had a comment in chat about this particular issue. My personal opinion is the first Rf draft that wants to add a new H would be a great place add in Ian considerations for That works for me?

So one of the concerns about the end to end male guidance draft is that the previous draft we just talked about the head production draft, actually refers to it and refers to some... Some some concepts that are in that draft. Particular, the crypto catholic envelope and crypto payload that are described in that draft are critical to getting the header protection stuff to work correctly. So we risk that draft causing a mis... We risk this e email guidance draft becoming a which could block the header protection draft from publication. I don't think that should happen. I also don't think that this particular draft is necessarily something that we're gonna be, like, done. We've solved the whole problem. Now we know exactly how to do end end mail security.

So The recent changes if you haven't read the draft recently, we added some guidance about dealing with Bcc and encrypted email, which is an interesting weird little corner case. You send an encrypted email and you wanna Bcc, do you encrypt the Bcc? Do you... What are the what are the different ways, like, If you encrypt the the same message to the Bcc folks you might be leaking that there's an encryption and to the target. So there's some nuance in there. We try to add to document that those concerns. There's an additional section that talks about. A very tempting implementation architecture. Which is say well, my mail agent already talks I'm app and S T p or Maybe a talks map. And, you know, doing all the crypto is kind of a pain to put it in my mail user agent. So what if we just stuff it in a little proxy, it sits between my mail user agent and the actual I'm at pop Sm service. And that the proxy just invisible handle all of it, but That be good. Right? And there's a section here the talks about how tempting that is and about what the problems are of that strategy. What what some of the concerns are with that strategy that have to do with how you how the some of the trade offs you should read this section if you're interested in the trade offs. Since o five was released, There's a little bit of extended. So we've expanded that warning about this proxy implementation. To say, hey, it's not just about the mail protocol Apis, but protocol the mail protocols as a proxy, but any Api that is similar that just says you know, here's a message do this thing. Turns out, you actually need some knowledge about the state of the mail user agent. To do end to end crypto gadget protections successfully. So extends those warnings about the proxy implementation to any comparable Api. And there's some references added to the J map work. Because Jim App is thinking about this stuff too."

Basically your trying to prevent the recipient info headers from the closing to the recipients with the Bcc recipients are because there will be recipient info for them. If you don't do a separate submit for the for the blind recipients. That's right. And so the the guidance is, you know, you need gonna need to make multiple copies of this message and submit it to the your mail submission agent, whatever protocol you use. Know, a different one for the folks who received it in Bcc then the folks who receive it not in Dc see. And there's some even trickier things when you have multiple people bcc seed. Because there is a question of do you want each Bcc recipient and they know... Know that the other Vc recipient is has been Dc seed. So there's a little discussion about that and some guidance for what we think is probably a reasonable approach. If you're agent implement and you thought about these things and you think we've got it wrong love to get more feedback from other agent. Employers. So Bernie and Alex alex I'm I'm currently the only listed editor on this draft, but Bernie alexa giving me good feedback on it. So I I wanna call out their help particularly, I'd love to get more feedback from other implement. And then there's this issue about it being a misread for the head of protection. The missed f is when a document is... Is missing a reference and can't be published as an Rf because it depends on norma guidance from some other draft that itself needs to be an Rf. Next slide.

It is possible to lose your secret key and still be able to decrypt your messages. For example, when you receive a message, you could store a copy in it symmetric encrypted archives.

That's what we use to to do this in the cam recipient info. So Go to the next slide, please. So... Yeah.

It's it's the key that's used to actually encrypt your message. So that's pretty straightforward. And then what we do in Canvas, each recipient. Needs to create their own key encryption key so they need to make basically encrypt that and content encryption key. So the way they do that and the way we do this course as we use the encapsulate method. So to obtain a to obtain a pair shared secret and cipher text for the recipient. So once you have that Yeah. So the recipient does that. And then once you have the the cipher protection share secret, the the you use the K function with the shared secret to and also some other user information potentially if if that's user keying information that can be sent. And so you use that to derive your key encryption key and then, of course the key encryption key is then used to encrypt the content encryption key.

As well to generate the encryption key and then using that key encryption key, of course, then they can decrypt the content encryption key. And then finally, when you have the content encryption key, then you can decrypt the content on the message. That's essentially how it works and then the important structures on the next slide.

Then you have the K algorithm. Which, you know, could be could be any of the... I guess, the came back on was the last example on the last one, but it could be anything that's specified and they also have the key encryption key length. Which is a size of the the key encryption key that you need. And then the user key material is the next one is is is important. We had a couple iterations of this without this. It is used in a couple of other recipient info. But we actually... In our C p four forty two ten bi we actually talked about using this as well. So it's basically extra information that can be added along with the Kd algorithm to derive the key. So it just gives you that bit of randomness. And then you have the the wrapping"

The big change was that we've listed explicit pairs. So the working group in Philadelphia asked rather than just have generic and some like here's how you define explicit. We should actually lay out the explicit. So we've done that now. We expanded the list quite substantially since one sixteen.

I'll get to why there's three generic in a second. There are also some Hash sign variance. So if you really care about taking your message, hash it once and then firing that hash down to the composites. So it's the same hash across. We've got a variant that does that. Max talk about that. Ke, we've got ten explicit and two generic again, I'll get the why two generic. We did do a lot of work on the One modules. They are lengthy, but they now compile, and we hope that they're good.

So this is sometimes since sometimes in some environments, especially when you are yeah that have being, you know, in a mixed the device device base environment and most over your time. You might add the situation where you can evaluate k signatures, and that might be good enough for you. So for example, devices might not be fully upgraded and so you have some several limitation. You might add... You might switch in your in your migration plan, you might switch to different algorithms in midway, So you think about this as a cyclic migration. Right? So Many many people are only focused on B but in our mind, this is a a very occasion to really build crypto processes. So this is where we are focusing on. And then there might be some implementation issues, you know, mean some some some devices or others for need newer algorithms. So this is the all the The reason why this might be good a good sense. Now I do the decision period if the k out of really grants you the long term confidence that you need. That's perfectly fine. So so in the draft very simply, is the same structure at the composite.

Still not getting the utility of this Algorithm goes notification.

So suppose we today, create a fifteen year certificate with lithium Rsa or something in Thursday. And then in twelve years we decide... No. I rsa is not secure but you can break it on their phone. Okay. So in what sense are we invoking the algorithm and I mean, are we telling the clients don't check the rsa on this existing certificate mode checked only did they lithium him. I mean yeah. We can do that. But that's that's something that the client should know and should not receive that from the C, but further from the software vendor and I just don't see the utility of the C evo an algorithm that it just assigned. Because the signature is still valid. It may not mean as much as it did right today, but it's still valid. There's nothing to revoke. Right Now you the idea here is that, you know, if you may...

Indeed it does, I was gonna work with the authors to figure out what the sequences is. Okay. I wanna leave them separate. Okay. Strongly not merging them. Yeah. So here's going from huawei international So I don't object to adoption. So my only question is that a technical one. So sounds like half ago, I read several of your documents. About company the case ago as say an idea very good. I don't give a complete review. But I remember one question is that when you do k etcetera like it's a key Id may have two ideas. Long is a basic one, like, okay, I use to basic algorithm. For the key of signaling etcetera. Another one is a flexible one. So So so the... So the ag Id maybe just tell the program. Okay. This the composite king which basically algorithm or specified. You needed to pass the data and lies and I know what is basically. Maybe two case, maybe three keys, and no what's the key Ag name. So I would like to know which approach you are using now. You. Right. So the current document specifies both, we're calling the first kind explicit and the second kind generic? Yes. Flexible is a good name too. We're"

    "text": "currently, we're proposing to standardize both, although there's been some discussion here well, maybe we should remove the flexible one. Yeah. That means to the messy. Yeah. Okay. Basically both of them. Currently, we're trying to specify both proposing to specified both. Okay. We should talk in the coffee break. I think we should. Okay. Okay. We have five minutes left. I'm hoping we can do fifty nine ninety bi. Hello. I'm Sean Turner. There's, I think one slide. So to be able to do this quick. Can we read them? No. I sent me slides. Can you request? No. I didn't load Okay. Sorry. Alright. So the next slide is why do we need this? Well, we got this new k recipient info, and so this kind of back ports, I guess I'm not sure if that's the right word, the original cam. Honestly say, can. And now I'm not a photographer. I don't know if it's a great Tim or whatever, but we're just kinda hasn't crossing the keys here. I do know that there was an outstanding question. The one comment got from My put you on the spot. I did give you a heads up. So Are you okay? With the suggestion that russ made? Yeah. I've been looking that email and I haven't given you an answer on list because I I might have been to drunk and writing Ids at midnight when I put that question out there I think I think what you have in O is good. You you're carrying the Rsa chem parameters not the generic hybrid parameters, and I actually think that is what I need. I don't think I need to carry an Aes. So I actually might retract that midnight comment, but I need to look at it"

    "text": "more. Fair enough. Yeah. So the... So the really interesting part is is a little bit we actually have a forthcoming one version, and Russ is able to send this to cook, and he was able to verify it in the bouncy of castle. So we're actually having and the appendix that includes, you know, base sixty four coding and Asm as and one coding, so people can verify it. And so the grand plan is can we adopt it? Call for adoption underway, the only outstanding comment is mike. So as soon as he answers it we'll know the answer. Okay. And again, since rest is a c author with me, Tim gonna be the one making all the decisions. So Correct? That's it. I guess I say I'm also doing a pop draft. I'm working with my coworkers authors. I sent it to them. I don't know twenty seven hours ago, and they we're having some discussions about getting for, so that should be popping on as well. Thanks. Okay. We have, like, two minutes left. This presentation pretty short. I There is. You hear me? Hey, daniel. Yeah. I'll keep it short next slide please. Yeah. So the purpose of this drop is to register the purpose of entity certificates to prevent misuse. The basic reason that we wrote this strap is work for the five use case basically add new extended keep as that interface for ko purposes. Jose the you're saying? Looks like. Given that we've got one minute, Could you tell us why you need soy? Okay. Next slide, I think that should explain why we needed that. So this was part of discussions that were happening in three, I mean metro functions in three use, service based architecture, they use steel for communication and they use for signing and basically encrypting messages that's exchange with network functions. And what we have to is is we with with virtualization and"

    "text": "services act architecture. There is potential chance of misuse. So we wanted to restrict the purpose of these certificates figures that they don't get used beyond the purpose they being assigned by the internal series. So for that purpose, the next slide, please. So We have defined four key identifier. And I believe one of my colleagues had presented this next slide. Yeah. There some discussion on whether we need two details with key usage so four and we thought it's it's for processing rooms, it's much easier because It makes life easier to process just whether it's for J aws or J or J b rather then combining that in putting in one K u. Next slide Yeah. This was presented in the technical reporting in items, and here there was consensus in taking this work forward provided high is interested in that. So I wanted to hear whether we believe there... It's if it's not contentious, then we can... If you could make progress on this drug. I I think the top two bullets here capture the only controversial part here is do you take use to usage bits to determine whether it's signature encryption or do you do the combination into the a the email protection is an example where the top approach is taken. And I'd kinda like to continue to use that. That's personal opinion do others have any thoughts? Silence. Okay. I'm fine with border okay. So why don't... If you could update the document, to use that first approach, then we'll do a call for his option. Thanks. That will be great. Thank you. Thank you all. Sorry we didn't get through a whole agenda."

Yeah. Exactly. So I just I just wanna down enough that I can sort like Like, from my point of view, things fall from sky from five two ten. We do stuff with it. I don't really understand okay. No that sounds great. Thank."
