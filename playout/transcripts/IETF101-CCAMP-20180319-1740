    "text": "so one of the things that Rick talked about is is that these radios are often IP aware and the way they they cheat they they while they\u0027re really forwarding on a MAC address they also go look at the at the dscp and it is true that there are certain radios out there\u0027s actually even forward on IP addresses I\u0027m not that you guys know me more from the sea camp world I know more about the sea camp world I don\u0027t know about these radios then built what never worked on well I never touched one so you know some of the people in the room may say yeah IP radios are really it and your perspective on Ethernet is a little biased but but there\u0027s both markets out there so we have pause that\u0027s the really simple one and then we have something which is a credit based approach and the the value here is you can keep the line full if you have a credit based approach the router can know what it\u0027s different credit windows are and only send traffic when there\u0027s credits available in the pause mechanism it has you have to get a message that says stop so what happens when you say stop well you\u0027re not necessarily keeping everything full with credit windows you can be more efficient about your your utilization and also the routers can have a better idea of making sure that the the right priority stuff is being forwarded on to the radio so the big thing with with pause is let\u0027s be simple the credit is let\u0027s be as efficient as possible both of them operate on a Mac destination plus a dscp basis we had a bunch of discussion at the last meeting about that we would like to optimum maximize the reuse of data elements the data items what\u0027s the data item we would call them TL DS so we want to maximize reuse of data items between different extensions and we had actually had a lot of parallelism in the two extensions but not exactly reuse and we talked about trying to optimize it we took an action to do it and we looked at it and said are you sure because it feels like we have extra processing in this simple simple scenario of pause that yeah it looks nice for the control plane perspective and it\u0027s nice you get you know you save the code point when we have what to the 16 code points available and why not make it just easier for everyone implement the counterpoint is well if I have all these objects it\u0027s easier to implement if I only have two if I implement a common set so there\u0027s a trade-off there and that the fundamental question I wanted to ask the working group is which way do we go so keep that in mind that\u0027s that\u0027s what that\u0027s gonna be the punchline so oh I "

    "text": "basically talked to this slide and said you know it\u0027s nice to reuse ideas and one of the ideas was actually Rick\u0027s is that we should introduce something called a sub data item sub TLV hey we know what that sub T of ease our goodness that\u0027s a good thing to do but the identical reuse of data items between these extensions seeing not to be from our read worth the extra overhead in the simple case independent of that question maybe I\u0027ll jump to that question and then come back we have a question of how many documents because we\u0027ve ended up doing some a bunch of core extension like one core extension to the protocols the sub data item another one is the concept the product windows and the last one is how do we identify them and yeah actually I\u0027m going to talk about this little sorry going the next one is how we identify them and the question is is do how many documents do we need and do we keep this all bundled into one document do we break out into multiple the other thing is that we said in the past and the working group we\u0027ve talked about is identifying baseline Ethernet priority code point is an interesting use case versus dscp s and that would be a reason why you want to have these reusable objects so you could do that so to convince ourselves that we actually had a viable building block approach we did a definition for Ethernet PCP and the question is whether we want to do something more than keep that as an appendix this a notional thing making it real was actually really little work it doesn\u0027t take a whole lot do we want to do that so we came up with a recommendation we think the sub-items the house set of items work that\u0027s a good independent piece of work that should be published it\u0027s basically the definition of sub TLV formats and in the protocol that\u0027s a core extension it should stand on its own the next is is basically how credit windowing works and independent of traffic types and that would be a mechanism that itself wouldn\u0027t be an extension but the extension would be when you use that together with a certain traffic classification and so we think it\u0027s important that that should be a standalone document and then have a traffic classification definitely 4d scps that\u0027s what we\u0027ve been working on and if there\u0027s interest also could do the the ethernet one so there\u0027s probably not time to go too much into this but I\u0027d love some feedback maybe I molester very quickly no Rick Tyler very loudly I did a bit of analysis on where we might want to use sub data items and following on from the conversations we\u0027ve been having I the only place I can see where they really make sense is is in the traffic classification data item this "

    "text": "sub data yeah I currently use them in pass we use them both but pauses using traffic classification data items really that\u0027s that\u0027s my point it\u0027s pretty so you don\u0027t you don\u0027t want it to be a generic thing I would have a generic traffic classification data item that supports sub tail V\u0027s okay I I would vote for making the concept of a sub TLV a generic look I\u0027d be like wide because I can see things coming you know there are some possibilities where we could use them okay yeah I don\u0027t have a strong opinion about that it\u0027s it\u0027s I just from my analysis I could only see them really being manifested currently in traffic less and Detroiters but that\u0027s fine if you are if you want to make another document agree with you in the current incarnations that\u0027s the only hard use case we\u0027ve got for but what I was gonna say during my presentation which will skip over is I want to use that traffic classification data item for a third use case which is when I have flows which Traverse different paths across the radio network let me show two slides but I\u0027ll show you walk away what do you think about Ethernet should we be working on the the ethernet document or if we just let that I would have that within the traffic classification document to say here is the specification with a sub TLV for diffserv and here is the sub tale v for Ethernet because they each need their own extension because you have to know whether you\u0027re doing it based on dscp or Ethernet given that they\u0027re easy and they\u0027re pretty thin documents yeah I mean as long as we don\u0027t annoy the RFC editors by producing a hundred and one documents or three pages each they don\u0027t have any RFC\u0027s they okay so that\u0027s a joke we these looking to the chairs do you think it makes sense to do this the split that we have here should I should we proceed with this split I think so yes I I don\u0027t have a strong opinion either way okay I think more towards the point of having too many documents if there\u0027s going to be a use for having them split up then I think we do it that way if we\u0027re going to just split them up because there may be a use sometime in the future then I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea that would go to the document one documents the the diffserv and Ethernet really makes sense to be in their own because they\u0027re two different extensions and you wouldn\u0027t doesn\u0027t you don\u0027t want to have to point to to one RFC as they implement this option document document one is the one document out of the group but I\u0027ve got a fairly strong feeling about I think it ought to be separate alright so we\u0027re gonna go the next wave will break this into four and we\u0027ll work with the chairs and how we name them so sorry killer just jump in I could go "

    "text": "back one slide I think I would like a document 5 which is traffic classification data item so that was the top level that we were not gonna do but that\u0027s okay so we can break out crap I suppose you could include it into three or four and refer to each other so here\u0027s the traffic classification data item it\u0027s the one in blue right in the middle the only difference between what we\u0027re doing today and making it generic as we would cups sorry we would call the we would have a flow control identifier iron instead you just want to make that a generic flow identifier and that\u0027s actually where we had talked about that the last meeting so we certainly can do that I think we should talk a little bit or whether we really want five documents versus maybe put it into maybe put it into this credit window document called something else because it\u0027s just a component that\u0027s reusable maybe the maybe the sub items credit window and the traffic classification go in one document which is just new data item document cuz there\u0027s not any extensions on their own yeah that works for me I I tried a first pass at the flow ID draft and 75% of it\u0027s absolutely trivial and the last 25% I don\u0027t have the answers to all the questions it\u0027s it\u0027s the corner cases are really hard and I would like some help working on it but I think this is a good proposal to start look through the details on this what I call this this card adoption because one of the key things is we really wanted to do the work upfront on the session part and because we were doing the work upfront on session and only a very little bit when an endpoint showed up it meant that we reorganized the data a little bit yeah and if you get it just if you distributed it on one hand works that more it works more naturally for the objects but it does the wrong thing it puts the heavy burden of all the computation checks when the destinations up so it makes it longer before you can send data now I\u0027m totally sold on that approach yes the details of what\u0027s on this slide with the difference of calling it flow identifier and instead of flow control identifier and if you\u0027re okay with that will be in sync if you\u0027re not please bring it up on the list okay so we\u0027ll go for a three document split and get some confirmation that from Rick that it serves his future purpose and well we\u0027re hoping we\u0027ll go to last call on this "
