Of these 23, there are 4 that or in what we call a post working group last call stage, and one document for which we just initiated working with last call. So essentially, there are 18 documents at varying levels of maturity that need to progress to working a blast call. Of the 4 that are in post working loop last call, there was a revision published for the ACTN Vian Yang document earlier this week. That should address the comments received from the sheppard. So expect to see that get progressed to the next stage pretty soon. There was a revision published for the applicability of ACT and to network slicing document as well. That came in maybe yesterday or maybe the day before. That should address all the comments that were received during working group last call, and we have initiated an early routing direct review for that document as well.

The authors have, confirmed that they have, responded to or clarified all the questions that were raised during the review process. They are acknowledging that there are some minor edits to be made, under also requesting working a class call. We would like to ask the authors to go ahead and make these minor updates before we take the document to last call, also like to request the working group to review this document in anticipation of an upcoming class call.

There was a strong requirement from the operators to allow this mix of type of WVM Networks. We clarify that that when you configure the lager, you may need to configure, for example, the numb the minimum number the links, and we identify the gap in the existing armored which do not provide this capability. And that we added a description of how, optical service of the billion network can be set up using a mousseponder. Identify the gap to report to some of the most constraints, and we, that gap has been already addressed by the by the second working group after. So it is a gap we didn't in this work, which has been, already fixed. We generated description because the vehicle network can provide both ranges and transparent services when you carry traffic from the routers.

So we are dealing with a network where we have different domains, packet domain, working together with an optical domain. The key issue here, if you have read the POI, you, you know, that the connection between, Let's see. The 2 networks or the 2 operators domain or whatever. Opens at the IP layer.

So let me just proposed the question that will be also referenced later in the next slide. If, EU think those cases are relevant if anything is missing, to the discussion. Because, clearly, there is a lot of material to be discussed. So what are the cases? Starting from number 1 and number 2, the top right. So we have, the cases were optical linger as a fault. So there is a a break of communication, the, the fiber breaks, something like that. So we have the exchange of the service flow between R1 and R2, as to take another path. Clearly, we have to consider 2 cases here. We have protection and restoration at the optical level. So we have to deal with the difference of both of them. Then there is another case, which is number 2, which is basically the same So the service has to be interrupted, but not because of a failure, but because there is a maintenance activity so the operator clearly does it on purpose. In any case, some actions have to be triggered to preserve the service. So clearly, there is fast rerouting operations or something happening at the IP layer, but we have also to coordinate, let's say, the mechanisms at the optical layer. And the discussion about it.

So we decide to keep it for the moment. But we are not sure whether it is worth or not. Because it's a bit complex and probably the applicability in the field is not so it's a widespread. So a question. We are posing whether it is interest. We continue our discussion and we analyze that case over Then we have case number 4, the failure of an entire router. It's not likely we understand, but a case proposed, again, by Telecom Italia. So it to keep it and, to discuss what happens In case a router has a failure. I was mentioning before, 4+1. The 5th case actually, is how to deal with the reversion of the configuration when everything is solved. So let's say we have, case number 1 an issue on the optical fiber. So we decide to switch service on another path, and it's another optical path that happens after the coordination of the IP and the layer.

So first one is a high capacity point to point connection. Overall educate the the fiber. So there is a, let's say, nothing nothing in between, so the the fiber is is just for you, even you don't require any amplification. The second one is over a a service fiber. So you multiplex several connections over the same fiber, but it's a point to point. There is no no cross connection, so it's also issue 1, scenario, the scenario that we call scenario c. This is the this will be the more common, we believe, the more common scenario in in carrier's network where you have your Meteor renal a meshed network with the ROADMs. And, there, we're going to have this moment.

There are no no errors, but we assume that there is some knowledge before And finally, we go for the service, for the provisioning itself where we have the the pluggable to pluggable service provisioning.

The network slicing is another solution set, which is different terminology. So if you go and try to use the anti q We're exercising. You can do that, but you are SandroebEx. For example, we use, we can define the connectivity cost, connectivity intent using a slice solution. Network model, model, and we specify the SLOS LE for the connectivity instant. Then we have a apology reference, from the was lies, to a single note apology, which is the entire one where we please specify again the connectivity the intent. So we have a duplicated information about what is micro activity intent. And then we have to manage what happens if there is in consistency between these two expression of the same intent.

So the FAQIs are defined in, in a, in a way that, they include a number of parameters, like, could be the packet delay budget, the packet error rate, tougher characteristics and some others, priorities and so on so far. So, because this is, stated in the, 3BB level. Once we intend to carry the the traffic in the net transport network, we need to So how map those values? We try to some mapping of those values. Into the SCP values in such a way that we can ensure a disputed quality of service as as expressed with the 5 QIs. Somehow realizing the network. Next, please. So the scope of the contribution is, essentially working on, this idea of the FAQIs. There was an initial attempt for doing a mapping of the QCS to DSCP in the draft that you can see their draft and peers me, w u g, they've started to QCI, draft. I I will comment a little bit more on this later on. And what we are focusing is, departing from the idea of,"

So the The draft entry, what, intended to the approach of, in this case, was, associating, okay, in a kind of individual conversation between the fake QIs or QCS and those point on time. And the SCP values, essentially taking us as a as the hook, let's say, for that mapping, the type of of service. In the specs from CEP, there is this, definition of the TCIs of IQIs and a kind of service example. So that was the case on how for trying to do the association. That transformation in the is not always straightforward and somehow could be subjective mean, not not objective at all. But, well, this was the the methodology you followed in in that case. Is a, different approach the the one that I will explain later on, which, and the one that they we're exercising the draft. Is essentially to group the fake QIs, according to the characteristics of the 5 QIs. So, it's all altering to do an objective mapping to the DCP in terms of the expected characteristics of the flows. And we will see in the next slide. Next, please. So this is an an example of of a grouping So the you can see on the on the frame in the more or less on on your right, there is a kind of a legend on how the FICOIs are are expressed. So this, like, you guys are expressed in terms of delay and and and packet loss. And we would be what we did was to take the specification from 3 EPP and trying to map this in, into accessing one access for the packet, error one of the access for the packet delay."

An tv, right? So all of them has this kind of property, so the delay and the packet loss, and we essentially put in in the map. In this particular example where we were to define for groupings, one grouping that will be the the one that you can see on, on on the left and the most on the left. That essentially groups the fake QIs in terms of the the expected delay. So very, very minimal delay. Is more or less coincident with the delay a critical GVR. Then a second grouping, that's somehow takes, the values that are around mid delay, let's say, So always behind below 100 milliseconds. With different, properties in terms of packet loss. And then the remaining groupings were essentially, the white ones that will be the DVR was as exemplary grouping 3. And the non GBR. For the rest of the, of the categories. I said this is just an example just for illustration purposes. Next, please. So with that grouping, then there will be the possibility to are mapping to the different queues. Again, this is just a kind of an example And you can see that, for instance, the group 1 that was the the critical in terms of a delay can be assigned to the, to the, 2nd less prioritize queue in this case, so on so far, and grouping 2, grouping 3, and grouping 4, being grouping 4, the one more, let's say close to the SFO and, being allocated to the last, queue in this case.

The filter, construct, was originally part of the NRP model, but we decided it was, generic enough to be, treated in a separate standard module. It's, as the name suggests, it's used for filtering network topologies.

What we see as a typical, implementation of the bypass protection is that, we do not reserve the bandwidth for the or even try to think about the bandwidth when we, signal the, bypass is, therefore, it goes through the shortest path between PLR and MP which is, of course, not sharing the fight with the with the protected. Resource, However, that means that the bypass could be rooted through the totally over, totally utilized resource like link or event link, which has not sufficient capacity. There 4, if when the bypass is activated, We Could observe Losses. Uh-uh congestion losses along the the the path taken by bypass. So that's one. That's typically is happening.

Of course, we could potentially reserve boundary and signal the bandwidth, for a bypass, but then we reserve capacity, which will be barely use and, use very for a very short period of time.

So no reservation, but the path is computed along the path where I have a little bandwidth. It's sufficient to handle the protected volume, protected bandwidth. And of course, this bypass needs to be, optimized and recalculated on the events but not too frequently to not overload the network for we move to the next slide? Of course, the first first step is we have to find, we need to understand how much we are protecting how much the volume the, bypass is protecting And this could be done locally on the PLR by just looking on the LSPs which are protected and what is the they are bound with reservation.

And, of course, all their procedures are possible, but that's that's part of the draft. Could you move to the next one? I wouldn't spend too much time on this one. It's more for the documents, The main point is that because there is no re the bypass capacity is not reserved, so it's not visible in the training engineering database. So we are not overbooking or we are not booking the, say, the bandwidth for the bypasses, which are for unrelated, failures or just use it by minutes. Could we move to the next one? The last part was optimized bandwidth infrequently. Of course, we have to calculate, year old for bypass and the signal, the bypass when some event happens, right, like, periodic optimization. That's one. When we have the bypass to no failure, signaled by PAF error or PAFTS, whatever happens along the a bypass path when the bypass is initially initialized first time for a LSP constant needs, protection.

And because we from distinct PLRs, their for and because we are not reserving and we are not effectively, we are not modifying the traffic engineering database therefore, we could lead, it could lead to the situation where We create like, dual booking or overbooking of these of this available capacity.

They could end up all picking the same set of links, and that could translate to overloading the in case of a failure, overloading that, bypasspath.

Did you consider reserving the protected bandwidth, in a different bandwidth pool, different from the, the actual reservable bandwidth that, resources, in your network have you know, have your protected bandwidth sitting in a different Bandwidth Pool. That is my question. So, yeah, of course, but the the That would be require ice according to my knowledge, some ex, because these bamboo poo cannot come out from the if if it comes from the just interface pool, bandwidth pool, then it's it's taken out from the interface capacity Right?
