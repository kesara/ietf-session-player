Also we have curing policy model as well as scheduling policy model So essentially what policy learning all these policy modules do is take the base template from that traffic policy module as as action from the Section module and combined that different match criteria with the actions and come up with their own policy module. And so that how it become a different policy based on those matching actions It will become a occurring policy based on occurring religion and and matches similarly for the scheduling policy. Okay.

So if you look into the queuing policy definition, we have fatigue in this example, we have three classes voice, video and data, and we have added few actions to it. So if we looking into the various action for the cooling policy we have p definition And if the priority value is less that actually indicate the priority of the class is much higher is higher. So for example, a priority level of one is at actually higher priority than p t level two In addition to priority, we have been fine minimum guaranteed bandwidth, which is defined by rate And similarly we had defined maximum shipping then defined by the max rate So if we I have not included these actions for the video video and daytime. But essentially, these are similar kind of actions. So if you look into this particular particular example, we have minimum guaranteed golf twenty percent.

So rest of the three percent of the bandwidth we will be divided video and data assuming that the for video and see which is delivery two is video has higher priority than data that it will have higher over the beta. Otherwise, if they have the same priority then bandwidth will be remaining bandwidth will be shared equally between the two. Mixing. So as a next steps I think you rightly taken can get of All the young doctor comments commence. We probably will be adding maybe one would example for for example, the scheduling policy. Scheduling project will essentially take occurring policy leaf level and create Hierarchy of q policies And this scheduling policy then applied to an interface.

Net reduce network lock and next sequence. So from experiment so results, we can see that by leveraging the in network computing capability it can dramatically improve the overall performance if you ask the switch or routers in network but to perform some some some data operation. So for instance in the net reduce, apparently, asking switch to do aggregation of the data improves make the system around the one point five one point five times faster.

Aligned. I mean, along with your statements. So we actually try to define something which will happen in the network while how have... I mean, how it will happen? I give two examples, As or mp or could be other G or others? Maybe cats can bring more solution there. While wildfires mainly focus on defining what happens and that action happens in the network on one point zero. Two points. Lovely. Good. I'm lot more comfortable. I have some some technical issues as well about how the transit nodes know that there's a header underneath the encapsulation. Well basically, the"

    "text": "the transition node... You mean the node just forwarding the packets. To to nets next month yeah. Well, basically, they are not aware about it because you capture the as can payload, while, they for instance in in case of mp. You just pop up oh just pass by. Right? Switch to the the labels, pass back. But the the the sync capable one will actually find this... There's a header he can understand that and Okay. So the sync capable nodes are deep enough... par them to find the sim error. Yes. Thank you. You you are done. Right? I'm not next in queue. So practically, you're describing collective preparation it's not really the atp to be operation. It's the that's trying to do some functions and distribute information back to everyone who has data to send in process Right? At least this is how netflix looks like. Right. Right. So The operation is state and are not really building routes your building three. And you shouldn't do anything to the tree before each not the participate and collective operation get the data back. Which brings lot questions about how do you signal when operations starts and resiliency So collective operation can take really long time for think something like large language models. Right. So none of this considerations are the drop date. This solution doesn't make the problem statement doesn't major solution. If you're thinking about collective preparations, try to take a look at sharp, for example."

    "text": "Right. So so the complexity is really in many things of the trees providing to consistency across all participants in the in african So I would just expect much more on your document rather than just calculations. And again, we are looking at collective three operation, not really a to b, so it kind of creates wrong perception everything. Good points, coupons. I want to come in the back basically, Yes. You're right. When we wrote the candidate Dr maybe have not re tackle rules because original or aspects. We assume that's that's this in our computing will happen to close environments. In a controlling environment, not in open internet yet because in that case, you you probably cannot really anticipate when the pact arrive and how long will be waits whatever we're starting from a limited domain, basically, points the in the data center where the environment are more or less is on the control. So you'll not know that's the packet will arrive more or less thing in time. But I agree that's even, you know, controlling environment something might went wrong. So in that case, more more things to be considered. This is one thing. Especially for the the batch computing mode where you need multiple source. Right? But if you only do that fall from one source. Maybe it's less complex. So if your only points generally won't lock from to answer the request from one source, this might be simpler. Yeah. But I agree in general. That's more to be considered."

    "text": "Yeah. Yeah. Okay. David. Go ahead. Yes. Goes living bit in the same direction as the previous comments. I think you need to focus on the correct the characteristics of the computation rather than the computation itself. So whether you have some some element network that can do calculation that is on the single packet versus needs and amount of packet. And saw you draft that you list actual operations And I think it's actually better to remove that and cut the scope off. Just describe what what different cases you have targeted here. And even maybe you think about how the network can signal that it is capable only of this operation that only looks at one packet maybe. And that's also goes to the other comments. Yeah. Yep. I you're right. So basically, the switcher router with sync capability capability should actually announce is its own capability whether you can do this operation or not, whether it can process that in line rate or not and how much it can do. So that's had Yeah. Need to be puts to probably separating somewhere else. Yep. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Please continue the discussion on the list. And with that, we are adjourned. Thank you everyone for all attention and for a wholesale see you on Friday. everyone, Thanks enjoyed here and see on Friday."
