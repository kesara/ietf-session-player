    "text": "reducing flow completion time by 63% and when we use the three queue model having already separated mice and elephant it had less of an impact because that that alone is a useful feature but we still saw on average of 25 percent gain in flow completion time now the lost the lossy scenario or the one that tends to be deployed a little bit more where we\u0027re not using priority based flow control what we looked at here was well how do we reduce packet in general and we looked at two different scenarios here one was where I don\u0027t tell my upstream neighbor about the congestion I just do local rescheduling for that flow that had about a twenty six percent gain over just pure ecn tech mechanism but if we do signal to our upstream neighbor we\u0027re effectively adding more buffering you know to these to allow these flows to be delayed while the EC in control loop catches up and we saw a larger savings in in packet loss so because of that reduction in packet loss you get better throughput you get lower latency a number of obviously beneficial factors we looked at how long if you you know are using PFC how much are we reducing the use of it so because we know it kind of has bad implications but it\u0027s still your last-gasp effort in order to not drop a packet but what we\u0027ve done is reduced the the frequency of seeing those packets significantly so the impact is much much smaller and the amount of time that they\u0027re paused is also been reduced as well yeah and my government\u0027s again how fast is this exile necks off the transition now how often can you do that can you the millions of times per second or hopefully do that yeah I mean you can you can do that if you\u0027re a frequent I means propagation time between the two two nodes and it\u0027s based on thresholds that you typically set on on the cues that will not have it the hardware would support nice sending back to back for one microsecond x effects on well yeah I would I mean they frequently of receiving them I don\u0027t think is an issue for the hard moment of really the duration if I\u0027m setting an X off and I wait one microsecond and I turn x on again the the receiver will pause for one microsecond and then resuming wait you\u0027re gonna it you\u0027re gonna have a packets worth the data that you\u0027re pausing as well right you\u0027re not stopping you know crane understand propagation and so and it\u0027ll take a while for him to react right but if I\u0027m just flipping this will he stop for one microsecond and then resume again he would stop for no so quantum in there that he stops for there\u0027s a minute I don\u0027t remember a thought my hair with the numbers Pat can probably correct us on this but there\u0027s a quantum and then it would stop for a packet duration so when he receives it he might already be transmitting a packet so so if you sent it too close together "

    "text": "he might get the X on the X off while he\u0027s sending a packet and then get the X on before he stopped so he it might have no effect at all generally the wait there\u0027s a time quantum in there and that\u0027s partly to protect in case the X on gets lost so most of the implementations I know of set the time quantum to maximum and count on that they will send it on when when they an X on when they want it to go back on so generally they have a buffer fill level where if the buffer gets up to this threshold to the high-water mark they send the X off and then when it gets down to low when it gets down to a low watermark they send the X on so that hopefully they don\u0027t they the bump here does an empty before things start coming Michael it helps the answer the place you might be trying to ask is this this sucker X on X often PFC are implemented very low-level hardware very close to the correct so my point here is that a hundred gig one microsecond is ten packets ten to 1,500 bytes packets approximately if I tell it for one of my crochet one microsecond the pulse if I got the you know raised to the ten here correct 100 Gig I\u0027m asking him to pulse for the equivalent to look great of tenth you know 1500 bytes packets is this actually feasible or am i off magnet yeah as David mention he\u0027s all implemented in the Mac chip itself it\u0027s all hardware there\u0027s because I mean if that guy has shared 12 mega byte buffer for the entire thing ten packets here is actually you know it\u0027s a non-trivial part right and you have to calculate that Headroom you have to if you try to be purely losses you have to it is on microsecond scaling-up milliseconds absolutely except I don\u0027t know anybody that uses it on that yeah short of scale I mean that\u0027s not the way it\u0027s generally deployed okay what like this Pat mints and the way it\u0027s deployed typically is you you send an X off for a maximum amount of time and then when you hit a threshold of fruit of availability in your Headroom you send in a queue you cancel it effectively yeah I know Pisgah first of all what\u0027s the trust model I are you assuming and this is puppet sort of multi-tenant cloud or is it what is it yeah it\u0027s assumed to be all under a single administrative domain data center you know somebody\u0027s managing a data center it could be a it could be a cloud or there\u0027s overlay networking running but a single operator managing the infrastructure okay so one landlord there is a god there\u0027s a god but there\u0027s a lot of you know sort of Satan\u0027s helpers in the potential in cloud in "

    "text": "virtual machines or whatever yeah so have you considered virtual queues instead of PFC or either to complement give you a bit more time for the make sure we\u0027re trying to eliminate or not use PFC at all right yeah so and there yeah so we we have talked about it severely the ability to do say hierarchical queues or things like this that are sort of out we wouldn\u0027t necessarily standardize me kind of implementation specific so that that has been kind of has been discussed by virtue of queues I mean what we called here pre congestion notification in years ago which is where you can notify congestion before the queue is before the link is actually it\u0027s buffering ya know and we head out that gives you more Headroom so it so you can you can start slowing down the other end before it\u0027s you\u0027ve actually got to the so we can talk about yeah yeah this is about this dish is a different design yeah no but I mean that was mean you\u0027ve got you wouldn\u0027t have to use PFC because you\u0027ve got enough time to stop the source ending right yeah yeah but a virtual queue slows you down before you start into buffer yeah if if these are if these are I don\u0027t know Broadcom switches Cisco switches they have virtual cue in their hardware hmm already okay next so we actually do have this and it\u0027s not 1500 byte packets it\u0027s usually like two thousand five packets I\u0027m so many from Oracle so we actually used like two thousand byte packets or four thousand red packets so and yes the buffering is a pain and yes we don\u0027t like the FC but we also are trying ICN and we have PFC the edge not at the core and ecn mostly works except like for the initial burst so the real key to this is that you know if the enter and Sen works you won\u0027t need this this is only in addition to the ECM correct that it\u0027s in support of EC n right and so the idea is that we\u0027re providing let me go back to this picture we\u0027re trying to provide enough time for that blue that control loop to do its thing so the assertion is that as we get to faster and larger more data centers that can be potentially more data in flight the buffer sizes are not keeping up with that performance so we want we want to make Sen be more responsive in those kind of environments and so what we\u0027re doing is using effectively the switch buffering for the controls that needed that are causing congestion to give time for EC into to kick in so that\u0027s that\u0027s the fundamental a high-level objective there and that that\u0027s also some rewired Barban advocate "
