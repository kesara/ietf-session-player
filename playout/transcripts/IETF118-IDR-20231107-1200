So we know that, there are many, many use cases that service providers or operators in general are not only operators, not only providers, our networks as well needs to be divided into smaller pieces, the smaller domains. Could be different reasons for that. So one is some, you know, some regionalization inside of North north part of the network, salts, east, west, whatever. And they're in different different domains. Second could be some admin native separation so different operating teams are operating their network. For example, I could have, you know, one team operating access aggregation network and our team operating their core network, and and they're in different domains for from from that administrative perspective, then there could be you know, size scaling of the networks. The network becomes too big, so we need to divide in the other pieces and so on. There could be probably some more use cases for that. So I think that's clear that we need to see there are some use cases that we need to divide the net from then the second, is how we interconnect networks. So of course, external BGP, EPGP was designed to interconnect such domains, but there are many use cases that it is not very, you know, easy for the operator to introduce this one. For example, the brownfield deployments, the network is growing. We need to divide the network with the smaller and then, of course, there could be problem of the renumbering of the ISS if if you start to use new assets, acquiring new AS numbers and so on and so on, So that's the reason we see in deployments as well today that many operators are using IBGP to interconnect the domains. And this draft is so we're not trying to argue against EPGP versus IBGP to internet to interconnect the the domains, you know, to least advantages, disadvantages, We are trying to acknowledge the IVGP could be used, and we are trying to"

On a data plane, there is no, the actual data forwarding paths might not be consistent with the BGP pass which might raise security issues. over the past few decades, So both the, academia and the industry have worked significant, proposals to improve the security of inter domain routing. This work can be roughly placed into 3 categories. The first category is the BGP Security Hasment among which are the 2 popular RFCs RPKI and bgpsec, which is being standardized by the by the IETF.

So today, I hope to present a a FCBGP that is trying to improve, the security of inter domain routing So, specifically, we have these 2 design goals, you know, in my we design FCBGP. So on the control plane, in the case of full deployment where all the are upgraded to support FCBGP We hope that it can guarantee that any BTP path authenticated by our protocol is a is a real and legitimate pass. And announced by all the AMPAS In other words, it is invisible for the adversary to claim a force to be bgp pass be candidates. To be authenticated in the case of partial deployments where only part of the AS is are aware of this new protocol We hope that this FCPGP is completely compatible with native UGP That means the Fc PHP speaker the native BG speaker, they can communicate without any change of of the native B2B protocol also, we hope the FCPGP is incrementally deployable And such that it offers strictly positive security benefits for PHP pass whose own pass ASs are not fully deployed So we hope that with this compatibility, and incremental deployability, we can we can incentivize the early adoption of this protocol.

So they can sort of sort of like either discarded traffic or enforce any low priority on this traffic. So before diving to the protocol, we have we discussed first some of the problem space and assumptions. First, the way assume that's the AS is have an access to an internet skill, trust the pace. Such as the RPKI, which stores the authoritative information about the mapping between the AS numbers and IP prefixes. And because FCPGP will involve some cryptography operations, we also assume that, they have stored the public keys for those ASS. And second, we consider that the multipass forwarding either because of the traffic engineering or ACMP is not a violation of the data data play security. That means if the inconsistency between the control plane and data plane it's because of this multi path forwarding think that is fine. That is not a security issue. And then we also can see there are very strong a diverse rate can interpret all the Bgb update message in network. So they could crack this BGP update do analysis and behave arbitrarily like, a launch pass manipulation on a on a data on a controlled way to hijack a BGB path. Or they could basically spoof the source addresses or reroute the traffic to some desired AS is on data plane. And finally, we, finally, we excluded the case where to compromise the AS is will will include. So, basically, this is because if there's 2 instances where we're able to close. They could share their private keys and they could essentially behave as the same entity. So it will be very difficult to derive any, desirable, meaningful security"

So let's suppose receives an receives an BGP update from its pure, ASA for perfect speed. So if the ASP decides to, accept this path, and then extend this path to its to its neighbor SC. So it will compute a, a verifiable routing commitment to publicly certify its routing intent over the next hop to the ASC. The construction of this FC is a straightforward symbol. It it it is signed by the, ASP saying, okay, I received an update from ASA and I'm waiting to extend this path to my peer to ASC. And afterwards, the ASP will put this into, a a new pass attribute and then, send the entire BTP update to its pure ASC. So at a very high level, FCPGP adopts a per athletes by the discipline. Because each AS only certifies its routing intent through on a two hop pass It does not care. It it does not consider any AS beyond its papers. This is different from, this is different from the per pass but this scheme like a PTV sec which the ASS has to recursively work back to the entire past to validate the past. So we we argue that with this thing, the b g FCB GGP has 2 benefits. The first is in case of full deployment, we show that FCBGP achieves the same security guarantee a BTV sec.

So as stated before, FC FCBGP does not modify the a s pass attributes instead, it defines a new transitivemassattributes to carry the FCs as a result, the lecans a s s which does not understand FCPGP can still forward this attribute to its peers without changing changing of any protocol. Therefore, we we see FCBGP is natively compatible with the BGP this is quite different from which replaces the AS pass attribute with a new, secure pass attribute. So with, so with FC, the, a PGP pass validation, is as follows, in full deployment where every every compass is will generate, a forwarding commitment and AS builds, simply check whether, there exist a FC for to certify each individual path leads on a path. If that's the case, this path is considered to be valid. In the case of a partial deployment, the a s has might traverse a antiquated zone containing a lack and say AS is that does not understand the FCPGP because we made this, past executed transit, this FCS can actually traverse through, this to reach ASD In that case, although ASD cannot authenticate the full pass, it can still use this access to authentic authenticate"

Uses some key dot key dot, data sets So we found the busiest AS, which is the AS generates the most the highest number of bgv updates. It needs to generate roughly 130,000,000 forwarding commitments in 1 month. We, and we benchmark this generation on our test batch, seeing okay, each generation of routing commitment is takes roughly about 30 mid a second. So if you do a simple math, it takes roughly 71 minutes to generate all this 130 and mini FCS, but actually these FCS are generated over a 1 month period. So the generation overhead seems quite less.

So basically, we, and we we show that because FCBGP is per perfect, the adversary may try to strategically combine and the apps is collected from different passes so that it can authenticate a first pass.

The authenticated pass rates can pass along the way while we and near the DGP path. Because, based on this observation, we prove an dilemma that if the consecutive deployment is sufficiently long that the entire pass is secured even if some of the on pass ASS are not upgraded, in reality, how was the, you know, actual benefits of this of this FCPGP in partial deployments and then we do some experiments as follows we shorten the AS according to their neighbors of their, according to the numbers of neighbors, and give a deployment rate are, we select the top r ASS to deploy FCBTP. Now for all the BTP updates, in the, in the Kira data set, we check whether the adversary can hijack our BGP updates by, by constructing a a forced but shorter a s pass and that then we report this hijack rate for different As because we've run the results, if, even give a very low deployment deployment rate, like, 5, 5.5 percent deforminate the FCB GB can reduce the high jack rate. From 40% to 20%, which is quite significant. Finally, I want to have a single slide for the, data play forwarding, validation is basically by propagating the verifiable routing commitment to the FCPTP. The on pass can learn the desired path on the data play. That means, in the future, if the a if this AS has received some traffic that that violates this this desired pass"

So FCBGP is built upon a unified primitive named verifiable routing commitment to enhance the security of both the control play and data play forwarding.

If you present and when you present it inside drops, I bet you will get a very good feedback also as to what happens when the security signatures, when you get a different kinds of those attacks, including the signatures that are being off. How do you sort of decentralize this from a bit of an r r or registries. And then you did mention a very interesting note hear about the performance in terms of scale, and convergence time it takes I have no idea, but I am sure that working group will ask you what kind of CPU that you run it on.

Okay. So, minimally, one of the problems you have is there's no guarantee that the device that you receive this from, the one attaching the signature. So that's that's at least one problem that's easy to solve. Yeah. Bigger problem is by comparison, this is a little bit closer to SOBGP in the problem space that it solves. Which is fine. No. That was a, proposal that worked its way through IPF. That biggest critique that, they had during the Beach B Sec Development experience, is that when they were working on this sort of thing, you have to prevent cases of replay which I don't believe your mechanism currently does. And it also, does not bind itself to the path. You at least say this is what you're doing. This also means that, spoofing is a little bit easier as well.

So Sometimes that works well and is efficient and then some implementations. It's not. There are 2 implementations. There is the implementation of DDoS And then there is the implementation of directed flow, spec rules. So all of this is Please, if you're an implementer, if your company's got it, contact me so we can try to find out what's the minimal set and will keep the base working group document as the a collection of all, but we're trying to cut off little pieces so we can get this out and the Internet. Questions, feedback. I wanted to give this introduction before you heard the flow spec of presentations, so you knew where we were with flow spec B2. Short, Questions? Nothing on my No comments. Great. Thank you, Sue. We got time back. Next presentations, B2Bflow spec for traffic and press action. Hello. Hello, everyone. I'm from Huawei. I will present a new BGP for those record traffic field action called the traffic compress next slide, please. While we require compressed network"

The debt volume on the network in trend is on rapidly. But the network investment growth is limited. Compressing is an effective technology to the same network resource Next slide, please. Why is field action for expression, compressed traffic required. First, the receiver and is notify the sender, which which package needed to be compressed and when to start data compression. Sector. If the depression capability of the re receive and is fought the the send send the end needed to be notified to stop compressing data. 3. The fluorescent algorithm decoded by the receiver and the sending send the end needed to be matched of 4. Periodically and change the algorithm or optimize the algorithm is required them, to sum up using Fluzbeck matching rules and traffic, press action, to trans to transmit a compression information between the receive and and the Sandy end is a very if effective method net, please."

We recommend, use using extended community to represent traffic comp compressed action. 1st, it has a general generic generic recur transective or extended commodity kind of agent. The the subtitle indicate indicated the flows back, traffic transaction. But and, 2 2 bytes, 2 bytes, global administrator filter included, compression algorithm type. And the 4 4 bytes local administrator field is reserved for future use and must be set to 0. That's all I had to say. Thank you, everyone. Okay. This is Jeff Haas. My comment on this or 2. First one is, this feature does not require flow spec version 2 because it is only being signaled by the addition of a new extended community. And the second point is that since it is only an in the community. Once you believe that your document has reached no stability,"

Okay. Are there any questions online or in the room? There are no further questions. Thank you for your presentation. final presentation for the day Our is Beachbee Flowspec extensions for path scheduling. Okay. There, there's his minor second, presentation. Simply either way or not take too much time. Okay. This is a BDP flows back retention for, And, for the similar to the the previous presidential for, yeah, because in the petal network, when we shut down some links on those to reduce the assumption, but it leads to the technology changes however, we can take the, advantage of predictability of changes and, stair traffic to the new parts in advance to prevent the park loss as we know, flows back provides a master to follow us to their traffic, their traffic into a specific parts, based on the traffic features. So we can do that, by flows back."

It's, conclude off for, 1, 1 by 2, tap on the 1 less under our airbrush at the time of information. And then we also defined the 2 formats of sharing information. For the periodical and uh-uh scenarios. And the the format is quite similar to the previous presentation. And the test page shows the procedures. Firstly, it's contora or know that you need to create a flow spec and the the other world has a to the head and underwent the head and resale. So it's, flows back away the shadow on time of information. It will stops the time, information. And the way I packets around a veil, if the park is arriving time matches, shadow on time of this, flows pack, and then it's a way of they are just a packet tool is specific tunnels, VPNs, or policies. Under the That's all. I promise our opinions welcome. Any questions online or in the room? I think this is very straightforward compared last time. Many of the same time it's still applying. So Look for more discussion on the mailing list. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. You for the presentation. We have, finished a little bit early after reclaiming some time.

No, actually, We have, Greg on the queue. Greg, feel free to speak up. Okay. guess Greg has nothing to say. I See you on Friday. What do you wanna say? Oh, boy. No. But I wonder what kinds of is a good tomorrow morning. Let me check. You guys. So I'm not gonna go there. I can do 8 o'clock but I have a 9:30 session. Do."
