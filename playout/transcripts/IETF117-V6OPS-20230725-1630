So we we see a number of XUs, and to deal with these XUs, their existing solutions If we look at these existing solutions, we k. I think if I dig that one thing in common. is, like, they all use some kind of like host isolation to deal with the exceeds. This host isolation will identify 5 of them from these solution is this subnet isolation or This is a unique prefix holes. And then there's also p to p link isolation, p tomp, proxy isolation, and CUA isolation. I think that why isolation will help to prevent some NB issues because Again, I think that, you know, when we look at the cost, isolation, of course, will reduce multicast isolation will also reduce the number of holes that you'll need to You'll need the tool trust."

So this is why this isolation approach can help Here, We would like to point out that We are not saying that you must always do host isolation. But in the end, we give some guideline, and we believe that it will be helpful. before your deployment. to go through this guideline and then depending on your deployment scenario. you can find out whether, for example, is multicast ex fuel. in your environment. If it's a 2 network thing, maybe it is and you also consider that. But if it's not, then, you know, you don't need to worry about the potential issues. So we believe that such a guideline will be useful for for And because these five isolation method are not independent, So when we combine them, we don't get, you know, 2 to the power of 5 or the 32 different combination. Actually, there's only 6 meaningful combination, and we list them here, these are the subnet isolationplusp2plink. So this one subnetplusp2npandsubnetwhichjuststhatmeeting. So so These three isolation are basically layer 3 isolation, meaning that they all employ some kind of unique graphics per host They also They also do the with a different degree of l2isolation ranging from, you know, p to p, which is complete L2 link isolation to no no link isolation. the next three isolations, proxy isolations, GUA, and no relation at all. These three are basically, you know, no layer 3 isolation. However, they also have different degree of a layer 2 isolation."

So, you know, it cover all bases This may give us more confidence to the guideline because it cover our base is And also, also, the For each of these isolation method, Way leaks the applicable scenario that you can see if, okay, you know, this is applicable to your deployment scenario or not, We also list the entry requirement in order for you to use a particular isolation method what kind of law requirement you must meet. And then, you know, if you use this particular isolation method, what are the remaining issues and solution. Generally speaking, you know, The stronger isolation you apply then you will have a higher entry requirement. But then you have fewer remaining issues, you need fewer solution to deal with the remaining So overall, the the con the final solution may actually be simpler. I think that this is the the purpose of this guideline, you know, trying to give you Like, you will choose, you know, a suitable isolation method. So in this version, way, 2 a big update first weight, point out that, you know, certain NDX you're only in certain environment.

As a result, this is reduce multicast, this is some sort of layer to installation. So this way, I think that the relationship between proxy isolation is relationship to L3 isolation, L2 isolation become clear it help us to see that the the 6 isolation method cover all bases. And the last one change is, like, way we point out that unique prolific per host our L3 isolation will reduce privacy. So if privacy is very important, then maybe you want avoid using unique prefix per host you want to, you know, in addition to Unix prefix per host, you might want to introduce some other mechanism. to deal with privacy. So overall, we believe that the now relatively stable and way hope for more review and comment And we want to thank Pascal for other people some pretty thorough review in the previous round and we're planning to ask for a working group last call, in the near future.

So I thought it would make sense to just present them back to back. and the The whole point of that document is to work on a architecture for doing ipv6 over in the EMA network. IPD 6 and the in particular is suited for point to point and transit networks, but it is explicitly written in the document that is not designed to support NBMA. As it goes, NBMA has been a long, long, long standing promise. As what I sent all all this recently on knock. long promise from V Six, which was actually never helped. it's it could be time considering the shape that modem networks take. to actually tackle that problem. and some examples of networks which happened to to be in DMA. wireless networks, as you can find in OCD for about 11, or in IoT networks. That's where this work started. But it's also the shape that modern infrastructure take will take a big take now. in Compass Networks And Enterprise Networks.

So the Azure is probably for ipv6 to catch up. Wits Wits what is already done. Actually, it's not reinventing the wheel. what we propose here is ipv6leveledadaptation of exactly what's WIfi is doing to extend the VSS into an ESS. It's a multiyear network. You have wireless and then you've got the Ethernet back end. And basically there is function at the edge by the access point. That's what it is. since the the Wi Fi stay registers to association to the the the learning bridge that is the AP, proactively before the the mac addresses needed so that it's there it's needed, then you avoid the broadcast. So the the same architecture actually relates to the way a friendly worked in the mid nineties you did the SPFV 2 and the point to multi point design. What we are doing here is the exact emulation of p2mp IPD6. The draft starts, and we'll see that with with Why we have a prime and effectively the bottom line of that is the way IPD 6ND works. And in particular, the way Slack works. is not friendly, to modern infrastructure that need to know which IPV 6 addresses were at every point of time. We need to know all the IPV address using the subnet, and we need to know where they are. Because after that, there is an infra that's being set up like EVPM, and to have a correct view of the network in EVPM, you need to have a proactive full perfect knowledge of each address in its location. Otherwise, you will turn on the back the wrong place. It's not gonna work."

If there is a device that you missed snooping slack, then either you don't reach that address or you have to broadcast in the format work, which could be subnet that extends of our continents. So that's basically why we are looking for a method that will ensure that the infrastructure knows for sure at every point of time not only which mac addresses on my well, every mac address is on Wi Fi, but also where every IP level 6 address his. His. His. His. Now the draft is another number of mismatches, but mean, please go through the draft. Next slide, please. Next one. Oh, that's the 1. Okay. I'm sorry. I I the instance switch. So one of the big bottom lines of that draft going from transit to NBMA. is to realize that it was actually a design point for V Six. at the time where we wanted probably that the transition from b 4 to b 6 would not be too hard. It was a design point to Design v 6 the same was before design and d, the same was opt. like, in particular and the most important for us here. either one to one mapping between the broadcast dominantly or 2. what we call a subnet ethyl asymmetric And that's how you can do a look at with Oh. and with nd.

Then you realize that the subnet, which is the full building, And the broadcast domain, which is this room because that's where the printer is. are not necessarily a good match. you would really want to decouple this too. I have the same thing with EVPN. Right? If I do a broadcast, in one of my campuses, I don't want for for looking at the printer. I want to to, again, find my printer in Compass, not somewhere else in my corporate network. k. So The bottom line is if we want to be able to build any network we like, there is a huge value end decoupling, The layer 2 concepts from the layers 3 concepts And this way, you can really operate V Six the way you like independently of whether this subnet is composed of a single type of links, multiple type of links, like connect the IoT devices through 54 onto my Same subnet as some normal host. You can build anything you like if you decouple the subnet from the broadcast domain. and even from the type of macatras. passcode, you have 3 more minutes. Yeah. But I I pass my message over it. Okay. So so the quick status on document but it's mostly for consumption by 6 months. But just to give you history, so there was started with a a draft specifically about wireless.

But it started with document explaining why ipv6 indeed Slack in particular. are not fit to Alice.

So we're going through overlays, a sustainability, privacy, middle box, there are all sorts of issues which are listed there. next slide. Then comes the core of the architecture. that's one thing that I didn't really find in any IP before ipv6 document, it's probably a time we define them is what are those things that we call links interface lots and proxies. So I try to come up in a definition, and really, we need a group to agree on some definition. So this is starting point for that. The key thing is because now it is not just a plane mapping a plane copy of whatever the hell 2 guys do. then we have to define what we want them to be. It's no more, oh, take your broadcast domain. That's your sadness. Gone. Okay? So what is my What's my name? If you look at many in in many cases, we have defined the link not to be a radio because it doesn't mean anything. radio can connect to those guys and the next second to those guys. If I did that on my MAC address on the link clockwise based on my MAC address, I time, we call 0. 5 minutes later, I'm far far away.

Let's point. please look up in I mean it. Okay. I'm I'm done. So after that, we present a framework is basically how we've already done most of that. in a more specific context, and we want to generalize this, But at least we we give a a a proven framework of things which were done with existing ROCs And there are actually millions of nodes which do exactly that. are not deployed in PCs. Right? They are deployed in this very city. If you see PGENEW written somewhere, you will see those things implemented in them. but millions of nodes prove that it works. Next one. And that's my last slide, the last piece of these documents actually in capability statement, I've just returned the ones from wireless when they say is drive still tainted with wireless. So so you you still see wireless in there. but it's really applicable to many other types of net. So my conclusion here because I need to give one is there is a missing link between a host talking site to a DHCP to get notarized, to get a prefix, or whatever. and the routers which need to do something out of that. Whether you ask a prefix, whether you ask an address, whether you talk of that rest of that prefix. There is still this gap between DHCP, which is relative to give it to you, and the rotors which are I have to trust you for honing it. And part of the things we have to do and this draft does, is closing that gap, ensuring that everybody is in sync.

Romingo. please be concise as we are running out of time, Yeah. So so two two points. I think, first of all, architecturally, This draft is focused on ND, but Everything you said is actually not specific to ND. ND is an application that uses broadcast multicast. And there are lots of those. There's multicast there's bonjour. There's all sorts of stuff on link discovery. Lots of applications roll their own stuff. Yep. Yep. and all of them have the same sort of properties. And So -- I just said, no. Actually, I gave the example that you gave of and the the the need of might be just limited to this room, whereas the need for ND could be the whole subnet. So I'm talking about IP p application. So you're right, but not to actually want to decouple what Bose of CNCs and what IPC is. That's exactly one of the best. That's why I'm saying this document is too focused on ND. If you wanna change if you wanna say if you wanna define, like, multi scope subnets, that's a big architecture problem, kind of like researchy territory. But, like, I don't think you can just focus on ND because ND is just one application that uses essentially kind of it uses flooding. It it's sort of a, like, a a service discovery I understand that. The question is problem if you think about it. You know, I wanna discover an idea. The difference that you don't seem to see here is Andy is the one that needs to match the broadcast domain quote and quote with the subnet. whereas most of the others that I'm aware of, they're happy with the broadcast domain that layer gives them and actually being able to give them a layer to the man which fits their needs broadcast domain and layer 2 that fits their needs and still be able atiplayer to do IPV 6 the way we want. actually, what defines the subnet is the scope of ND.

I'm not saying it's never happy. Right? I'm saying there are good cases now where it's not. And the same example apply to other broadcast apps. The other the other thing was The other thing is, like, what this document is lacking is the is the for ND specifically now, it is the balance between sort of hosts and network infrastructure where there's an, like, unwritten assumption or maybe written assumption in this document. network must be aware at all times of everything that a host might be wanting to do, what what sort of IP address it might have. And Slack was kind of intentionally designed in an opposite way where, like, the host actually conform an IP address without telling the network. Yeah. and their advantages. I agree with that.

But as soon as you start charging COVID 4, there will be some very unpleasant surprises. Right? It was another thing which I broke immediately. when I deploy the B Six only guest network. Right? all those devices which were relying on not in IP before to provide connectivity through some hidden subsystems. Next slide, please. So basically, yeah, illustration. What's happened? You have a dual stack network. You have a physical box inside it. It's for port, w open WRT device. which will Get a b 6 address using Slack. We'll get before address via DHCP. We'll do not, and we'll send IV 4 traffic, providing free for connectivity to whatever hidden inside. now, I'm going to my network SSH to our outer term of IP before. The router still gets the 6 address, But there is no connectivity for whatever is behind the route. Right? So unless we require those devices to always use for workslot, Right? And keep the phone network downstream and not it to upstream. those devices behind the router are totally broken. Right? definitely not desirable. So If we start providing PD, So, actually, even before we start talking about these drafts 3 years ago, I realized that my network, I actually should provide PD by default ideally."

I would like to do since now it's a route to my prefix. I would like to be able to roam in this hotel and not necessarily stay attached to the same link. See? And so is it something that that you have in mind on how to do it? Because it's not useful. So I think we kind of indirectly saying it somewhere in the draft? Because I think the draft does mention VXLAN scenarios as a use case, So, basically, instead of having 25 routes right, for each address my home, Micah. Right?

And if the network magically knows how to move you, it can move you. Right? Normally, the like, the the other part of the answer is, like, Normally, the prefix is tied to the link local address, which is kind of scoped to a link.

Is it backups? Is it pre staging data before analysis? Is it analysis products? that have to go off for few for future work. And then to play nice with the world, we're still sprinkling in some amount of entropy bits into here. And then we take all these labels, collect them, I in near real time off the routers via IP fix or s flow, and present a aggregated statistics that led us understand the traffic patterns of what's going on. And then we have a registry which maps all this together. that decodes this. So next slide, please. So so And this is for the laundry list of the way I think. Like, is this legitimate? Right? So there there's there's well documented use cases for how we're going to use the IPV 6 flow label, particularly for as entropy into ECMP and lag ashes but 6437 says it's only recommended that the hosts use a uniform distribution and keep that as random as possible. Clearly, we're not doing that when we're we're closer values for anyone given use case from a given oustached And RC 82100 that says as well, can you know, you need to treat these packets in the network as a single flow, which is essentially what we're A host is asking by setting these labels."

Well, I think the IRCs do document sort of some thoughts on those lines of you'd you'd Performance should not be dependent upon this and and what's gonna happen if someone's studying these randomly. and intermediate routers doing ECP or lag, which is the predominant use case at this point. these flow labels if they're not set to 0. is to use a 32 ball.

We wanted to document exactly what we did and how it's working, And then you hit the next slide. And then sort of how we got to this point, which is sort of a lightweight alternative analysis of the things we thought about first that seemed to really be a better fit. So obviously, hot by hot options, well documented in a I've got a bunch of references in the draft, highly problematic, potential for drops if the router doesn't have to do with it even though it seems like we want a hop by hop option because went through Otter to tell us what it did. with the packet, but it doesn't quite line up right. Destination up options kinda make more sense because we are talking about end to end signaling of intent for what was this flow about. we have socket API problems where, you know, a user's unpublished user space application can't just slap on a destination ops and header and column a day. They're also buried deeper in the packet. So for a you know, fix pipeline ASIC to grab it and export it over. IPFix may not be possible.

They are using employment deployment But in most of the cases, they have some drawbacks, Not all the corner cases are covered. So the idea is to document through our draft all the available methods, the mechanisms you find in the field. discuss the pros and cons Try to, let's say, go through the history of at the reasons why they were introduced and accept good and deployed in the field that and see, let's say, the operational impact about them. One important point that you see it's underlined in the slide, is that we try to give the point of view of the entire site, meaning that It's the an architecture, a framework which is owned operated maybe by a single organization, for example, an enterprise That has the full rights defined at policies, the routing mechanisms, the filtering procedures, for that specific network, which can be arbitrarily complex.

But we like to have your feedback and see if this is something can fit in our draft format. And I would say that's it. So I see the first question here. So the You say that ULA is An option if end to end is not a requirement. it's actually not an option because it violates the it actually violates the business requirements. the business requirements typically involve you you shouldn't like, you you need to run IP before. and you don't need to modify the hosts. So ULA does not work. Because at you you pointed out that you need to modify the policy table. if you take any commercial operating system, or or some of the most popular ones You can't do that. And so in order to change this, for example, in android and iOS, you have to get, like, the the vendors to change so it's not actually an option in the real world. Right? That's that's very important to know it. And I think also it's it's sort of like a violation of 193. because 4193 basically says that for global connectivity, you need global addresses. So I don't think we can actually publish this because it's a violation of the ULA's back and also doesn't actually meet the requirements. because I think having a requirement that, like, it should work with IP before, should be a requirement. and not modifying all your hosts should also be requirement because it's not really a a feasible option. So I think we should remove ULA plus MPT 66b6 and the ULA Plus not 66. You one of the questions on this slide is, like, less conversion less available solutions. think we need to kick those out and say that this is an unsolved problem that needs to be solved. Okay? So quick answer."

Those probably aren't in widespread use yet as Sorento's hinting, but I think it's worth dot mentioning them. and any design decisions that were made as those were evolved to be the way they are mentioned earlier for the packet marking for the WLCG, we didn't use extension or the whole the whole extension head is because of certain issues and maybe documenting those is also a good thing to show that negative side as as well as the the whole story if you like.

We wanna be very generic, And so we're just planning to list use cases whether or not they are good use cases or not is just to define them.

On the other hand, by the definition of extension headers, they're extensible So we really don't want to just say these are the use case. This is a mechanism that we want to say, is continuously evolving. So How do you balance these? I guess that's the real question. Yeah.

I have a partial answer to that. It it and the answer is it's possible to make extension headers work. and some people do make them work. And having a document that says these are use cases that are deployed today, is useful if you want to go to someone who maybe is not very familiar with ipv6 and says, like, oh, why would I need to even do this extension header thing. Why don't I just drop all of them? Because that's it. It looks obviously insecure. and, like, this is not something I know from my paid PV Four experience and, like, this is terrible. Right?

Like, if an ISP wants to support just, like, handing out a big chunk, only at the top level. First, like, there's a difference, I think, between ISPC route and something else. because the next piece here, we're is probably, like, in in some cases has to be the first top because it's got, like, an on Ethernet interface and, like, it it you can't, like, put it behind anything else. So that could have, like, for that type of box, hierarchical does make sense to say, okay. Like, want a 60 okay. Have add it. You want all of my address space? Have add it or something. So that might be That might make sense. So -- Okay."

Eric, who doesn't know he's being channeled, but it would be nice to express how you could, like, at least, not break multi homing? In, for example, a simple case where there's, like, one link at the top. with 2 Reuters and say that everything else is beyond is out of scope. At least, because I think You could say that, like, the problem of rooting is out of scope, and you can say only about how you distribute addressing. Yep. And that's, like because realistically, once you've distributed the arresting, I think, you know, it's not that different from, like, something where you're on the link with 2 routers. Maybe not. I don't know. I'll think on that. I just get nervous about opening this can. Definitely don't try to solve the general problem. saying that this won't break at least No. Definitely would be. But, like, cases would be nice. Okay. can maybe get on board with that. McCallai, Brinson. So as per the draft here, we're discussing before, but notes or whatever ended up calling them also requesting PD. Is there some advice there to give them here or do you want to No. This one is really it's a good point. We're this one we're really talking about routers. term requesting it and I'm specific about routers. So this goes more to the case that Ted talked about with snack routers needing to get these. Okay. because I think it so I'm mostly been involved in, like, opened up your team and so on. And I I don't know if they actually do this multi slash 64. So getting this out as an you know, this is how we think it should be done to everybody. I think that's very Yeah. It's not in there now. We I played a little bit. We're we're working on getting some into the open WebRTCM purple. As far as I know, the default they're shipping is to give a the hurricane model giving a larger one, and then it starts to subdivide them up. that's the strategy they've chosen. So if we're going for the flat model, that's the advice then I think that's good advice to give everybody so that they know what they what to expect when they"
