But he said that he will provide, comments, what needs to be changed, concretely, to address his comments later today. So we are giving him this day to provide this, comments I discussed tomorrow with Bob 1, if that happened and what the output is and either it goes to the AD as a current state as it is in the current state or we address his comments. We can still address his comments during AD review during ISG review, but it would be better if we have resolved this. Before it goes to the AD, that's why we delayed it or I delayed it by by a day. Generalized ECN. Is something which is, next in the queue after we have shipped acute ECN, I think We will have a working group last call on generalized ECN. We have a presentation for that.

I was noting that that we previously said that CTP and TCP would m would have a special liaison. I think this has become a three way cooperation program now because there are certain things in the CTP, which are very similar TCP, which probably needs to be coordinated with you. We probably also have to coordinate CCWG. Is that what the everybody here understands if there are TCP like bits in SCTP, which there are, then when they get changed, then we have to coordinate with TCPM. There a congestion control bits, then we'd probably go to coordinate with CCWG. We all talk to one of those, so I don't really suggest the charter. Changed in any way. If we understand this. Yeah.

And you can see on that plot there of, the low completion time with and without TCN, and plus plus this one's without you get those One second time outs. Where the sin gets lost could be less than that if the RTO timeout is less, but And one second is recommended, and with with with ACN Plus plus you don't see any of that. It's all down in the thoughts at the bottom. And you get, similar things with the other control packets that was is just a very quick recap Next. So this is the full set of control packets that RFC 3168 says should not be ECN capable. You can see in the in the second column there RSC 3168 apart from data. Everything is not ECT, not using cable transport, And then This draft is the next three columns, and it depends whether accret ECN has been negotiated or not for 2 of them. That is the SIN and the Pure Act. Where If it has not been negotiated, you still can't put this incapable on it. And then the last column gives the congestion response. I'm not gonna go into the congestion response. Now, but that's on on this slide for the and this is a copy of the table that's in the in the draft, Be Reason for not being able to put these young cable on CNN pure rack."

However little footnote to, says that it can be either accurate, easy and negotiated, or some other. So measure I think Michael Scharf suggested could just set your congestion your initial your initial window to 1, and that would be it. Safe enough. As another as an alternative if you were not using accuracy and if you were just using 3168. And finally, just to be clear, ACN plus plus is the name of that the vertical that in the draft name is generalized ECN. It's an experimental graft. And although it says you can set ECT on all these you don't have to to do the experiment. You could you could select different ones and see what happens individually. You don't, you know, you don't have to go to the whole hope to do it. And we may find that one of them doesn't work and the others do, and then result of the experiment will be that we but do that one, but we do all the others. Okay. Next. So the draft is in, three main parts, at least the specification part of the draft of Section 3.1, which, sorry, section 3.2 was was the previous slide. Then there's also section 63.13.3, which cover what middle box do and what receivers do. So the sender was the previous slide. What middle boxes do, like firewalls this draft doesn't actually say. It just repeats what RFC 8311 said, which was an update to 3168, which is a proposed standard update, not just an experimental one. It essentially said, this this, experiment is coming up don't see any reason why"

There isn't actually any evidence that firewalls are doing that, but making it clear. And at least as clear as it can be to find 1 RFC in 9000 or something and and find the right one for a firewall spelled up. Right. So then, for the receiver, The questioner is if you're a RFT 31 68 receiver, what do you do if you receive the ECN cable control packet when you weren't expecting anyone to send you one. And, The the answer is this draft says you should accept it. If you're And he's in capable sender who's who's an ECN plus by sender then you definitely must accept it because you're sending those sort of things as well. So And then the the bulleted section there tells you the specifics of each one, which I'm not gonna go into. Just cover the table for this recap. And obviously the draft gives you more specifics, specifics, Next. And finally, for this recap, before I get into the latest changes, That's a section after the specification that gives all the rationale for what's been specified. And most of it is about rebutting arguments in I've seen 3168 for why you should not. Make these control packets easy and k. We'll with substitute arguments for why you should. Right? And, I won't go into all those because they're all very specific to each case, and that's why the draft is quite long. Because the spec itself is quite short, but then all the rationale is long."

    "text": "The Maine two arguments that it knocks down from RS3061 3168 are the reliability argument and going to batdos attacks. I will go into those as a as a recap, And, certainly, if anyone is wanting to review this draft. I would like to encourage you to review some of the reasoning, not just check whether the spec is correct. And see if you agree with this reasoning. So the first one is that original ECN spec 31 68 said you must not set ECT on a packet. If lots of that are seeing mark on that packet, would be detected as an indication of congestion. So that assumes that something up stream of the loss as marked at CE and then later on in the path, something else has dropped Alright. And so it's saying don't market ECN capable so that it might gonna see Mark if later on it might get locked. And then you wouldn't be able to detect that you had to see Mark But in a lot of cases, with these control package, you can't tell whether the control packet was lost either. You can't see the indication of congestion due to a loss either. So it's sort of a bit I don't know what the word is. But but purists to say will mustn't said ECC on something that might not be seen. You couldn't see it anyway. So, The argument forward here is more a do no extra harm argument. That you can put anything capable on something if if It's Better because it's easy and capable. Even if you can't detect that it was lost. Yep. Okay? And the second argument about does attacks was that you shouldn't put ATM cable on packets if it might help an attacker strengthen their attack. And again, this is a bit backwards"

    "startTime": "00:20:00",
    "text": "in that, you're telling someone in an RFC not to do is do something that will strengthen their attack. But of course, an attacker doesn't have to do what it says in RSC. So you're actually ending up doing is telling good actors not to do something which bad actors will still do, and then the good actors don't get the benefit. So pay. It's better to allow the good actors to get the benefit and then have the protections against the bad actors. In the network and in at receivers. And we already have those protections in AQMs and in in in TCP Receivers. So so that's that's the argument there. Next, Right. So the recent changes, I've split them into technical and editorial. Couple of slides on technical first. We had an additional check for duplicate acknowledgement and next slide explains this in much greater detail. We've just added the words for all detection out duplicate detection algorithms, because previously it implied it was just for the lost it, for loss detection. Of deeming whether there's been a loss. I'll more about that on the next slide. The There was a lot of informative texts about No. Sorry. There there's a little of informative text about other transport protocols and how they might want to use this approach. One being STTP, you know, we've just been mentioning it mirrors a lot what's in TTP. And, just recently Ron Stewart, updated that draft So the description in this draft now says it still mirrors what RSC 3168 said, whereas before it essentially said it was just a long expired draft because It's it's hasn't been updated for I don't know, some"

And finally, I was going through checking I covered everything that had ever been said on the mailing list about this And, I found an email from Michael Scharf that I hadn't dealt with which mentioned that we should put in the, security considerations that if you have different he's been capable control packets in different implementations it might might might might think of anything easier. So I just added that as a statement in these security considerations, and whether you want fingerprinting or not is up to you. Jackson from the flight. Just clarifying the SEB I got stuff. So I just submitted the the old document formatted in XML to with a note, Content changes. So it reflects the very old state, whether it still makes sense or not is a different thing. The the point is that, There is some interest to do work on ECM with the CTP, course, it's used in WebRTC, and, then you can make use of that. So in the future, it will provide an appropriate way of using ease of of doing with their CTP right now. It reflects what what was there 10 years ago or whatever. Okay.

So as background, it's about a acknowledging acknowledgements and, The the problem is that When you've got ECN capable, pure acts. We have It's in feedback that could allow those to be acknowledged in certain cases, one being shown on this slide. So you get an act of an act Then Anything that is looking for jupacs. Might find that that's a due pack if if some data has already been sent in the other direction. So in this the case of this slide, you've got sort of send us sending everything in one direction. The red x that the path is all congested. That's why they're all red, not black, And then, Just as those read it. Act start to get act. The direction of data switches, and you start getting data from B2a, and then those acts of acts look like they could be due packed. So way we dealt with this was The accurate e stands back says you have to send occasional acts when you're getting a lot of congestion marking on acts."

And and and and s n plus plus is such a spec. So that gives 3 conditions for setting those pure act setting ECT on those pure acts. It must have succeeded in negotiating to sack. Must have successfully renegotiated accurate ECN, and it must apply a check for the due back on incoming pure acts. In all its algorithms, that says if there isn't any sack on it, Despite Saka having been negotiated, it's not counted as a due pack. Right? So it's all quite complicated, but it only applies to the post that's originally sending those because that's the one that might get confused what it receives. That's why all that doesn't have to be in the accurate ECN spec, it only has to be in the spec where you're sending the ECN capable pure now. Marcus just emailed as as as you heard this morning and his case seems to be now although he's promising more information later today, holding us all on a knife edge. But, absence of a SAC might be due to a supporting SAC, but not the SAC. Alright. So you've got sacket RC 2000 I tell you some to be Yeah. And then desac was like of RC 2019 something, I think. So like a few months after that, and then you've got passport would you know, 25 years or something accurate ECNC.

    "text": "Michaelfer is John Croft from the University of Cambridge. Next, please. So, 1st of all, a quick look at the motivation for the draft. Delay decks is a widely used mechanism, which is intended to reduce protocol overhead However, it may also contribute to some optimal performance in some scenarios. Such as so called large congesting windows scenarios meaning a congestion window size much greater than the MSS. Where saving more than 1 of every 2 acts may help improve performance. And so called small congesting window scenarios, meaning a congestion window size up to the order of 1 MSS where delayed acts may incur too much delay may limit congestion window growth and so on. Thanks. So, this is the main option format, where the r field carries the act rate, which is requested by the sender, currently a maximum value of 127 and there's the special case of r equal to 0, which indicates a request of an immediate act. While keeping the steady state Uhrate. Thanks. Thank you. So on the status of the draft, it was adopted in February. So today I'm presenting version 3. N, it aims to address the comments we see from the last IETF meeting, and also it incorporates feedback from quick at frequency draft authors. Thanks for the comments and feedback. And now let's go through the updates. So the first updates are in section 3.1 and title send the behavior. So we have first updated one paragraph. It's just a couple of minor updates, which are shown in red. So to give the whole context the dot paragraph reads as a TCP sender does not communicate the value of r. Responding to an amount of data bytes to be acknowledged that once by the receiver, greater than the last known receive a window size or greater than the current conjunction window size. So here, the focus was trying to make it explicit that we refer to the latest"
  },
  {
    "startTime": "00:34:01",
    "text": "values for these variables. Then we have also added a couple of sentences in the context of mentioning the use of r equal to 0. Where we state that requesting an immediate act from the receiver can help reduce the time it takes to detect and don't recover from packet loss. Just listen. So, then in section 3.2, receive a behavior, we have updated one paragraph. This is after a comment by Christian. To emphasize the autonomy of the receiver to transmit an act. So, the updates in this paragraph are in red. So now it reads us following the behavior specified in RFC 56 it won in order to aid the sender in segment loss detection and repair. Our option capable receiver should send a duplicate accurately when an auto for their segment arrives. And that is regardless of the act rate requested by the sender. Also, we have added, another paragraph, also following 56 state 1, that the TAR option capable receiver should send an immediate act when the incoming segment fills in all or part of a gap in the sequence space, and that's also regardless. Of the accurate requested by the sender. And still in the same section, we have also added especially that in any case, as specified in RFC 9 293, the delay for NAC must be less than 0.5 seconds. So this is to make it explicit that the maximum delay for an act still holds. In this case, Then, we have also a couple of minor updates in section 5.3. Entitled lower frequency of RTD samples. So this is in section 5, which focuses on stretch acts which may happen when is used with a large value we have updated one paragraph and we have extracted the the the main part that we have modified with the updates actually shown in red here."

    "startTime": "00:36:00",
    "text": "So, what we state here now is that in order to limit this issue, meaning lower frequency of RTT samples is a consequence of stretch we've added that when there are segments in flight, send the needs to trigger a sufficient number of acts per round trip. The previous versions instead of round trip, it was RTT. By the way, thanks a lot to Ian for helping, double checking the paragraph and helping wordsmith the text. Finally, there are also some updates in section 6. Which is entitled changing their rate during the lifetime of a TCP connection, So the new content is in red as well here. So we explained already in the previous versions that the sender may notice that the exit receives cover more segments than the accurate requested. This may be for two reasons. One of them was already explained in the section, perhaps act decimation is occurring in route. So if the sender knows or suspected that's what's happening, it may want to reduce the at frequency to reduce the residual workload and network load. Up to the act destination point. However, there may be, second reason which is the receiver using large receive of load. If the receiver sorry, if the sender knows or suspects that this is what's going on, perhaps it may want to increase the frequency to compensate for the impact of LRO on the flow of x. So, I think there's Murray in the queue. And actually, that's it. So this was the last slide. You. So Gary Fair has, Okay. And, firstly, why why why 4? Why is 4 a magic number for for the number of RTTs you can wait for feedback from the remote end. No. I mean, I I I get 1 as an example, but why is for in the document words for control."

So yeah, I don't know if perhaps it can be improved or just keep it to I think one is a common millimeter there, I don't know. Okay. Alright. We we can't find the same thing in 2 working groups. But, one one is clearly a common way of causing a feedback loop, which you get feedback. Typically once per RTG. I accept that it doesn't have to be. 4 is a bigger number. I don't know that waiting for 4 RTTs to respond to an event is a safe way of doing it or not, but you might have in information if you do them it would be good to kind of add something here. I don't like the word significance, and I like the extra text, but the extra text was also not very clear. So I just maybe we can hack a little bit more on it, perhaps, or you could say, no. Yeah.

Going to present, our draft, which is, join work with Alej, but I want to and, to my region, my colleagues, Next slide, please. So the context of this work is, just a short summary for us to what to speak is, TCPA is an extension that provides integrity protection and to, TCP packets. And, as the current, documents define it, the cryptographic keys that provides this protection, they're set up out of band. And so what we saw is that when when a TLS session is used on top of TCP. There is an opportunity to derive those keys from the TLS handshake and kind of help the deployment of, CPO. So this draft is really proposing a way to achieve this. Next slide. So What, let's go over an example of use first. So happens is when the connection, when the TCP connection starts, It uses their folds. Key that is specified in DID. So the default key doesn't really provide any sore form of protection, but it exercise the fact that TCPA or can go through"

So whether TCP options are protected by the by the extension or not there is obviously, authentication algorithm to negotiate and the KDF to use So all that is happening during the TLS and, Jake, next slide. And then when the handshake succeeds, the server can in its responses, the server can, already known study that has prepared during KTE And then, on the, on the, Last segment here, we have the next ID of the keys that is using those securing entities that we direct from the TLS. Next slide. And then when the TLC handshake really is really finished, they go can use those secret keys and they they are secure keys to protects and verify. Booth packets. I mean, I guess going both ways. Okay. Next slide. So, we our use case is also BGP in the same way that TCPAO also included a DGP as one of their use case. We're also working on on, using TLS a type of BGP. That is my colleague Tomada is working on this more specifically. But what we foresee and what we would also like to hear from us is that in this mode, any long lived TCP connection that he's using TLS can benefit from TCPAO. And so this could work for, ACPS, but also, for a DNS over TCP or DNS or anything that is using TCP. That could benefit from, from this, this work."

One of the obvious things is that we will need to us this within TLS, but first, we wanted to here from the TCP users and maintainers whether This is something that they're interested in. But we need to discuss interactions with other TCP extensions. So there is CCP fast open. There could also be MPTCP. The size of the options, mean, and and we speak speak, there could be some conflict there. Of course, But then there is also this interaction with TLS mechanisms, such as our case book. Those will happen in TLS. Of course. And then there is, one thing we didn't specify or proposed a way for is that expected to renew the securities at some point. To do some kind of key updates when you have really long lived connection and you need to renew those keys, is not done in the in the document. This is something, of course, we have to to work for.

It can flash the any pending buffer at the center and receiver by sending a modifying that the sequence member. To the FWA sequence number. We'll see how the FWE sequence is, updated Next week, please. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. This was the, second drop second question of the draft, we had update in September after the previous comments on the rest of Next slide, please. Yeah. Oh, we had modified, TCP header as it indicated, in the, TCP reserve bid And, this doesn't need any negotiation because if the receiver, don't understand it is PFWFAG or in a mailbox or any layer doesn't understand, it can simply go the, field and the normal discipline of patients will continue. If the, receiver understands that there is a w flag set, the receiver can, see the sequence number and updates, its expected sequence number. With the, received sequence number from this and send that document back to the sender. Once the sender receives the acknowledgement back at the sender side, then only sender can flushes, sender buffer. From this, and it's a local buffer. And the receiver buffer can, flash only after receiving the yeah, when it is it receives the TCP E FWA, etcetera. The strength is"

We have, introduced the new sequence number 3, called FWS called pass window sequence number, which will be set to the maximum, data sent from the TCP Center block. Center side. So when the, sender conflicts the TCPfw black. The sender can set set it the sequence number, to the FWA sequence number. So that the receiver can receive the the sequence number up to which he can plush it's buffer and then send that judgment back to the sender. So the So the so in this way, there is no negotiation required. And it's a, a receiver is not compatible, with the updated this option, we can, it's supposed to ignore it. Or any of the middle boxes or professionals Okay. Next, please. And, we had, addressed the issue in the middle boxes. If the middle box has a stateless box, it can, sim simply forward the sequence number. If the middle box is modifying the sequence number in between He can, choose to update the sequence number according to the map the sequence number in between the between the to between center and the serial. And to address the TLS case where we had received a comment on for a TLS case. Because we the SIP operations, the MS we use, don't use the TLS operations. I think we choose to we can it is up to application when to apply the FW F TwilioClack so that TLS applications can ignore the F TwilioClack. But still, we are discussing how, we can enable for that TLS."

We see that a good improvement in the good good good put of the, TCP connection because we are, not transmitting the unnecessary segments to the network. When the when the, application doesn't need the, data anymore. Yeah. Next slide, please. And, we have given an example in the 89. Draft? Where how can you enable the TCP FWA bit? For the application, it is just simply configuration whenever it want to flushed the recipe. Data at the sender side, but it doesn't guarantee that it is flushed from the it's buffered because it depends on the receiver side acknowledgement. Yeah. Next minute, please. Yeah. We have received a good amount of the comments for the strapped, and we are looking for, any further improvements on the draft. And, we also seek further review on the draft. Yeah. Thank you. And Yeah, sir. Have any questions? Test. Are there any questions? Hi. Can I go ahead? Can I go ahead with my question Yes? Alright. Hi. So you just mentioned, that it will flash all all the data. At some cases, the endpoints like they may want to reinitiate after SIP transaction a reinitiated SIP transaction after a time out So then this flag will increase the, the time for the session establishment for the next sessions. So how would you handle that? Yeah. Application, it is application choice when it it you want to flush Deborah"

But if application declares that the session is completed and a time load, then only it can initiate the flash from the application side. Okay. And this is kind of in a territory of inter interlayer protocol. Communication. Scret? Yes. Yes. It is a it is a intent of the application to flash the buffer. Okay. Thanks. You are? Hi. I have a two questions. So I'll just ask both of them and, So first, in case of, head of line blocking and I don't know about much about, your particular use case but let's say if it's about transmission, you're likely to have filled, the entire receive buffer. So if you want to do this operation, you will at least have to spend 1 RTT, to clear the receive buffer so that you can transmit more. I think that's and the Right. And this, so I think just to make sure that I understood it correctly. Now second question is, how is it gonna look for the user? Of, I mean, traditional TCP stream sockets, or the application that's using it on the receive side can't just use, like, a regular TCP receives. They need to, like, be relying and receive message. I mean, just what what's the user experience user interface for this Yeah. Part of the first first, first question that is this Yes. Definitely needs one article to complete the flashing between the receiver and sender. And for the user, it looks similar."

So the interface looks, same. Yeah. It doesn't change between the, receiving side also. Well, but the receiver is basically receiving a stream of bytes yes. So now, the receiver is gonna be even aware that receiver applications that there is a gap between whatever it received last from the socket and from the stream and, like, new data that's coming in that, like, supposedly at a very different offset. Far as the sender is concerned, Yes. Correct. A a receiver at the TCP receiver side, he he advised that there is a change in the sequence number. But the user of the TCP receiver. Like, application of the TCP receiver. He he doesn't avail there is a sequence number change. Because, the sequence number is handled up to the TCP layer. The whatever is sent, to the receiver is after the sequence number. Okay. Just wanna make sure it's usable. Okay. Thank you. Hi, Bob Brisco. Gotta think a bit more about there's any other way to do this, but, just as a picky point about utilizing a TCP flag for this. I think it'd be worth looking at other flags that wouldn't be would would be compatible with this and putting them putting it together with them to make a code point instead of"

And then you've got more code points rather than burning a whole flag Before doing this, I mean, that's an optimization. Before doing this, I think we should understand whether this makes whether this is useful. I started out saying, I'm, you know, have to think about whether this is useful, but if if it was, Okay. Yeah. When you're in that off time, thank you for the presentation. I think we should continue discussing this on the list and Anything else? Sorry, Matt for cutting off. Yeah. No. Need to think about this more as I'm not sure about how to use this practice, but I think that's it. Yeah. So then we are closing the session and Steven Pressbank. This this unless it's protecting against exactly that. Yeah. No. I mean, you can use you can use detail as for detail as a word. Of That's the worst thing. Yeah. This is channel still open. Hi, Matt.
