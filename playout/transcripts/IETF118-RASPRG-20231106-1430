We are open to all kind of works in this space. The type of outputs includes, joint reports, papers and tool data and open source software. Actually, we have how some of those talking about, today. What Rasp is not about. This is about making hierarchical assessings between standard development organizations. The point of Rasp is not to say the IDF is great. And they will basically see is not or anything of the sort. Directly influence IETF operations. Though, of course, people are very welcome to take whatever findings they say here and interpret them in whichever way they find appropriate."

What we're looking to do is essentially support, senders participants, in identifying center proposals that, could potentially challenge, interoperability on the internet or that, you know, sort of propose, you know, to sort of transform how we do addressing naming, networking and and routing on, the Internet. So why tracking Internet standards? So our sense was that, internet standards development is a bit, you know, in you could say that, you know, people talk, you know, point in time in that know, we're seeing lots of conversations about, sort of ways to evolve the internet to sort of adjusted or adapted to the needs of future networks, if technologies. And we find that, you know, those conversations, those discussions, merits active engagement from the community. And, you know, we wanted to sort of innovate in ways of facilitating that engagement in that conversation. There's also sort of situation or engagement standards, which is, you know, how time and resource intensiveness to engage in SEOs. I think, you know, any of us you know, you know, preparing for an IT app would know, empathize with with that sort of, you know, feeling of, you know, how health much time you actually had to sort of invest to to be able to participate in the spaces.

Last word on the standards of certory, I already mentioned our funders, I silk, on-site, and in of what we offer, we have the sender's tracker, which is a bit sort of the, the heart beauty of the Internet surgery and, the tool that I'll be showing you in just one second. Just to sort of caveat the work that we do with the tracker, our focus on standards that are currently under development. Don't focus on standards that have been approved in their degree of sort of adoption or deployment. And our SEO is a focus our IIT, which is the standard standard station arm of, the on telecommunications union. That's the tracker that ready that's available on our side and the one that I'll be showing you today. We are in the process of developing the tracker for IETF that in the works and hopefully we'll be sharing that, you know, possibly in this group at a later point in time and will also be, producing a tracker for Etsy, which stands for European Telecommunication Standards Institute.

But now on to the, you know, what we really want to show you, which is the standard tracker so we actually thought of doing a a demo, a live demo for this presentation, but we weren't sure whether that was within the rules. So we've gone for, screenshots, but this is we, available on our, website on the DNSRF website. And I will ask my colleague Nathan to, you know, share that in the chats. So that you can access it. So, essentially, what you what you see here is sour tracker. As I mentioned, we have it available for ITT at the moment. And at the top of the screen is, the study groups that we are tracking. We're tracking study group 13 or future networks, study groups 16, on multimedia and digital Technologies, which is the study group where we saw some of the sort of work, early work of metaverse emerge, at ITU and also study 17, which is a one on security. I will also sort of flag. We we started doing, the tracking in, the first quarter of 2023. So for instance, for study group, which is the one that's selected now, you can actually look at contributions or standards proposals for the March and October meetings. In terms of what information we right, you know, we we provide sort of, a brief sort of overview about what the standard proposals are about. So here you can see you have the title. Yeah, you know, what meeting the the standard, you know, corresponds to the number of the contribution so you can we go and pull the document.

You can do that, on, on sort of the left hand, column of of the tracker. And I will say, because I forgot to say, and this is actually really important. We also do color coding 4 hour, proposals that we highlight as I mentioned, you know, we want to sort of help people figure out which proposals to prioritize when they're preparing for meetings. So you'll see that we basically call a code pro proposals on, red for those we think are important for, you know, people to engage with. Yellow for those that we suggest people should, you know, monitor potentially engage with well. And then we have in green proposals that are flagged for for tracking. This is what the tracker looks like. I've shown you the front end. So now I invite my colleague, Nathan to speak about the back end of the sender tracker. Thanks, Carolina. So this is the the dashboard for one of the outputs that we provide through our analytics platform.

If you go to the next slide, Calina, Once the documents are in the system, what the system does is it strax all of the individual words and phrases, from all of the documents. We're then able to, in the system, tell the system exactly what we're looking for within those documents. So there may be a particular theme or particular keywords that you're interested in in looking for within those documents. And we can do that through, creating what we call, custom datasets. Next slide, Carolina. And this is an example of of 1 of the datasets that we've added and some of the, the keywords that are of particular interest, at at this moment in time. Next slide. System also allows you to create your own scoring system. So you might want to, weight certain keywords higher than others, and you have complete flexibility in this within the system. To give precedent over certain appearances of different types of keywords. Next slide. This is the raw output. One of the raw outputs. So you can see on the left hand side are all the the document file names, the different sections, and the phrase and the phrase link, that has been extracted from that particular document. And what this here provides is a way for you to filter the data. For you to join in other datasets, and for you to form some different formulae and calculations on that. Next slide.

Once you have filtered down your data set, you've joined in your data, you can produce on the system, on the platform itself, a visualization of that data.

On the your first screenshot, you showed an example where you had the you know, directive, engage. I just wanted to understand what this means. Can you explain to me? Yeah. Absolutely. That's a great question. So think, you know, the the proposals, We do that. The color coding using the scoring system that my colleague Nathan sort of showed at the back end of the form. And basically, the proposals that score highly in terms of, you know, having a, you know, a high number of you know, keywords appear, you know, words that appear with high levels of frequencies are the one that's you know, the ones that score higher in our system. We understand that proposals her, you know, certain topics that, you know, we've identified are you know, align with, you know, introducing again new forms of doing naming or addressing online.

So how do you make sure that you Yeah. Absolutely. No. That's another great point. So we did this, analysis of proponents in ITU study group 13, in their sort of July meeting of last year. And roughly 95% of proponents are Chinese or Korean. So I think that bias has to do with just the you know, the fact that, they happen to be very prolific in this specific study group that we were showing we are confident that when we expand the tracker to IETF, we're going to see a much more sort of varied, set of proponents in the standards that sort of get picked up throughout our tracker, and I think that will ease, you know, that that concern about of the the political aspect.

The follow-up may be since you chose the, study groups in IT UT, we know that, some of the music plays more in, like, council working groups would they also be would it be possible to to add that to the tracker, but maybe response to the first question first. Absolutely. So in the council of groups, we we don't track those, but we could. The, you know, the moment is a question of sort of scoping the work, and we started with regroup to sort of post mall. But we can sort of grow from there. And in terms of access to documents with IT UT, you to be able to access a full contribution.

Like, I would be concerned if, like, a draft that was in my research group said, you know, engage, but, like, it was further along in the publication process. Then engagement would be helpful for. So, you know, like, you might you just might consider not letting the numbers dictate what a years. And I, I would also say maybe it's something that can help you all or others triage engagement, but that ultimately, if you could get working group or research group shares. To say, I love it if you advertise this draft. Because the people that come to your tracker are people that I want to review this work. At the right time, and with the right guidelines, that would actually be deeper engagement than I think just a sort of, like, computer says read this might give you.

And it's probably in a little different field it comes from the genre of, social social studies, So let me start in the debt topic is consensus decision making. You know, the IETF, we agree on standards by consensus. This was a 3 phase mixed mode study. I'll go into it, but the data is substantial. And this is public leadership. So here's the mission of the ISG. Hopefully, all of you know that anybody need to go over it as far as that and the way drafts are created? I'm if you need to, please let me know. The important thing is what do you all look looking at versus RFC 2026, which describes the IETF process. You've looked at maleness research. I can't tell you how as a personal working group chair of a chair of a working group that's existed for 30 or 40 years, how excited I am about that or to get feedback on reviewers' choices or to see some of the standardization. There's just lots of benefits. As you go through the process, to hand off. You start with an individual draft. You go to work in group adoption. You go through all the working group discussion you've talked about You finally get it finished. And then you get to the ISU approval stage. This stage can take from Believe it or not, Weeks, 2 years. Case you I've tracked some that are 3 to 4 years long. So you probably wanna look at the back end of it and what causes that. In that, what I looked at is the process of ISG review. The resolution of comments,"

But I'm dealing with chair 7, which is back down at Yari. And before then. So what's the big news? The big news is the time that it takes to get through the ISG depends on many decisions they make. The more decisions they make on drafts that come out with the results. The better they are. There has been variances between 50% of their decisions result in some action actually occurring. A draft becoming an RC, a working group forming, or perhaps administrative, like setting things for naming and addressing. The ISG has to do all of these. So you're draft works on it. This is a graph of the differences between the agents. Notice at the bottom, you see that some ISGs range at 50% some range at a 100%. And so, the next question on results, by the way, you cannot get that result from the RFC Publishing, There is no way to re record how many decisions they make, how much how many pres what's the pres percentage of results It's hidden.

The first thing I picked up in this study was to look at collaboration We talk about collaboration. Is it the thing? that if there's collaboration at the IETF, that you'll predict it. No. I could not get a one on one given the classical definition of collaboration, I'll show that next. I went to solidarity, which says A simple definition for solidarity for the layman is where are you gonna put your extra effort at? If when there's a problem you dig in a little deeper and you make the thing succeed, that's solidarity. Sounds like perhaps the Polish a solidarity movement. But that's there's a classical definition and leadership on that. That was researched by people in the Netherlands. And then I looked at how conflict actually works with it. Solidarity proved it just in case you want me to tell you the end results that that's, year on year a good predictor. Conflict is extremely complex in this environment because it's open. Because it's open and we value collaboration Conflict is there. Sometimes it's above ground, sometimes it's below ground. Here are the definitions Okay. In order to enable myself, to, answer questions. I'm going to let you read those definitions Those are the ones that are approved.

And the very places it is in the data tracker are legendary. So I first went through a lot of historical data and collecting it is very difficult. And again, at future time, I'll do that. I also the ISG in two different times. So I collaborated it and then there's a matrix of triangulization. Probably the triangulization you're most and lift that comes at this level of cell phone triangulation. And I modeled some of it after it. Okay. And then or the reliability, if you're used to combat analysis 90% is really good, and most of the stuff went to 85 anything below 80 is non acceptable. So and the self reported effectiveness, one of the other key takeaways. Is There was a perfect model match when you did the RFC. So the the IST when the survey they really thought the RFCs represented at least it appeared that. I don't know. Didn't do interviews on that. Again, correlations, if you're interested on correlation reports in the, multivariate statistics HR and starts for hierarchical regression models.

He used to say, we really see an uptick in the benefit of the ISG when we go away and we have a retreat Please don't cut that funding.

Then there's, all these working groups are collected into areas probably will notice, but I'm just going to go over it. And then then this area directors who direct those areas. So there's these three layers want to look at how this hierarchical structure affects the communication patterns in the ITS. So that is my key question that I'm putting at the top of the slide. How does hierarchy affect communication patterns? And the key concepts that I need to address go into the methodology of how I do this, first of all, the degree of a node, degree of a person, is how active that individual is in the in the mailing list. So a number of connections that person has in a particular year or something. Is no degree. There's the average neighbor degree. Which is, the degree of a person's neighbor. So a neighbor someone that someone has talked to, someone has connection with, and then you average those degrees and that's the Afish in every degree. And then a time window is a collection of all the activity within a certain time windows, certain time frame. So maybe a year a month or something like that. I'm using a year in this presentation. So that's just, some key concepts. I use, degree and average neighbor degree. And call it together through diff 2 different time windows. To, calculate some, interesting correlations. The first correlation I'm interested in we call, I call philanthropy. Which is the correlating the individual degree of a person. So the number of connections that a person has with that person's neighborhood's average degree in the future. A positive correlation of this would be an active person. So if someone has lost connections, their neighborhood gain has lost connections in the future, so they kind of help the neighborhood, Communicate in in the IETF. Or kind of opposite of that is an inactive person"

So their neighbors don't want to talk if you're active. I thought this is active and an inactive individual the neighborhood thrives. So people like to talk when that person doesn't talk kind of thing. Another correlation is kind of the opposite of that. Is looking at how the neighbors affect the individual. So, if you have a high and average neighbor degree, and time went to 1. Then your degree in the future. Will be Hi, I guess. So the way you think about this is if you have, if you're in a negative neighborhood, then you want to talk more in in active neighborhoods, then you don't want to talk more. That's the positive correlation. And then obviously negative is the opposite of that. And now let's look at some plots. So this plot is Both of these parts are top 1 is philanthropy, the bottom one is community, we're looking at blue as the regular participants line, and orange is the working group chair line. And we see that there is an increased effect for both philanthropy and community for Wharton Group Chaz. That suggests that if people talk to the working group chair, if, yeah, if if the neighbors are working with Jess, so, like, the working group talks to it, the working Jada's community. Then they will talk more And if the welcome group chair talks a lot, then the neighbors, will talk more. So it's like kind of a facilitation of discussion in within a working that's what we So there's, more of a effect of philanthropy community for working group chairs, especially for community So that's the first thing we saw working with chairs that they give facilitators. We think so. That's their fact that, positively by neighbors activity and the neighbors affect them positively. But don't look at the communication direction in that particular instance.

On the left, we have the outward star motif, where one node, the blue node talks to 2 other nodes, with 3 outward hedges. So they talked to people. But I've given some sort of, ways to understand this, at the bottom. It's kind of announcements or disseminate dissemination of information. So they kind of talk out to people. There's in wood stars. To know to talk to one person, would be kind of for maybe questions to that one person or condensing of information. So people talk to someone, then there's mixed stars, which is a kind of combination of in wood and at wood. And that's more of like discussion or facilitation as we looked at before in the previous slides. And there's some plots of these. At the top is the outward star. That's to, discuss the announcements we see that all three levels of hierarchy that Blue is record participants, the oranges, working group chairs, and the Greens Area directors. All three of them have a kind of similar level. Of outward star. So outwards like, announcements or talking to other people outwardly. But the two bottom plots, there's a higher, proportion of inboard stars and mixed stars for the high levels of the hierarchy. So both working group chairs and error directors get more, inward communication, and they they have more kind of facilitation or discussion with other people. This would suggest that the regular participants like to talk to. The higher levels of the hierarchy and They, I don't know if we still take discussion. And and That's what we see in the plots so we can see. People talk upwards, and they like to have a discussion. That's kind of my whole conclusion is the work group chairs do facilitate discussion of working groups, which is what you want. So for working group chairs,"

It would really interesting to see how, adding in things like the AESG mailing list and private conversations affected it. That data is not available. But would be fascinating. I agree. We might submit a request for the ISD for snooping on the participants. Mark, Yeah. I was wondering in relation to the patterns for a working group chair and area directors, Did you distinguish between kind of within their area of of leadership. As opposed to kind of cross area, communication, with any of these patterns. No. We didn't. There was just cross the whole IETF that is something, again, that we want to look into in the future. Yeah. And I feel like you could look at, like, pretty simply at the, like, the list for the working groups and and control. Yeah. We need to see if you're more active in your own working group. Yeah.

Because I may lose my train of thought. My name's Nick Merrill. I'm from the UC Berkeley Center for Long cybersecurity. And this talk is called Sediens And States. So, you know, look, this is not gonna be news to this crowd, But as a percentage of internet traffic, Mostly the tier 1 ISPs are not so relevant anyway. Mostly. Most people do ignore me stuff online. Don't really leave their ISP. They don't really leave their home AS. Request goes to the ISP and then it goes to, an off net or an edge cache. We call it cash or cash. An edge cash that, you know, is is at that ISP. You know, if you look at the numbers publicly and you add them up, just back with the envelope more than 50% of all traffic on the internet is served by these off So most internet traffic comes from these off nets to abuse a a Wu Tang Clan quote, you know, cash flows everything around me."

And I wrote a law review piece with my collaborator at Berkeley Law to just neurgidia, where we kind of dispel this notion of the competitive internet core, you know, that the internet core doesn't really look the way that people think it does anymore. Relates these content distribution networks or CDNs. That deliver the internet as most people experience Now the question becomes, how do states think about CDS? There's curiously little research on this. And that doesn't mean that nobody knows it. I'm sure that there are plenty of people in the state department who have plenty of thoughts about this, but none of them have talked to me. Okay? There are probably plenty of people in Google's policy team that have thought of this, but same problem. So when you do a literature search on this, There isn't really that much information. About how states think about CDNs or vice versa. And, you know, just as way of background here, there's this great piece by Frederick Douzet that totally changed the way I think about the internet true out in 2014. And she claimed basically the internet is both the cause and effect of geopolitics. So it won't be surprised to anyone in this room that the internet is the effect of geopolitics. Okay. You rule a country, you're a dictator, people are saying stuff you don't like because you have some political goal you're gonna censor that information. You're gonna censor that, kind of traffic online. And that is, of course, the effect of geopolitics. Right? But if you accept this, then it's a short leap to, go on and say, well, of course, that is also the cause of geopolitics. Now imagine all of those people for whom the internet is censored. They don't know about certain things that are online, so maybe they behave differently, or they seem to become more docile, you go. The internet structure has gone on affected geopolitics. So this 2 way relationship plays out in a variety of for domains that are of historical interest to itfirtf you know, China with routing, China has this great bottleneck a lot to read about"

That makes foreign websites ever so slightly slower than domestic websites such as exacerbates. Preference for for domestic websites. Similarly, Iran has this, a selective kind of international censorship regime lies on a mix of BGP and DNS is quite sophisticated. You can follow-up. Of course, all of these are, like, through, in the slides. And similarly, you know, there's this great paper that came out in 2021 about Eastern Ukraine's routing dependency on Russian. And the office at that time, Lumiere and colleagues that, you know, hey, this is gonna be a problem. There's every military action. Eastern Ukraine, it's gonna make it a lot easier to deny internet access in that region that came out in 2021, the rest is history. Right? So we know a lot about this 2 way relationship. And by the way, I I put these studies up there because they're great studies and also illustrates that this 2 way relationship cause and effect. This is not philosophy. Okay. This helps us think about practical issues that, that, you know, are kind of everyday, political importance. So we, we think about you know, BGP, we think about DNS, but how does CDN spit it this geopolitical picture. This is not super well understood. So narrowing this question somewhat, You know, there are 2 kind of questions on my mind that I think help frame. How do states want the internet to be? And why do they want it to be that way? How does CDNs want the internet to be? And why do they want it to be that you're, again, you're probably me asking which states all of the states And which CD yet? So every CDN or recounting the commercial CDNs like Akamai, and, you know, the so called Hypergiants that are vertically integrated based the, you know, content houses, plus content delivery systems with off nets, k? These are all good questions. We'll get to them in a second. I'm illustrating here is more a way of framing the question I'm trying to ask here. So how the states want the internet to be? We actually know a good amount about that all. There's a great, a lot of really great work about, internet sovereignty and and how states, you know, policymakers about the internet as a realm for sovereignty"

You you've established to me that that, CDNs are are, you know, kind of important to the internet and we don't know about it, but but why really care about So this is, what everything that happens when a user visits a web page. Okay. Don't read this. Point is that it's too complicated to understand, okay? But this is, this was included in this great paper by David Clark in 2012 control point analysis. And, you know, Clark's point in this, paper that although this is very complicated, there are a few key control points that that kind of govern the way that the internet works, maybe for everybody. So some prior work I did, with the internet society, for their pulse dashboard, it was looking kind of jurisdiction of some of these key control points came up in Mark McFad who's, talk earlier today. You know, the, There are a lot of different control points that run by a handful of companies, maybe handful, maybe a large handful depends on your perspective, but whatever the handful is, there is exactly one jurisdiction, that that, is behind most of the corporations here, and it's the United States. So one thing I conclude from looking at chart, you know, proxy services, by the way, that includes CDS. So proxy services, CDNs interchangeable for our purposes. These in CDNs, they may not work exactly the way that the US federal government wants them to work the US spread all the government consents to the way that they work. Okay. There's no huge problem here that is a deal breaker and is making the US federal government come to CDS and say, hey, this out. You're gonna have to do something totally different from what you're doing in the US government. Consenting to way that the the, CDNs are delivering the internet. To least that's that's my conclusion. But, that might not be true for Allstate. So who in this room is a brief show of hands knows about stops net or remember stocks. An overwhelming majority. Okay.

There was this, very sophisticated multi step kind of offensive operation against the Iranian nuclear program at the time. And, it required the whole lot of of really neat kind of offense capability. But the point is, you know, the point 9 takeaway from it, if you're a state, you haven't really needed offensive cyber capability, could take down something even that's pretty well protected. Air gaps and all the other things. So the question on my mind here is Is it ever possible that a state would be motivated to do a stock's net level of on a CDN. And you may immediately think state would never do that. If you took down and just erupted a CDN, state would suffer too much because we all rely on the city. Else. I'm here states whose internet sovereignty programs are sophisticated enough, that they don't actually require, they don't actually rely on CDNs as much the rest of the internet does. And, you know, make of that what you will, but what I make of it certainly is that the cost for disrupting CDNs if if you are in a country that has this kind of sovereignty regime. Is much lower for you than it would be for anyone else. And so, you know, CDNs, they serve a lot of content, not everyone likes the content that serve. And on top of that, we all rely on them, a lot So if your goal is to deny internet access, then disrupting a CEM is is not a bad way to go about it. And, we all have seen, I think, in recent, the recent 2 years in in this year that, denying internet access has been incredibly, indispensable part of the arsenal during, you know, combat and and military operations. So, you know, I think that we should always be concerned about, new ways to deny internet service. So what states? I was, you know, said, how does states think about it? Which states I think we're probably most concerned with states that maybe don't consent to the ways CDNs work, especially, states that have lower reliance on CDNs, and they have Yes. Okay.

Does CDMs want the Internet to be? If we understood a little bit more about how CDNs wanted the internet to be, we'd be able put that up against the best available information about how states want you'd say, okay. Where are their tensions here? Where are there, where is their room for collaboration and, and where am I tensions arise. So, fair might there be danger in those tensions? These are a few papers that I know about. They're couple other uncertainties, but to wrap up in the interest of time, I will stop here. And, move over to the to the queue, which I see is is growing. Bryan. Great question. Thanks a lot for the presentation. I have what might sound like a nitpick, but might actually have some insight behind it. Can you go back to the, the slide with the portions of, yeah, the big, the bar graph. So there's a really interesting thing here. I'm assuming that this is post luts encrypt. Yes. This is posted. So, like, 90 something percent of that 96% is what's incorrect with that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So one of these bars is, like, built on open structure and basically anybody who can figure out, you know, where to find a data center, which yes is, like, 60% over on the on this slide as well could, like, basically replace it as a choke point, right, an easily replaceable choke point in a way that data centers are a much more difficult to replace chokepoint. Right? Like, there's real estate involved and construction contracts, etcetera, etcetera. So I think it would be interesting as you go down this, this like this path of, like, analyzing the replaceability of the stuff under the depth tree of a data center, how much of it is facilitated by having an open protocol that actually you know, makes it you know, go find a cloud provider and stand it up and you're done in in 48 hours versus go find a bunch of backhoes and some land somewhere that nobody's using."

I I wanted to introduce a case that I don't think present in your problem statement, which is There are some places where it's neither the state nor CDNs that create this problem of like, like, Island. So, an example I can think of is Armenia, which is surrounded by Iran, turkey Azerbaijan. And you know, has essentially only a teeny, tiny percentage of its connection going out through Georgia. And is otherwise a completely free and democratic state that does not put any filters or sensor on its network. Nonetheless, It is under a heavily heavily censored internet because of its neighbors. So that's a case of the state would love its internet to be more open. But the CDNs are not serving that purpose, and there's no way to sort of. Well, well, I think unless we reframe it as maybe you're suggesting, there's no way to sort of break out of, like, How do we help? Places like Armenia. Another one we heard about this morning is, like, you know, that territory, a and b, in Palestine, like, no choice, right, but to to just take the internet that one is served, irrespective of, like, what the state wants. So anyway, just something to add to this a little bit. We're thinking about point. Thank you. Yeah. There's yeah. The again, you know, at this point, the brings up. This is so complicated. And CDN sit on top of, of course, you know, this is very infrastructure we heard about earlier in Palestine, you know, there's denial of all kinds of different internet One of them is the electromagnetic spectrum, the EM spectrum, the radio spectrum, that kind of denial is like this legal policy denial and like, oh god, you know, once you have that kind of, oh god, it's, you know, it's hard to even think about what do you on top of that?

Other thing is, I mean, CDNs also, kind of shield, shields of for, like, details attacks and, and those things. So, it's kind of difficult to say what we, be how to imagine that, bullishing CDN would make the internet, automatically more not talking about it. Like, I've never said. I think CDNs are great. I we all rely on them. They literally run the internet. My only question is, how do they conflict with the interest of states. Because if they do conflict with the interest of states, it is possible the state might have been toxicity and then I'll be horrible for Right? Then the other comment, So you mentioned, censorship, and, it's, of course, the problem But, also in connection with CDN, so sensitive happens on on multiple layers, right? So not only the connectivity layer, but, say, maybe even more impactfully, on the, say, information or application layer. So for example, social network microbolic looking platforms, and so on. So this affects CDN directly because, states may want to enforce certain censorship there. And, I'm not sure whether that's something to to look into. Yeah. Great. Thank you for the comment. Andrew. Hi. Andrew Capering, 4 19 Consulting. 2 thoughts. One is on the chart you you put up with the different sort of bars. Well, yeah, that one. Thank you for my very loose description of it. I guess an observation, of course, some of the CDNs at least operate across multiple bars. So actually, you could argue, the scope of activity in as much broader than that is not so"

Certainly by observation of some of them, it's very homogenous which makes them an extremely vulnerable to attack because if you crack hail that, architecture is, you know, their toast. But basically every node everywhere in the world is exactly the same. So there's absolutely no diversity I doubt you even need to craft them all. If you craft 1, you know, so many developer tools are hosted on that one that it, you know, craps is all the even if you go and you take up my down all the packages that that cloud player uses to build their endpoint tools that probably owes it on optimized, like, Yeah. And then final comment, if you look at the sort of policies loose sense of the word of some of the CDNs in their approach to things like the content that they tolerate. Compare and contrast that with the public policy some of the states. You might have a larger set of nation states that would be potential attackers because they've got a hugely divergent interest without drawing any value judgments as to who's right. That's a great point. Yeah. Thank you. Excellent points. And I appreciate your comment also about how, yeah, you know, like, Cloud player also manages your DNS and your point of presence, all that stuff. It's a great point. Just a quick comment, before Ramakrishna jumps in, in abusing my privilege as a chair. This plot is very interesting, but given the fact that the most of the users of the internet, belong to the west and in particular, to the US, it is probably biased to the fact that it represents, the demand. If you were to look at it in different countries, you might have a different picture in one direction or the other? Totally agree. Yeah. So that's a really good point.

Well, this is good. No. I mean, you, I'm I'm wondering what your definition of a based companies because I imagine many of these sedans are, you know, registered across multiple jurisdictions and obey, like, the local laws of many different places. Yeah. That's actually a great question. So this is I'm eager to dig more into, but basically, I had a sense check with the professor at Hoss, which is, like, UC Berkeley Business School about, like, corporate jurisdiction. So basically, there are a lot of things you can do with corporate jurisdiction or whatever. But there is this notion of, basically, if you are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Congress can haul you up in front of Congress. And that is just a really basic track that you can do. We we basically looked at a lot of these companies. Are you coming to, you know, the US when you're trying to find you know, liquidity when you're trying to trying to seek public capital, these public markets. And if you are, then you are you're whatever you say, whatever you're in an Ireland or a state of whatever. You know, no slight to you Ireland's tax policy, obviously, there's legal thing to do, but it was very commonly done. But, but you were not an Irish company by any If you're on the New York Stock Exchange, you're on the start. That makes sense. Also a follow-up question. Seem to be saying that the CDNs have a uniform goal across you know, different populations, but is it possible that you know, they have different services that they give to different sets of users. Yeah. Okay. Great. Now this is getting into stuff. So, yeah, they almost certainly have different goals from one another. And those goals probably split on a variety of ways. So long first way, obviously, I think that the Hypergiants who are vertically integrated. Like, Google probably have different goals from, you know, Akamai who really will just take a customer's data and and put it around. You know, and I also think that perhaps, you know, offline cloudflare may have different goals because they serve different market segments. I mean, that they have different niches in the market.
