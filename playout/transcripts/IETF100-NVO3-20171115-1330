    "text": "tell your surprise Thanks so my name is Tom Mizrahi I\u0027m from are well yes that so this draft is about IOM in Geneva as you can see there\u0027s a long list of authors led by friend partners so I guess most of you probably have seen the slide I\u0027m going to go over it pretty briefly in a nutshell IOM stands for in situ om and the idea is that okay so the idea is that IOM allows you to integrate Network telemetry information into in-flight packets into data packets and this avoids the need for control plane om messages and you can still measure the performance of the network accurately the base document of IOM has been accepted by the IEEE ppm working group so it\u0027s being discussed there and these are all questions until the end there\u0027s no way you already have a question that\u0027s why just I can hold it okay so the base document of IOM defines data fields basically these data fields include information which can be either included on a hop by hop basis or on an end to end basis and this information includes for example information like node IDs interface ID is timestamps and also other types and IOM is defined in a way that can fit different types of encapsulations so it can be encapsulated over ipv6 sr v6 and a sage and also Geneva this is the context of this graph okay so this is briefly this is what IOM over genève looks like so we\u0027re going to have obviously the Geneva header and then after that the IOM data is encapsulated in a Geneva tunnel option so we can see the Geneva tunnel option and then it\u0027s followed by the IOM header and then the IOM data obviously after that we have the payload and the idea is that in the Geneva tunnel option we have the option class in type would specify what kind of volume data resides after "

    "text": "that so now at this point we we come to the interesting part which is the open questions so I\u0027m going to mention the open issues that we\u0027d like to talk about here and then after that we\u0027ll open it for questions and discussion and obviously we want I owe em to be hardware friendly so some of these open issues there are two main open issues which are kind of related to the way IOM is implemented in hardware one open issue is about the tunnel option lane and today the way Geneva is defined is that you can define a Geneva tunnel option up to 128 bytes in length so the question we\u0027re asking here is given that we can certainly think of use cases where we\u0027ll need IOM information which is greater than 128 bytes would it be a good idea to allow Geneva tunnel options to be longer than 128 bytes that\u0027s one question to keep in mind another open issue is related to the way we encapsulate IOM data into the packet so there are two main approaches here and we raise the similar issue this week in SFC so we can see the the figure here will chose kind of two possible approaches the left one and the right one so let\u0027s say that we have three IOM options that we want to encapsulate in a packet so one way to do that on the right side is to have these three options all as part of the Geneva extensibility so we\u0027ll have three different Geneva tunnel options three tlvs okay that\u0027s the right option and the left option is to use a dedicated protocol type for IOM so that means that in the Geneva header the protocol type will say after this we have IOM and then in the IOM header we\u0027ll have a next protocol field which will specify that after that we have another IOM option they kind of like a linked list and obviously there are pros and cons here so some hardware implementations find it hard to parse tlvs so the right alternative may be difficult in some implementations and obviously there\u0027s also an advantage to the right alternative because the genève header includes an optional length field which actually tells you where at the end of all the options is so if you want to just skip the options you can do that okay so it\u0027s not a clear cut between the two options there are poison content with again we\u0027d like to hear opinions about that the current version of the draft describes the right alternative which uses Geneva options so at this "

    "text": "point first of all like I mentioned the IOM base document was accepted by the IPP and working group it\u0027s being discussed there and this week we\u0027re presenting different encapsulation specific drafts in different working groups so we\u0027re presenting here the IOM over Geneva and as you can see there are other grafts in other words and basically what we would like to ask right now is to receive feedback about whether the working group is interested in adopting this work about whether we\u0027re interested to work on this and of course specifically related to the open questions that we raised here so good time for questions okay let\u0027s begin so are you state that the benefit of IOM is that you use data to export telemetry information rather than use for example appendix G RPC kafka net continent if occations so is that the main advantage there are a few different ways of how to measure the network no the measurement because you you talk about telemetry telemetry is some information that is our state of the no physical resources like CPU utilization memory utilization buffer queues that\u0027s a telemetry that\u0027s not measured by the flow and usually this being exported out-of-band transport so you\u0027re suggesting to export this telemetry information using the wide traffic you state that this is advantage I would like to understand why this is advantage okay so I just want to emphasize I\u0027m not going to focus on the term telemetry this may be the wrong term okay but what we want to do here is to gather information about a path which includes static information like node IDs interface IDs in state information like time stamps and queue depth and so on okay what nodes on a tab and the or 3 layer you want to trace you have NV e and 2n you don\u0027t have NV in the middle so what are you tracing so well if we have iom data which is transported over genève encapsulation then intermediate nodes don\u0027t have to be genève nodes they don\u0027t have to be Geneva or notes but they don\u0027t touch genève encapsulation because they are usually IP nodes they don\u0027t look in genève encapsulation "
