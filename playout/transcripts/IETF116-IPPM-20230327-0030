Welcome to One sixteen those people in the room as well as oh, it's getting dark and mood lighting. As well as everyone who is remote. So we're gonna get started now. We do have a pretty full agenda So do you wanna the sites? Cool. Alright. So if you've been at a active meeting or you should be familiar with the note well. But if this is one of your first times please do take the time to read this and familiar familiarize herself with know well, this is the conditions under which you participate and contribute work within the. Wanna read in more detail, you can just use your favorite search engine and look up Etf well. So as a reminder, we do have a masking policy for the meetings here at"

Alright. So we have meetup a link for the people who are remote, you can clearly use Me echo go to join the queue, but for everyone else, who is even person, we are also using the mid lightweight wait client to do the queuing. And so please pull that up. And join the queue that way, as well as being in the my here. As far as sharing slides, we're able to share the preloaded slides here. But if you would like to drive them yourselves you can also do that by requesting the document sharing. I icon we can grant that. And we do have a link for the notes and the notepad, I have also put that in the chat So to that point, we will need a note taker for this session. To just help us take notes and generally that just consists of capturing the high level points and particularly when people come up to the mic and have discussions are there any decisions that we make as a group. Recording those in the notes. So Could we get a volunteer to help with notes this time? We're gonna need note take before we get the session started. So Alright. Any volunteers. We get someone to just sit in the notepad and help take notes here."

Alright. We can move on and we'll we'll monitor the chat. And be able to relay a thing. We need to. Okay. Okay. So as a overview for The agenda that we have today, we're first gonna start by going over all of the current working group documents. We do have quite a few that are in progress at various stages. We'll get an update on all of those and see which ones are have open questions and are ready to progress. And then after we get through those, we do have a set of lightning talks. These are just quick one slide proposals for new work So in order to get through all of those, we would ask that you're doing the lightning talks that we keep these to be relatively brief, so we can give time to everyone who requested the slot. Okay. And I think that is it for us. Actually, there's one other that we wanna highlight. That is gonna be interesting to people in this room. So later in the week, at the Ts area meeting, which is the meeting where we have sent the overview of the entire transport area of which Ip is one of the working groups Marcus, my could will be giving a talk"

So Please come out to that if you have a chance. that's on Tuesday session three. So And Please please come there. You have time. Alright. Okay. With that, let's get started. So I think up first, we're gonna talk about encrypted Pd two. Na, do you want to drive this remotely? Hello? Can you can you hear me? Yeah. No. Okay... Yeah. What... No. Why don't you guys drive And Nice me I can put my thing on. I look terrible. Sorry. Okay Yeah. So I got Covid. So to. We'll we'll be there to... Now, let me turn on my video kits terrible. That. So So let let's just go quickly through it and Tum will be there. To answer a lot of questions. So next slide please go see it kinda quick. Okay. So So so what we've them basically? Is we've done We we made it kind of a a modification that really simplifies things. So it let's there list take a checkpoint. These are the fields that we've got in Pd v two.

And that's packet sequence number last received or actually packet. It's it's package. What happens is that the receiver takes packet sequence number this packet. And sticks it into packet sequence number last received of his. If you didn't need decrypt that field, then there'd be no need for how any kind of key agreement between the sender and receiver whatsoever. And all you have to do is encrypt. Now, let me stop here and see if that makes sense to you guys of what I'm saying? Because that's critical. Yes. Okay. So no questions. Alright. Grand. Grand. Okay. So let's go forward. So what we're doing What this is kind of a... Is it a it's a it's a major simplification and restructure hearing. But I think this is really gonna make things you know, work for the long term. So we're we're proposing is we pass that Ps p the the packet sequence number of this packet in the clear and you don't ever need to re decrypt that for the other side because it's in clear and he just sticks that into his last received field. And he knows what it is because it's clear. And then that also becomes the knots that's needed for encryption. In the Ae d cipher suite that we're using, you need to have a knot and so why not just use Ps because that works out real well. And we've added just one little field and have an App field. You know, to for the rollover over and Tomas can"

You know, because, you know, clearly, you're sending this data, but you need to figure out what has happened and do the performance matching and see, you know, because really, the the the point of Pd is to say this much time was sent in the network this much time was sent in the server, and all that stuff can be done offline. It greatly reduces it greatly simplifies everything that is in you know, and the and the work of Pd. And also a lot of the stuff about a top of having a primary server primary client and all this carrying on, we had done that because of the key change mechanisms that were needed. Right? You only need to do key key exchange if you're ever going to decrypt if you're never gonna be decrypt, you don't actually need to know what the key is. And so as I say, it it hugely simplifies everything and it also creates a fast mechanism that I think we can we can implement. But we're going to talk it over with the group before going ahead, and making such a huge change because it it's really a large change. Is a change for the better. But it's a big change. So Yeah. What let's see what the next slide is. But but other than that, I think Yeah. That's that's what we've got. Is this is the the current layout. And then we've just changed of the new layout to to have the Ps in the clear and everything else is is encrypted. Yeah. Next slide. And mean that. Hey questions just... Yeah. What do you guys do you guys think?"

At global pointer, Plus and reserved are sent in the clear everything after global pointer. Is encrypted. But that's what's in. That's that... That is the the clear text. That would be there. But on the wire it's encrypted. Yeah. Right. So then so what we're looking at here is the layout before encryption and you essentially are rearranging things so you can expose the Ps p and have everything after global winter Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But as I say, the biggest say of this is that if you don't need to have key agreement, you know what I mean, if you don't need to do any kind... If you don't need to agree on the keys, I mean, as you as you can well imagine, it's a huge simplification of of everything. And I don't... And I think I I I don't think we need to agree on keys. It's also... It's... Because, you know, the only thing we were getting into is as we're gonna implement station. It was getting me a nightmare you know, just trying to... The complexity of the code was getting to be a nightmare too. Yeah. Understood. Great. So I mean, it sounds like we want feedback or input from the group here. Do people have more questions, reactions to this approach even just expressions of Yep. Understand this. This sounds reasonable, I don't know if you want to comment anymore."

So basically Yeah. I know you did you you the the nail on the head it was it was... Yeah. It... Because a lot of that that top apology business was so that, you know, yeah.

But you have retained the two authentication modes. One which handles the control package. And the other that handed it handles of the feedback status brackets. So we we can add that on separately. Because there is a processing cost And of course, we got the authenticated mode. So then added mode for protocol supported. Encryption of all control. And the status packets again, no packets. As so we call this partial encryption. And which terms of algorithm for that, so on and so forth. And we've got also got an option that we talk about for users and make measurements then an encrypted tunnel. And they get to choose that. And that's a fully encrypted operation. So it includes the plug package. And now all the rest of the baggage. So with that set of options, I think we've got good coverage for anything anybody put want. And So then since we publish the draft. We started to expand looking at what the protocol can do. And we're finding this to be a pretty capable protocol. So now I don't think our we're doing.

And what you can basically do with this new recommendation is that there are templates various applications output. Produce and laws. And are very interactive applications like e gaming.

And this this new recommendation takes the measurements from the package stream and calculates an interactivity factor So if we've we've basically shown that we can do this using our are.

The key comments that I've summarized here are brian basically saying that our choice of aes Jc m. With symmetrical key. Is not safe. And a suggested a Cp mode.

In in section five point one three one way. We didn't say every year network. Addresses. And the authentication documents digest. Frances good practice to do that, but we basically can't do it. That.

So we... This is a pretty major update we it quite a lot of changes. I've been very active on the gear where everything is happening these days. The major changes are in this draft are primarily well on first, we Did an entirely revised algorithm where we completely changed the way we are generating the load and also how we are measuring the responsiveness on june duration of the of the test. Secondly, we we changed the away or we added the wage discover through Dns, the availability of a service endpoint, that allows based on the host, you based on on on an organization you can now find out whether this organization is hosting a responsiveness measurement and one And finally, we also added the dot well Url the configuration files, so that it's easy once you have this host name that is the response this measurement endpoints So now you can easily Based on the host name, you know that you can then use the dot well known Url to fetch to configuration file.

And in the draft, we recommend that the end of all should be one second. So it means during of of the duration of the test, we are adding one low generating test. One generating connection per second. Then the stability detection What we do know is we we take the last four intervals, of course, is is also configurable what we choose the last four intervals. And of for the forty the detection of the capacity saturation. And we compute the standard and standard that deviation of the last four intervals and make sure it's within five percent of the moving average. That way we have it it and for us, it seems to be much more stable and much more easy to much more reliable to detect stability. And additionally, also one of the major changes is as we are generating load on the network. We first try to reach stability for the capacity which means we go as continue adding connections to the pool low generating connections. Until we reach this capacity stability. And then we start measuring for your responsiveness because it's only once you actually fully utilize the pipe of the network would actually be able to measure the buffer load on the network.

To computer responsiveness. Know next slide to visualize this a little bit more on how this is happening? Good. I just wanted to check. I I do see that Greg joined the queue craig you wanna clarifying question here. Please have a Thank you. It's easier when this time. So I understand. Closed ninety five percentile. Do you see a value of making the threshold hold of something which can be defined. For a different situation Yes. So it might be for example, ninety nine or even ninety nine eight. Point nine. So depending on the condition interest of operator. Yes. Absolutely. So in the draft, we try to be a little bit more clear there in sense that we now list out a different variables or parameters that one can tune when measuring responsiveness and the ninety fifth percentile that is definitely one of them as well. It is... From our experience, having a one second interval, using the last four intervals for the stability detection five percentile but the five percent for this standard deviation ended the ninety fifth center for the trim meter.

So I didn't I don't know. So I want to just visualize the algorithm a little bit just make clear again on how we are If you have these intervals here, shown here as the vertical lines where we continuously are adding connections. On the top graph, you see how the is continuously increasing over time until we the maximum capacity that's available on the path between the client and the server. At that point, when we read the maximum capacity then we have the buffer that starts to increase because now we start creating buffer load on the bottleneck link. And so again, this buffer globe also has a maximum In this example, we chose a fairly extreme example of sixty four megabytes move of buffalo load And Now as we keep on sat the link and continue to add connections even beyond reaching this the capacity maximum, we are actually now able to fully utilize the link and fully fill the buffer off the buffer load. Of off the bottleneck, and so we can fully measure now the responsiveness under working conditions. By continuing beyond just detecting capacity stability, but also a response of stability. Eventually, the responsiveness then flattens out and that's when we declare such saturation. And can then provide the file number. Next slide. So so much about the revised algorithm"

It's like In Ale presentation, we saw that his he's measuring capacity, but he has a method of measuring some kind of responsiveness in, then you're primarily measuring responsiveness in this here, but your measuring capacity I'm wondering if you guys need to discuss and maybe produce something on when and where when it makes sense to use which of these methods. Because we might be shipping documents trying to solve very similar problems at a kind of similar time here. So I think some this on this. I'm not sure if it should go into this but that document separate informational document, but I think it's something we should discuss. Yeah. So marcus, the answers is... Let me jump in here Crystal. The answer is really really simple. The proposal that Christ and his team have put together. Is basically all Dc based. And with the Ip layer capacity measurement. We're using udp data. Now in a lot met other networks today, Dc and udp. Get the same treatment. Sometimes they get different treatment. Are taking very different transport for our approaches. To measurement. So There's a real gap out there among the tools. That are widely available. Most of them use Tcp. That's why we're we're really pushing hard to get people to adopt our our Udp based methods as well."

And whether that's H p two of h to be three meaning quick is is is basically the same. We are not advocating that must be Hp should two So from our perspective, it's... We want to use the the protocols that Are used by the end user for their data transfers and that today is h gdp and while capacity measuring measurement at the at the Ip or Udp is very is a different point of view or different a different approach where it's more about maximum capacity Wifi, it's more about if for example, if those http flows end up using a congestion control that is very lens sensitive to loss. Then they made measure of very low capacity. Even if the real capacity is actually much higher. So It's it's my opinion goes up entirely different goals and different backgrounds.

Yeah the know what sign is as well. But here have the cumulative field. Would be excluded because it's going to be modify on the path. And if they absolutely node would check the meeting note why because Transit note would only modify the note. The community field, And as I mentioned, this field is excluded from the signature. Next slide. So the tricky part is about the trade transaction tide.

But I think it would be worse this is saying it maybe to have either protection because if you think about it, if you have that antibody protection of the data fields, but someone modi the names best id for instance, which she's a common field shared by all the Herbs type failures. Then the projections doesn't make sense anymore. Right? And So we could this just maybe having only the name based Id also included the signature or just have the headers. So I would propose this one for instance, if we consider as same rule, now we would have an am not only signs what it right, so something more generate. And now not that fills in more fields modified by other I notes. Are excluded from the signature. Next slide. So that would be the example of fields that would be included from the headers. So here for the tracer option some type, we would include the nearest Id, the node length. We could also include some flags. So the first one it's zero is the overflow flag, which doesn't make sense to include because it's it might be changed on the path. With one and two are four active and little back flags And I think that it's important to have them signed because you don't want to those flags to be changed on on the past. Right?

And that's something that we'll need to think about it. Because that is point that we might say that it will be any So basically, we'll make it a union value or any. But Yes. It's you'll see that I... In the last slide, I said might be we'll definitely need one at least one version. Thank you. Next."

But if session Sender is auto generating this stem session Id that operator system would not know it. So there is no really logical reason. To have it as a configuration parameter, a key in the list. So we are going back again to the parameters that our provision. Okay. Next slide, please. And now the fun part with the stamp session Id. So I already told you that for the sender it might be either explicitly provisioned or it could be auto generated. So that's we turn it into the union. So and our reflect test session again, could be provisioned that reflect is explicitly told you, okay. So this is for this session id because If you provision on a session, it might be useful in simplification, to do it similar for the reflect. Or say you you take any. And test session state, it's just number because it's known. It's report. It's redo only. Again, welcome your comments and thoughts about it. Next slide, please. So closing next steps, we believe that we address comments And we welcome more comments and I expect at least"

So I think it's time now to move on to our lightning talks. So I think First, we have the transit measurement option. This tall? Yep. Can you hear me? I'll go for it. Yep. We can hear you. Right. So this is a relatively new draft which introduces the transit measurement option On next slide, please. So to introduce a new Ip six option called the transit measurement and the idea is that an in node incorporates this option into Iv six packets and then transit notes along the path and updates the content of this option. Which records information about their performance and specifically there are two main fields here. One is called the accumulated delay field which updated by each transit no longer the path with its own transit delay so that at the end of the path, we have the sum of the transit delays. And the other important field is the map which is kind of a congestion state map. So each node updates its own bit in that bit map which which represents the Ec state So if according to Dc and State, the node congested or the queues is interested The bit is set, if it's not congested, if bit is not set. So This is a very short Ip six option, it has a fixed length and"

    "text": "even though it has a fixed length, it gives a pretty good picture of the congestion status along with path. So we believe that it's kind of complementary capability to hot by measurement, techniques like Io, So for example, if you use Io, it has a relatively long overhead, but if you use transit the transit measurement option more frequently It has a very low overhead that can be used for detecting a performance issue or congestion And then once you detect that congestion issue, you can trigger something like Io, which gives you much more fine grained measurement allows you to pinpoint exactly where the problem is and get more information about that. So this is a new option and relatively draft and we would welcome any comments any feedback about this? Alright. Thank you if you have comments questions, please bring to the list.

    "text": "Right. Hello, everyone. My name is Bj Ti. And the purpose of this draft is to point out as clearly as possible that different stakeholders have different needs from measurement tool and and the metrics associated with that? And then to list set of requirements that make it possible to address all of those needs simultaneously. So the three main properties that we've identified. Are capturing the information necessary to complete the probability of meeting network requirements. And metric should be comp to the point to discussion earlier about measuring at the end to end on the application layer versus measuring further down in in the protocol stack. If if your metrics are comp is possible to reason about which parts contribute what to the total sum? And then finally, be applicable in both test and monitoring for operators and applications and users. So if if a electrical or measurement framework can be used not only for sort of running a test at a specific time, but also for continuous monitor monitoring, then it we can address the wider set of needs. So if you read, go to Electro box, we want the the framework to be useful from from multiple perspectives. Okay. Thank you. And I'll also... Do prefer the next one. Okay. Here's the next slide."

    "text": "Yeah. I wasn't sure to include both slides in one or not. So Alright. Yeah. So this other graph is our attempt initial attempt at providing a framework to that meets all those requirements at the same time and this proposal It's a structure for network quality measurements and a structure for defining network requirements. And the main idea is this property of of defining what we mean by perfection where if network becomes better than that, it's better than perfect and we can be sure that the network is not the cause of any performance issues at the app layer and then another point which is sort of the point of useless where if the network is worse than that, then it's worse than useless and we don't care about much worse the useless it is. It's just this application has no chance of of working well over this network. And then the idea is to specify a range between these two points where sort of closer to perfection is better, obviously, but but that we can sort of quantify where we are on that spectrum between perfect and useless. So that's the main idea. The version of the metric and the framework that we've specified in the draft is based on the Q framework from the Forum? It's an initial attempt and we would really like to work with the community to to find the best solution for this problem. So appreciate any feedback or if you wanna work on this kind of problem. Please talk to me. Right."

Today, I'm going to give a quick recap of the Pv and this is the progress of it. So first, we give it technology classification for Pb. Use this figure you can see actually, for the on pass floating entry technologies, we have a family of existing technologies. I'm only on the passport mode technology has been standardized as Au trace option in our scene ninety one eighty seven. For the postcard based technologies, we have a two different options. Lines instruction based. We basically use the instruction header. That's why it's standardized as I dx direct support in C, that is three twenty six. So it clear shows that the marking based Pb described in this draft is a standalone in independent technologies. And it has a unique feature or properties that it's at near zero overhead. We just need a single bit worth of information to trigger till telemetry do collection. At each note on the peg class. So the data can be collected via another postcard packet to sent to the collector. So because of his simplicity it has seen a application in a different as in network scenario. For example, it's already adopted"

But because of this zero on year, zero or had feature It also introduced several unique challenges. Need to be solved. Let's the common ground need to be covered by this document. Once we have this document, then which means all the this this issues can be covered here and it can be shared by all the other documents which apply this technology. So they only need to specify where they will find this trigger trigger beat. Then all the other issues can be a final solution here. For example, on the right side, we we released actually five group of unique issues faced by this technology. We want to cover in this document. First one is for the past this Discovery. Because we need to to a react way to held a note on the past what data we want to collect. We don't want to for... I need to figure all the notes in that for So we we need to do that reactive.

So that's data support, method. And finally, are the important issue we want car a security considerations because like other Mode. This also has some security implications. We want to also cover in this document. So therefore this is actually a very important document I think is serve as a basis for the all the other that these solutions which can utilize this this technology.

Next, I think we're gonna talk about the dex timestamp. I so we have five minutes left, so may not get through everything. We gonna close right at eleven thirty.

On next slide please. And with the second draft by definition, I direct explorer uses a midfield to to say to the note, which metrics are exported. So that's why we also for consistency. Are adding requesting this bit to allow the export of the on building. The offers are aware that they they are already approaches to to compute this delay without this extensions. But what we are trying to do is already in the in the different notes with Ip fix I'm also cor this data. So that's why we are extending this approach. To do. So, yeah. We would like to request more feedback from the Ip working group through the main east for our mills, or maybe in person. We are here the whole week of the Idea So feel free to reach out and discuss with us why we just needed it and this is important. For us. So thanks. Thank you very much. Alright. I think.

You know that the alternate marketing methods are already published as as standard documents. But there are few pending points to explore, considering that there are in some or no additional beat that used also in some deployment, the entropy of the flow Id. Can be also consider it and in the end also the multi point measurement is something to take into account. This draft things to consider all this and general the data fields for all the transport protocols. So it seems to add some extended data to the base... Let's say, data field that is defined the c ninety three forty three, So the scope of this extension is to have shortest market periods to allow more dense delayed measurement to increase the entropy the flow monitoring identifier to automatically set up the backward direction and so on. So there are different extension that can be done. So we... I welcome more feedback from it Pm, also because this kind of extension is also this casting in spring in some way.
