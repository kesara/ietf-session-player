I uploaded new ones and they aren't there Is there any other, is there a working group chair here who remember? how to make me to go? believe in the new slides? Thank you uploaded new slides so it somehow is remembering old slides and not new ones I'm not going to worry about it if not I haven't seen that. Okay no, okay. Yeah, didn't do that okay okay okay okay pretend that you can see both of them them I think we're gonna to start. Can someone close the back door? Can someone sneeze? Both of them have happened. That's great So greetings This is the Pequip Working Group. I'm paul hoffman. Sophia is not on online, I don't think, or she's not being acknowledged She's not If you're new to the working group, there's we've got plenty of presentations today We'll go through the agenda in a moment. If you're familiar with the working group, the agenda is almost identical to the way it was in Brisbane. We've got updates but we're still sort of in the same state we were were so welcome turning on the phone"

That's fine Okay, now so the note well is already too small and now it's half size, so I really apologize for that Having said that, you all agreed to the note well when you registered, if there's anyone in the room who's not registered, you should be But the note well is sort of a historical thing in the IETF of things you're supposed to know It's not just supposed to know. You really, really, really are supposed to know this. Especially in a working group where there might be intellectual property things like that. If you, if you, if breezed over the note well when you registered, I highly propose that you go and read it like this evening at dinner or whatever. There is actually interesting stuff in it. It has evolved over time So now there is the new note or the note really well, which is it sort of for the old timers here, remember the Tao of the IETF was 30 pages, then it was 60 pages, and then it was a website, stuff like that. We're that way with the note well But this one is not about, you know, like legal responsibilities. This is about expectations. We are expected to treat each other well we're expected to disagree with each other cordially. We are excited to come from places of truth, not places of opinion if we can. Of course, we all have opinions but a really good practice when you hear somebody who is probably in the same intelligence quartile as you are disagreeing with something you think, is to shut up and think about it"

So next slide, please So for those of you who haven't seen this before, if it's your first meeting, we do have a draft here PQC for engineers. And what it expected is it basically explains why engineers need to be aware of and understand post quantum cryptography and then gets into a lot of the details that engineer care about and leaves out a lot of the details engineers don't care about. So it's a very IETF focused PQC primer intended to help people get up to speed on this very important topic as it becomes more and more"

And so if you've been following this, people love the term cryptographically relevant quantum computer in part because it looks like a different word but the cracks are what are actually going to cause the problem they're quantum computers that are actually large enough to break RSA and ECC. That's very different from the ones that exist today these aren't things that exist today but they will soon in a couple of years. And so we're going to sorry, we're a very different from the ones that exist today. These aren't things that exist today, but they will soon in a couple of years. And so we're going to insert whatever number you like for a couple And so, you know, there's a lot of debate over exactly when but it's more of a question of when, not if at this point And so PQC for Engineers was adopted by the working group following IETF 117 and there's been a lot of work on it since then Next slide And since, so since Brisbane, I unfortunately wasn't able to be here in Brisbane during the chair conflict but the work since then is based wasn't able to be here in Brisbane during the chair conflict, but the work since then is basically resolving all of the outstanding issues, which was basically changing all of the algorithm names to the NIST name like ML Chem and so on there were a couple of other typo fixes and things like that but that's about it. There really haven't been any major changes since EETF 119, nor has anybody really asked for any. So next slide we think we might be done and so we're suggesting that a good way of finding any room remaining work that needs to be done might be actually to have a working group last call after IE 120 and then we'll go through and see what we can get fixed out. And then hopefully it will actually be an rfc hope to have a working group last call after IETF 120 and then we'll go through and see what we can get fixed out and then hopefully it will actually be an RFC hopefully shortly after depending on the timelines shortly after the NIST algorithms themselves come out so it would be very useful timing if we get this out. If there are other things we want to draw algorithms themselves come out. So it would be very useful timing if we get this out. If there are other things we want to address later, we can always disit. I think that's kind of inevitable at this point, that over the next couple of years, there'll be stuff that comes up. But I don't think it's worthwhile massage this until it's perfect. I think the timing is kind of good now"

So you put your hand down to your drug document. Okay, so the people with your hand up if you can read it again or skim it again and note what you would have also liked to see so what to Tim's been asking for is Knits, and I think we are at the knit stage but if you all read it again and go, oh yeah, I really get this, but I didn't see a section on this, or I've been hearing about this and send that to the mailing list either now or during the working group last call Again, this working group's a little bit odd. We're not doing protocol We're explicitly prevented from doing protocols But this document's going to help a heck of all lot of other people, especially outside the IETF So having it be correct is one thing, but have it be full is also a really good one.

If you're familiar with this draft previously, you've been presented by Flo, so a brief interesting I'm Michael, I'm Flo's colleague and a co-author on this draft, so as Paul said, it's going to give a few updates on where we've got to with it And so for those, let's familiar, a little bit of background, this draft aims to standardised terminology for post-quantum traditional hybrids. The main idea is to make sure that when conversation is happening, there's no misunderstandings. People aren't using the same word for different things, or meaning different things and and getting confused and i think it's in quite a good place, and it's used a lot across, IETF and actually even wider in places like GSM. So I think we're doing quite well but really interested in your thoughts as well it was adopted following IETF in Japan and we did a working group last call in about February of this year, and as is often the way with working group last call we got loads of feedback and suggestions. So thank you for those And on the next slide, I've got some of those I should say this isn't an exhaustive list but here's just a few examples of some of the updates please do have a look at the diff If you're interested, I'll be around afterwards as well So firstly, we wanted to make sure it was clear what we were talking about with PQT hybrids and so in particular an example of one of the things that came up that wasn't quite in scope was things like using a chem and a pre-shed key for your solution and it's not quite what this draft is talking about, so he wants to be a bit more explicit about that Similarly,"

So we added some text there to make that a bit clearer. And thanks to all who who helped out making sure that we've got that consistent with other use cases Similarly, there was a, I think there was a comment on the mailing list about making sure we weren't overselling the security properties when using the term PQC made the decision not to change and not use PQC it's so widely used we want to have it in there, but adding a bit of a caveat to make sure people understood exactly what we meant and exactly what they were getting And finally, we removed some of the definitions on separability they were more suitable for the Signature Spectrums draft, which I think we're hearing about next. So we had a bit of redundant there and it wasn't needed you know this draft is very much kind of the base definitions that everyone's using. So the more specific ones fit better in that draft I guess as part of working group last call we had a few more conversations which may be fit in this draft and maybe don't interested in people's thoughts and so in Brisbane we had a suggestion I think it was for private key abuse, but more widely about antipatism or considerations that you need to take into account when using hybrids It's not currently in the draft We could add it to the draft, but I posted the mailing list and I think if there is another draft, maybe existing or maybe not, but looks into the security analysis more deep that might be a better place for those sorts of terms"

Again, that's not quite appropriate for this draft. It's just about the terminology. It's not trying to take a position that people might have different perspectives on. It's just trying to provide that kind of baseline to enable those conversations um so this is my last slide um i guess next is to decide what to do next um to enable those conversations. So this is my last slide. I guess next is to decide what to do next. As I said, the definitions are used pretty widely across IETF and i think that shows two things uh firstly that we said, the definitions are used pretty widely across IETF, and I think that shows two things. Firstly, that we've probably got that base set of definitions about right if they're being used consistently and people agreeing with them and finding the useful. So that's really good news. The other point is, as an author, I really hesitate to change those base definitions. I don't want to undermine it other people's work and so the other only other consideration is if there are other definitions to add, please do let me know I guess personal perspective is some of the suggestions recently I guess like the separability ones or like the anti-patterns ones might work better in other drafts and treat this one as just the baseline ones but keen on people's thoughts I'm not seeing anyone in the mic line I suspect we will do another working group last call because there were a fair number of changes Yep. Anyone here who is in one of the other working groups that is using this draft? Anyone with comments that you're I haven't seen, are there ones, are there people who are normatively pointing to this draft? I think not necessarily normatively Okay. John?

There's going to be new algorithms there's going to be probably new mechanisms that come up and the future having definitions for those are going to be needed. I don't think we should wait. You know, this document, I think we are using this terminology I think having it set in stone, right, and then we can have future documents I think that makes a lot of sense. Thanks And during the working group last call, we will also ask about the scope one where do we want to put these more these bigger ideas in, or in fact, do someone interested in doing what really would be a document about how to put these together, not the words of putting them together. I'm sorry with anti-patterns how not to put them together but operational considerations and such like that But we'll do that during working group last call as well Thank you. I don't see any more in the line. Thanks Okay, Girdre And you are you are this one. The other hybrid There you go. Cool As mentioned, this is hybrid signature spectrum with myself, Brita, Nina, and Flo Oops, why is this? not? There we go. Sometime before the meeting on the list, this was adopted This is a description of different security properties and spectrums of those properties in relation to how one can construct hybrid signatures using a post-quantum entry and traditional as component algorithms"

    "text": "Some of the properties that we care about in terms of signature that are not really present in chems are these notions of separability or non-separability So this is one of the high-level properties that we go through in this document from all the way to no non-separability. There's no evidence or artifact that there was supposed to be a hybrid signature composed of two-component algorithm that you're supposed to verify together no art artifacts exist that that was a case to all the way down to strong non-separability with simultaneous verification so that there's it's very clear that this is a hybrid signature and it cannot be verified in pieces any of the component algorithm cannot be verified independently of the other it's all one go so there's like one spectrum of separability There's also notions of generality and sort of when you have pre-approved software modules, say as like a fifth module, how can you combine them and kind of another spectrum to create these hybrid signatures? Sometimes you might have a construction that you can't reuse any of these things as a black box. You have to go down into the guts split it apart, put them back together again, and you get a lovely hybrid signature, but you can't reuse anything that you've already gotten approved before, or you have to dive into you know, an API boundary that you really would not like to all the way down to ways that you can combine them that's like you don't have to know about the innards at all, you can just like kind of plug them together That's another one And then artifact locations where in the signature or the use of the signature or in the key material or all of the above do you have indications or evidence of the high? hybridness and what kinds of component algorithms you have? in this hybrid signature?"

And then also more language about whether or not you want to do hybrid signatures at all, because for some people you don't care and some people you really, really do care, but we're not prescribing about whether you should adopt just language about you may or may not want to we're not assuming that hybrid signatures are strictly necessary in a general case. We're just describing a lot of these kind of spectrums of notions that apply to hybrid signature constructions so and this is the part where we think there's going to be most interest in the working group of like do the things that you doing in your other working groups is it matching this? Have we tilted too far and such? like that so consensus on this might be hard but this is a super important part So please reread the updated adoption draft. We, if there is be hard, but this is a super important part. Yeah. So please reread the updated, adopted draft. We, if there isn't a lot of, you know, dispute or dissent, we don't know if there's anything else that the working group wants from it If you like it, maybe we try a last call and that would actually suss out anything that anyone actually cares about. Yep And I forget you have other slides Yeah, that's just links right so we have not included any concrete construct of these things. We've kind of hand waved and included links to other work as references of ways one can approach it People have expressed interest, at least seeing what a strong non-separable fused hybrid, which is one of the ways you can construct one that we lay out in the document"

They are, they've just concluded a hybrid chem design team to get specs out for a, a about to start, I think hybrid cam document that will law out very specific concrete cam like very specific parameter sets in designs If there is interest in concrete hybrid signature designs, I think something like that process would be probably better or that probably would work out pretty well but I don't think we're there yet. I think everyone is paying more attention to store now, decrypt later attacks and so they're migrating to hybrid cams or post-quantam cams now, and they're waiting a little bit to deal with post-quandum secure signatures and so I think we have some time. But if you people are interested in concrete hybrid signatures, I think that may be the way it will move forward in IETF not necessarily kind of piggybacking off of this document in this working group So would you say that if that work was being done, that should be done in CFRG or here? I think. Have they done enough? legwork for hybrid chems? for us to do it here, or should this still be a CFR? work item? I would lean towards CFRG. Okay Yeah thought they were quite different but I just so I'm just sort of kind of underlying that, that like, we aren't expecting to like start sketching up.

Yeah, that's just what I said. Let's go back on this one and the Q line is britta hale told me to skip Okay, fine Yeah, just a question. I want to, and I'm sorry, I'm just behind the ball on this. I want to understand what the use cases are for fuse hybrids, like why people want to do this. Okay. Fused is like kind of the strongest, strong, non-separable kind of construction that we do lay out. And it's basically if you don't care so much about like, ah, I've got RSA over here, or I've got, you know, um, let's just say ECDSA over here. And I've got MLDSA over here. And I want to like, swap them or have options of doing one and smooth them together with another one because I don't want to generate two signatures If you don't care about that and you just want to be like, this is my, you know, reactor named MLDSA, ECDSA fuse signature, it will be one signature API type. It'll have a key that is only one type. You can't split it up. You have a signature You can't verify one part and split off the other and just pretend. It all very, that's, you love strong verification. That's, that's a little bit stronger but you can get that um Strong non-separability really gives you just sort of like the way that x-wing is just all in one these fused non-separate strong non-separate constructions are very much like that. It is like all bundled up one signature, one hybrid signature that may be a little bit annoying if you're a builder, but it's very nice and wrapped up in one little box if you're just a cryptographer. And you don't care about code deep duke little bit annoying if you're a builder but it's very nice and wrapped up in one little box if you're just a cryptographer and you don't care about code duplication you don't care about this other stuff you just have one owing for it. So I guess, is it, is it a, like? just a cryptographer and you don't care about code duplication you don't care about this other stuff you just have one oh in for it so i guess is it is it is it a like i what's the difference like is there an attack that's prevented by a strong, non-separable security?"

    "text": "scheme, like, versus, like, what the next tier down is what is like the attack that this stronger thing stops? Go ahead. By the way, when you come Great question. When you come to the mic, please say who you are so remote people. Yes, so britta hale so that is a great question so what you get all strong nonsense non-separability is essentially your classic signature performance which is a little bit different than if you have any other version of hybrid. So assuming you were doing a hybrid any other version, if you do parallel, concatenated, etc you can put it in policy, you can put it where it's audible in retrospect of whether or not you could have had an attack where someone did basically signature stripping what you get a few hardy fruits is basically a simple signature approach. It either verifies or it fails. If it fails, then you had an attack on one of the two composite components. So this is really the most one-to-one matching to a traditional signature that you can get out of a true hybrid The one other aspect of use case a consideration for fused hybrids is that there is a sort of forward compatibility benefit from it, that this is a single algorithm and if you do want to do a hybrid then you don't need to change your policy your product or anything else. It is a single cipher suite And if at any point in time, you need to roll that to a post-quantam only or which else, it is a simple replacement. Yep So it's actually a probably a very clean version. Now, there's probably overhead costs depending on what sort of system you implemented on so there's trade-offs and that's why it's being raised here among this group. I agree I notice the chat. This is not the CFRG, and we're not proposing it here This is a question for this group of engineers and users to say, is there interest in this? as a possible use that we would push this? in forward into the CFRG, etc?

Michael? interesting work. I definitely understand the motivation for it. It feels a little more CFRG you know, specific than here just for a variety of reasons. Whenever we start merging things together, that might have unknown properties, I know in theory this should all be fine, right? But just that there's aspects of this make, that make me just give me some pause and nervousness, right? Especially because we're saying, yep we're gonna go hide this complexity and it should be fine, you could just treat it the same way as everything else. I've seen those promises before and then I've seen them get deployed in different systems and things like that and then cause problems. So that's why just have some pause. Great Scott, you had put yourself in the queue, took out, okay, fine So do you think we should be? asking the question of, is there interest in discussion? this draft, or is that a separable? question? I think it's a separate question Okay. We're seeking input so that if we have enough input we could go to CFRG and be like, here's our draft of a few strong, non-separable construction. It uses you know P-56 and it uses MLDSA, and do you like this? but we'll go to CFRG with it Got it. And then here, for few do you like this, but we'll go to CFRG with it. Got it.

So the spectrum draft, which is more of a comparison terminology, which will kind of line, baseline on that before getting into this question, is it a working group last call? I think it's good to push it there if people have further things that tends to flush them out at that point. But we haven't seen anything and haven't heard it anything more. So that I would say this is a more of a separate question of getting lined up here but yeah. OK, very good. Thank you Anything else, John? Yeah, I was just going to say I'd be interesting in a strong non separable where you have two black boxes. I was talking to britta hale bit about this just before this meeting. I think it could be possible, but it would require a change to the signature API itself because it would have to return a piece of data that then would obviously go into the secondary signature. So I think that would be interesting to work to look at because I think with two black box right, like if you have something like Phipps or whatever one of them could be, maybe not. So I think there could be advantages for that So I think that would be definitely worth looking at and be at because I think with two black boxes, right? Like if you have something like FIPS or whatever one of them could be and maybe not. So I think there could be advantages for that. So I think that would be definitely worth looking at and I'd be happy to have discussions about that. Awesome thanks and those those even those are discussions that'll end up for the CFRGs those can have here if we see use case across the IETF for something like that like, you know, where what she said was known and known, and you're saying unknown and unknown If there are use cases to come up, this is a person appropriate list for it.

So we have produced more crypto standards and guidelines on and we continue doing today And in today, we are very happy to see that nearly a lot of big computing devices like laptops we have today they all have a crypto and quite often have FAPS validated or using NIST crypto algorithms or functions in them. Next slide And right now, we're here today to talk about post-quantum cryptography and how to deal with the quantum computers in the future and what that would do to what we are having today with the cyberspace and all the e-com and all the advanced technology that we're having today enjoying today. They very much got it from cryptography.

And then where all the data about performance and additional properties that the candidates or the algorithms have and based on that, we would make decisions moving forward and how how to go from there and it's more like we relax or not relax but we changed the direction how to how to both quantum processes different from, you know, how we did with Shard 3 three and a yes we allowed ourselves to have reserved a little flexibility to improve"

And one important thing So thank you for for seven people like from I'm sorry, I can't remember them right now. They get in the a suggestion to allow um saving the seed instead of saving the private key because the seed a lot smaller private key in ammo cam is large so that means when you do decap, you can regenerate a key pair and you do the decad So you pay a little cycles for the kitchen. But if you don't do the decaps frequently and you care about the story, then storing a seat seem to be a lot easier or cheaper than storing a lot don't do the decap frequently and you care about the storage, then storing a seat seem to be a lot easier or cheaper than storing a large decap key. And we are you care about the storage, then storing a seed seem to be a lot easier or cheaper than storing a large decap key. And we allow that in the fifth So that's a definite?

So at the previous IAT meet, we got some feedback, which we incorporated in this new iteration of the document And some of the highlights are pointed out here We revised the wording around hybrid.

So if you use hybrids now you're sort of signing up for two migrations. And this is not something you should do without giving it sufficient thought and in the draft we also proposed a decision tree for guiding people towards one algorithm or another. We got some comments about that and we made substantial changes in this visualization I guess a main change is the fact that the initial version I would say it has a subjective component People asked, why am I guided towards a certain algorithm or another? And what we did in there, version is we rooted it in objective measurement things. So on the one hand, if there is a regulation that says in this particular country or area, if you want to be able to use it, you need to comply with this regulation. So we point which document says that, and that is how you can decide And we also rely on algorithm characteristics, which are measurable, such as signature, time, verification, time key size or signature size.

What are we going to do?

Yeah yeah i mean we're like we said we're collecting the use case feedback and this pessimistic migration possibly with all these algorithms that, you know, that are coming in the future, right, having kind of a companion doc to the engineers document, like, you know, the engineers you know, you read, okay, you learn about this stuff, this is supposed to be con concrete use cases. How do I actually make use of this? case right so that's the point of this so yeah please do take a look at it but i think we want to get through our current docs before we are adopting new So very good. Thank you and talk Tom tom let me undo you and you We can see and hear you. Yes. So but you would probably like your slides up That probably makes it easier for everyone okay you'll run the slides then I can run the slides, and we are, we are nine minutes away from the end, so do, and I know you said you could do it under 10 minutes, but you have 17 slides So do be aware So most of that is actually last time presentation that's just there for people's convenience to refer to later so don't worry it's just for So yeah, I'm talking about hashby signature schemes"

    "text": "around specifically, again uh talking about how to deal with this stateful part of hash-based signature schemes so the XMSS and the LMSs of the world And we, together with a bunch of other people wrote up a little document about this. So if we go to the next slide So this is the slide that's a repeat even still from the last time. Basically we have this divine commandment of thou must not use a signing key more than once without updating the state So you can do that using SHSA, but people also want to be using XMS and LMS. How do we reliably deploy these schemes? How do we run back? and disaster recovery and what do you need to about? There's a lot of footguns here Basically, this document tries to help people not shoot themselves in the foot So if you go to the next slide um we had some discussion on the mailing list and it seemed that people agreed that this is worth documenting at least collecting some ideas, it's never problem going to be complete, but it seems worthwhile, at least to us Some people suggested that we added for example when our stateful schemes appropriate in the first place so that's an interesting, I think, a couple of paragraphs that we could add to the document, so that's in the linked issue is a place to discuss that if you want or of course, just in the main list. And of course, because always see if it's appropriate to add more things to this document but yeah the next slide just says please adopt the as far as work"

    "text": "concerned the document is in a good place to work on collaborative I mean, we can do that, as Paul said, also without being adopted but also it seems good to start moving towards the next steps in the process So, yeah, that's where we're at. The rest of the slides or backup slides? All of the rest of the slides are just literally like time's presentation. Okay if anyone was missed that one, then they can do just go to this meeting's materials and just find that i mean are just literally last time's presentation so if anyone was missed that one then they can just go to this meeting's materials and just find that immediately so since we do still have a few minutes I didn't mean to rush you I thought you did have 17 slides. And this was literally all I had yeah right um who here and rush you, I thought you did have 17 slides. And this was literally all I had. Yeah, yeah, I said, right. Who here, and this, we'll do this on list, who here is interesting? enough, you know, like I know some people are only interested in kems anyways but who here is interested in stateful hash bases? systems? So that's not a large number. I would say for now we probably don't want to adopt yet. And I'm not saying that means we won't adopt But I would say, let's try to work through some of the other signature stuff that there's been on. And again, you absolutely can use the mailing list to improve and to flesh out I'm not really happy with the idea of using the mailing list to encourage interest in a new signature scheme However, we know that there are some people interest and we know that it's a use case in some areas and speaking as somebody who has to deal with DNS SEC, that's a place where made some of this is interesting stuff. So it's not like, oh, this is a weirdo off the side scheme. It's something that's well known. But I would say maybe we don't push for adoption yet until we've hit more of the current work and then"

    "text": "do that Are you scowling at me or? Oh, just because some people have suggested stateful, hash base for DNS sector No, no, no. I hear you. I hear you. But, and again, this working group is meant to be helping the whole IE I hear you. And again, this working group is meant to be helping the whole IETF. We're not like doing it for one scheme So there may be other areas where they care about signature the stateful hash-based ones, even though large would really solve a thing. Then we should adopt this. If it turns out there's really not much interest at all, we might leave it alone But I believe there will probably be interest over time If you, if you let me quickly, we're not proposing new schemes, right? XMS and LMS are already IETF standards. Exactly trying to help people run them run systems in which those schemes are integrated Right. So here's the basic overview on it Um, we can again, this can be discussed on the list. That's fine We'll probably delay working group additional until we've at least gotten through the hybrid stuff that we are working on now I have a hard time picturing a hybrid with a stateful Yeah, but that could be weird. So anyways, yeah Yeah, sorry, my computer died. This isn't a comment about this. I just, I know everyone wants to leave but I just wanted to give a quick update about the positive work we did at the PQC hackathon. Oh yes, this whole group. We've got something like one minute or whatever yeah so at this hackathon you know i think i presented out this in November, so this time we actually got a lot of gag actions working so people can submit their artifacts"

    "text": "So if you want to test interoperally and anybody's new algorithms like what Quinn was talking about, we support them in our project and now you can upload your artifact zip and GitHub action will automatically run, run it against Libo open quantum safe, but we're actually going to add bounce castle as well and even the NIST ACPB vector test, or ACPP, we had to put of our members download those So within, so I did it today. I updated my artifacts. I uploaded it within five minutes I had it in the compatibility matrix it showed you know, what I was compatible with and what I wasn't. So it's a lot of automation we did and it's really positive So if people want to join or test, you know, they're implementations of these PQ algorithms, obviously we're going to be adding like the round four ones and we're going to continue so it'll be a really good way to interrupt with your all this new PQ stuff. So a lot of positive stuff there so so let me know two questions one is are you also planning on doing more work at the hackathon at the next? oh yeah yeah the next hackathon so this is a running yeah sorry it's a running thing and we actually do have monthly meetings every time Tuesday at 8 a.m. EST, our team gets together and meets So if people want to join. That was my second question. Can you send? not only what we did the last time, but how do we participate? between now and 121? to the mailing list? And since your meetings are only monthly, it's fine to actually update the list every month with what has happened. Yeah, sure. And we've also had interim hackathons. We might do one in September as well Just we take a day. So yeah, so I'll send that information on the list. I'm just saying we're not hearing much from you and I see you make a lot of progress. So I think it would be great for you to keep mailing list up to date. Okay. Yeah, I will do that Thanks. Thanks. Good. We're a minute short of being done. Thank you. Please do follow the mailing list a little bit carefully because we are about to start doing working group last calls and such like that. For those of you in the room who have never posted on the mailing list, a work"

That's a perfectly valid thing to say, but an even more valid thing to say is, I read it and I have this minor thing to say, or I read it and there really could be a paragraph or a section here to help me get from this one to that one. All of those are great things, especially for a working group like this, where we're not producing protocols So do please watch the list and strongly consider contributing as we get close to the end on things Thank you very much I always miss up my word"
