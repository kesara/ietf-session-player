So we have a very tight schedule because we have a full agenda but I don't know actually how long those presentation are going to be? But so is does anybody had you know, comment on the agenda for grinding. If not we go forward. So the working group study report. So we have published four new Rf overseas. Since last time? So the Ip and the young and mid models went out and then we have this Vpn solution this document. So we have some work out. That's fine. We have two document in the q if they are... Yeah I one algorithm to history, and then there's multiple key extensions. I think both of them are... Actually they all extensions is very late in the... I think it's an out till forty eight or something like that. Then I. And then we have a one that in the labeled it api basically like last card.

And I I think Paula has promised to do tom you, and I I have promised to review. So be hopefully I can get those but soon not then we can actually kick it out. And then we have the says all had some comments and I think are going to need be doing some changes and then probably make a a second work group last go for that. That we have a couple of documents are still in the process of being the. Alright. So The next is... Oh so Yeah. The next is the dot called the or have any questions about the working group documents or anything like any other that are not covered by the presentations already. Alright. So let's go to the first presentation then paul. With dark team slides. It shouldn't be down anymore cost the working group Cheers. Least say that he's should be doing that. Right. It's a little darker. Okay. So this is mostly stemming from from Toby tobias and me actually work on the implementation, and I have to say that Got much further than I did. So most of the comments are actually inspired by things he found while while, implementing goods. So the first item is that the handling of the spy between the I greek key and optimized wiki is a little different Normally, when you sent a create child to say for the re key,"

So the question was since August I please run into this number of times I had to and figure out how to do this. I think the text needs to be improved at least. On the other option. The other question is like, do we want to use a separate notified for the by to make us more clear or not. Not sure if you wanna do questions per slide because I basically each flight as a question or where I should just do all the I think I think it will be... It's actually up to you, but I think but be useful to have a directly here because Okay. Sure. So Does anyone else comments on this my preference probably is just to leave to the text as it is... Sorry to to improve the text, but least leave the wire format my. Okay. So next slide? The the next one is about went to sent the optimized wiki supported payload. It it it was supposed to be sent an cost, but there can be multiple like exchanges. So which one do you send it? So Proposal here is that the initiative keeps sending it in the first eye and the responder sent it in the last ic got message that it canceled it. Gained, I guess, the most the most protection possible. And it's also the place where normally The traffic like the payload code it's kind of the natural place for this notified to appear. So unless anyone else has any other suggestions will go with this because I don't have a contact proposal."

You'll love to wait two more slides. Okay. So this is about P actually. So Since the first child say it comes with the the the the protection of the the development of the parent to say, like I, there's no associated k with the first child say. So if you re key and that first child let's say, what do you do? So proposal one is just to remember or or or or or or pull back the the the the group I can say and use that one, because that's the one that the original child say used, so you should use the same group. For leaking. Or you say, like, well, this one came in with the parent to say, it didn't be f its own P. So if you wanna use p fast, we first do a regular key where it can change, and it can can be some other value and then we After that, we can do an optimize key if we leaky again. My suggestion is to use the first proposal because it seems simpler. Valerie has the comment here I can't we use both So until you make a full lyric key, as far as understand of the is optional. So until we make a key just to use exchange method from the? But once we would be not the very first tricky. So so are you saying proposal to? Or... No. Using both. So as far do I try is optional. So you can mix it with regular case. So... Yeah. Actually on on a later"

So that's of course an interesting thing because if you then re key it a different group then I'm wondering if you technically are keeping to the spec where you say the wiki is is same. And that's when we doing There's some for From the. I understand but there are some parameters that the d two says during a re key you should not be changing that. And so crypto parameters only use one of them. So if you didn't start changing the k proposal of two changes may the group. change I'm also a fan of proposal one. Okay. Just my opinion. The next slide? Oh there's a W also... Oh sorry. I don't see him in the Go ahead. If you're speaking to, we cannot hear you. He hasn't opened mic So here the the meat echo has you haven't unmute on mid. Just on. Okay. So we'll go on it. You can maybe send it in chat message or"

So you can send a used transport notify and the other either accept or rejected. So the ini has no control of whether this option will be used or not will it depends solely on the responder. So if we're saying a that things cannot change, then we sort of cannot really use these mechanisms because this mechanism to respond they can do whatever they want, and the initiative has to follow. So the question is, are we going to to basically say don't send these notifies and then It doesn't mean not to use them it means use the same as we we did on the initial keying parameters. Or do we say like, you must send to notifies anyway but if we detect that there's a change, then we just throw an error. And so this applies to all the sort of the notifies that relate to child to say properties. Okay. Tobias says that I think proposal two is better because Because the icon child say key payloads are not necessarily the same in particular when using multiple k. I say please talking about the previous slide. Right? About the Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's a fair point. So on this one, two people have thoughts.

But that might mean that you accidentally get one and doing tunnel and thinking should do transport model Well, you just ignore them in use state if if fsa says created internal motors will be into long and just not don't pay attention for the. If if accidentally said, but don't don't send it. Okay. That's Yeah, that might make sense. Yeah. So one of the option also is actually new notified saying that meaning that you still used to use the same settings set before. Because of the idea about there I are consumers that we actually say by, we don't actually send the traffic here on bad and, you know, tricky key would be usually exactly the same parameters. So we could start just to or notify saying that first more D padding, all of those are same that previously. Sorry okay. Third option here to say that we we are not sending in all the same notified. We are not the saying notify that oh. Previous Okay. So I guess that's sort of sort of you valerie saying the same thing. Right? Yeah.

It it it very includes the you know, that So so you you want me to say please include the use transport notify wherever you're not going to include. No. No. I'll the... The first first notify very excellent they tell that they wrote the Fbi. So so we we we would put it the same you know, payload that has that you know, where the sap payload would be.

Sometimes the payload that there will be even more or like that. You still want to be together with the same. Calculation. Okay. Okay. So so the next slide. So then the Ip compound is a little different because it actually it's a payload. It has to Cpi so that is spike of the Ip comp state. So you actually have to send it because that's where you normally sent the new value. So then proposal one is just just send it and and include this Cpi just like you would normally do for a regular key.

And Scott wants to. Give us feedback. Proposal three would be just to just not support Ip comp in this mode because I don't think it's ever used by anybody. While I feel you and I would like to do the same thing. I'm not sure if my draft here is the appropriate place of deprecating Ip comp But yeah. Maybe some tech don't use this. Could be added, but that... No. It should in the user's guidance of the other audio we do. And I'm not really I'm not really an implement anymore. But last time I looked at checkpoint implementation. We had made I pick become disappear and we still have single deaths. That's how that would compatible we we had single desk, but not Ip company anymore. Unfortunately Iot people seem to think that law compression is smaller or smaller is better so see it's seeing some sort of increased popularity. Okay. So so so far, I've heard only alternative proposals and no no thoughts on these two proposals. I'll I'll send a message to the list and just see what other people sorry about this. So next slide.

Like, ignore the exchange and and leave the existing essay in place until it expires until it gets another v. Or do you actively tear it down and I proposal to just leave it in place? So valerie you have some clue? I think that this is a clear the error and which what it's. Because it's just the same situation, for example, when you do regular, Hsa could say establishment And for example, you negotiated to use group a for some reason, please send you group b in key exchange below. Because it just behave improperly. I think it's in invalid centered. But but vincent, if you do and... Let's say you're bringing up a second child and that has wrong wrong things in it that you that you can parse or agree on then you only killed that exchange. Right? You don't kill the existing.

So, what is happening at the it when the fragmentation is is happening, the gateway is res reestablish all the fragments. And then is from these the re reassigned packet is an Ip second encrypted packet and then it is being processed by. And so we have two So What is new in this draft is that if the packet is too big and can't be handled by the what we call the turn interface. Then we cannot actually decrypt. So we have done a re assembly for nothing basically. So all that choose to say that there there are actually two limits that are important for a packet to transit is that we we need what we were looking at is avoiding re assembly.

The size of the inner packet is being updated so that fragmentation has not happened and the packet the resulting I to back. Is not too big. Next slide. So this is why we... I mean, because we have two kind of limits and two kind of scenario we are defining two notification payloads. One which we call Lt a. So link maximum atomic packet notification. So it it is basically the size of a packet that does not generate fragmentation. And we have a packet to big notification to inform that the the the package can't be processed by Ip.

So that fragmentation is being detected by the egress node. The egress nodes proceeds to the assembly operation. And if you can decrypt, the Ip packet is just gonna send and the notifications that some fragmentation has been update are is he's happening? And so upon receiving that notification, this ingress node is actually updating the internal Mt so that the the the source is sending some small packets. And so that's how we solve this re assembly. We avoid assembly operations. Next slide, So where we are. So so far, we received quite a few comments from to attach. And In my mind, we addressed every comment that could be addressed.

And and the reason is relying on fragmentation is is that he wants to the Mcu links and the internal mt used to be to be some a sort of independent notion. But In psych, I mean, even if you look at forty three zero one, we are actually playing with those Mcu size. Between the... I mean, the tunnel and the the the inner packet. So So it's not something that so that contradiction is is not new. And we've been living with that for many years so far. So I don't think that's something that should prevent the work to to happen.
