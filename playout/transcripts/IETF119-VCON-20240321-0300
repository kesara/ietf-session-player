It was not like we had to restructure anything. It's just another parameter here or there. And, figuring out what the relationship was. You know, because of the the structure, we've got, you know, Vecon, and then within Vecons, we have dialogues or parties and things like that. And, in some cases, it wasn't always clear for some of the parameters you know, where the relationship was. And, that's it'll it'll be I'll I'll get to those, the the questionable things. These these were the more obvious things these are the things that I added to, the 3 version of the of the draft.

And, you know, which party hung up in a in a call or whatever. And this is the the the ladder issue. In terms of parties, hanging up or joining a call was something that that that wasn't covered in the recon, but that that I that requirement had come up. And so, What I came up with is an abstraction And, we have the these, first of all, we have these existing dialogue objects, which are, know, you you know, if you have a, a call recording that's, you know, typically a call is is one dialogue object.

Like, you know, this person joined late or this person dropped out in the middle call and rejoined and and that that kind of stuff. I actually, it took these these last two parameters and kind of, Create a new concept of of events within a dialogue. And so, I I defined a number of events which are, you know, relate to a specific party. And so now you can have this, There's a a party history, a array that's part of the dialogue optional part of the dialogue And it it it captures things like party number 3 joined at At this this time stamp. Right? And parting number 2 drop at this this timestamp. You know, and In addition to joining and dropping, We also had the concept of going on hold, off hold, mute and off mute. Right? And so this concept of other events that that, that parties, parties could, that we could track in terms of what with, you know, the the participants were doing in within a dialogue So that was probably the billing major kind of, you know, kind of kinda changed to the year, to the beacon, and it was on the on the dialogue object.

So for a lot of what we would do for this would be We would actually Add attachments as a vendor help us understand how this got to there and then reference The The dialogue If we could. So the the reason why we're taking that approach is because The dialogues themselves, if they're facts, It feels like the interaction type may not be as much of a fact. Because it's almost as if, you know, it's it's it's more it's more it's more of an opinion. So here here's a here's a real life example of that So, the The interaction I'll take a pick of that one here, Interaction. Interaction's fine. So the mind types of text is clear, but the difference between a web chat and an SMS? Alright. Right. And it it might make a difference to the analysis of what you're trying to do if you knew if it was web chat versus SMS. But the mind type itself is actually the same in both cases. So that's why the the flip may be between you know, having more of the analysis and attachments be the thing which vendors use to fill out the the context. And keeps us a little bit tire because, like, there's, again, this There are, you know, we've we think about interaction types, at atstralid, as, you know, email, video voice, But these are very media sort of ideas, not where they come from."

I think you know, I kind of felt like what was also in scope is emergency services and messaging. And we don't have, kind of use cases for those. However, it just, you know, having lunch with with Rowan today and, Ron, May. And, think, that, I think it's reasonable for me to go through Mimi content, the Mimi content draft. Go through that and look at all the metadata in there. That makes sense for wrapping up, you know, kind of a, a, a range of a, you know, a, text based messaging conversation. And, you know, kinda include the metadata to be able to to to capture all of that. And, and I don't think we need a use case document for that. I think, you know, we've got a us back. And we've got a data, model, that, that I think is reasonable for us to be able to encapsulate it in a and looks like Colin. Come on. I'm gonna skip sounds like a great idea. the queue. I I might, but I would say that beyond what's in, Mimi content, you also need the membership"

So you sort of need to know that's almost certainly something you wanna know in this stuff is who was who got added to the group who was, you know, when people enter it and exit the group, which you won't get out of Mimi content. The dynamics part of it, not just the static. Snapshot. As a chain. At any point, be able to figure out in a point in time This message, who was in the group at this point in time at this message, and then who was at you know, anytime it changed. And I was just gonna say the other model you might sort of look at or or a little bit of information is, accent be. I mean, that's a like, obviously, old, messaging content. But much closer to what is actually used in most of the places we probably wanna use Vecon than the Mimi content draft. So it seems like it might be a slightly simpler and also more realistic starting point than maybe content. But both sound great. We've got a fair, fair amount. I don't think it's a big gap there. Yeah. Yeah. agree. No. I I completely Tom? So I'd like to ask the ask a question of the audience here. We had talked to too like to Jonathan Previous to his submission of his case and requirements, internet drafts, And we had said at the time, And I agreed at the time when I still do, I think, that having this a smaller use case document was the right first step. It's not making it too big. Contact center, that's gonna be the right scope for what we're talking about. I I just wanna ask it one more time just to make sure that that no one's feelings have changed. That in the work that we're doing at Stralid, a lot the use cases we're doing are around customer privacy and consent and AI and you know, generative AI cases around conversations. And I wonder if that's not worth a requirements ID or not."

So I'm not screaming that I think we're gonna go really off the rails for what we're trying to do with it. But, but, but, It is major use case we have. So So any ideas on that? I was actually gonna ask a broader question of, you know, we have a number of use case and requirements document. There's also a use case and requirement in this draft. Itself, you know, what Does the working group wanna do do do we want it? Continue to have the all those I mean, I think there is a lot of use cases that people are talking about. So Some we have, acquired a number of them. So you know, I I I just wanted to ask that more general question, how organized we wanted to be about use case and requirements going forward. Looking for guidance. For sure. Yeah. For sure. I mean, just to, you know, to, you know, further ask a further question on that, if I may. Mean, I I'm happy to pull out the use cases and just say that, you know, we looked at you know, and and and and name them rather than describe them. As as use cases that were considered in in in that I mean, is that that what, what people we should we should be doing. Me. People can respond I sort of like that idea to keep that separate from the core you know, definition of the objects. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's they're mainly just from historical perspective. I I I just, you know, I need to something to justify the rest of the document when there was nothing else. Right. Understood. Orie. Orie Steel. I queued, to actually to to pick at some of the security, pieces, in the current document. So Like, I like documents that are"

And One of the things that sort of concerns me about the current document is, like, I know that there are, good use cases for, like, internalizing some of the security components into a conversation. But, like, we're talking about Mimi we could be talking about MLS sort of more generally and, I think one of the things that's a bit confusing, you know, for implementers is, like, if I'm in MLS, why am I talking about Jason Web signatures for, you know, encoding, you know, maybe content and I understand, like, there's a very big difference between, like, This is the crypto layer that secured the original session. This is the crypto layer that's securing my sort of transcription of the session and all of their details. But I wonder if there isn't an opportunity to split you know, use cases and securing the data model and the data model from each other, And if folks might, you know, have an easier time implementing the data model and then have an easier time implementing securing it. And potentially have an easier time sort of understanding whether this is a thing they should do if they could read a use cases so I I know it's extra work, potentially for Murray. But I like I like separate documents. And I think it's easier to review smaller documents that are narrowly focused. So when I was reviewing the attachments piece in particular, One of the things I was sort of not happy about in how I was trying to map it was, like, I wanna do the security and attachments. I don't wanna do the security in in the vcon layer. Like, I couldn't figure out how to make use of that particular layer of the the data structures. And and it's possible that I just didn't understand, 10 From reading it? Ah, I Love, tape.

I I I don't know, enough about it yet to to be able to to to judge that. But, I know I know that it's, you know, we have not implemented any of the you know, vague, becomes referencing, beacons, yet. So I I don't have any, good experience with that in terms of, you know, what, you know, on the issues that are there, and as well as just, you know, the security aspect of, you know, you know, when an know, I signed, you know, if somebody signs this piece, somebody else signs that piece, and you know, you know, we you've got, you know, we want to duplicate data and, you know, there's some issues there. I think that that warrant some more research, and it's actually on the next slide, but, let me go through the stuff here first. So, you know, talk about, messaging. The other other area, right, you know, the use case where I think it was listed in Charter is emergency services. And, there, I'm not sure. Maybe there's a graph that I can look at. I I'll have to see if I can, corner Brian and and get some input on him or suggestions from him there. Just to to look and see if there is, you know, is something that that that documents the metadata that that might be specific to to to emergency services, kind of centers that, that, that I can look at to, you know, to do some gap analysis on that kind of is that there's a list of to dos in the draft.

Next slide. So this is what I was saying. It's like these referential concepts where we refer to groups of the cons and amend or you know, create an amendment of a Vecon or a redaction of a Vecon. You know, this, we haven't implemented, haven't, you know, haven't any real experience with it. And, and, and I, as I said, I think, I need to look at and piece like like, s SD Jose to to, to see if there, you know, there's there's something that maybe makes more sense than than what we've described in in in in the draft. So there's, there's some work work work work it needs needs to be done now. And, you know, like what's the, you know, the the, you know, we we've implemented, you know, JWS and JWE and, you know, they work. Right? But, you know, it's pretty mechanical. But don't have any experience with you know, real, you know, really using that in, in a production type of environment or or in, you know, in real use cases, other than just conceptually, of it.

Give me kind of try if you haven't the, what it leads me to then is just kind of the the next question is, you know, I could ask them the asset of my chair is, Is this is this something that we can, feel it is, solidified enough that that, the the we can, we can adopt as a as a work group draft. Yeah. It'd be good to, get feedback from the group on that. I think We talked about a few things. One is figuring out what we do with use case and requirements. Sort of resonate with Ori's comment about the security, and I think you sort of addressed it. With, you know, the the JWS and JWE and, you know, There probably is some more exploratory. I think we need to make sure there's folks that can take on that work. To do those things, but, So I don't know. Any thoughts on adoption, how are you feeling? I know a lot of work has gone into this so far Do we feel like we any of those things before, or we can fix them afterwards. Yeah. I think I I think the alternative documents much better. We should adopt it. It's no. I mean, like, like, what were you like? I mean, when Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. let me be fair. But, well, I think we should adopt So it. Yeah.

And also, I was looking at the milestones and, you know, it'd be good to kinda Take take another look at those in the data tracker. You know, you can update them at any point in time at sounds like there may be some Possibility that can also confirm some updates to your mile stones in your timeline also on the list. So I'd be in favor of all those things, but, you know, is Murray Show. So I believe he likes what I'm saying. Oh, thank thanks for stepping in. Cool. yeah, I think, We will do that on the list for sure. It's it's all I all I had What's that? I'm sorry. I said that's I had. Yep. all Any other discussion for today? Just a point of information. We we are having a a big the 3rd annual Vecon hackathon, this weekend, and the, The goal is redaction. And detection. And so as Dan points out that we don't have a lot of experience with it, we're about to get a lot of experience with So, and the pipe behind the hunk time of that hackathon so people knows is so they can take take of a beacon that has personal information in it and then redact it. And that's one part of the hackathon. The other part is the opposite. Was there any personal information into the beacon that you just received.
