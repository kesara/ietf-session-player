We we do not have much for grace or much performance in terms level B and C, which is semantic and effectiveness, which is the main focus of 6 c working growth now. And in parallel, we have a very long history and a lot of, like, evolutions in linguistic and pragmatics and astigmatics has been well designed and consider well thought there. So so the idea that we have been thinking of is verticals is already working fine. So technical problems has already been So why not we develop a kind of, a Toyota Machine Learning models, where we can log them in the application layer and how for realized semantic communication networking and some extent. So we have we have implemented a kind of, I mean, ready to supervise has increased semantic extraction which operates in the application layer. And it is on the Linux implementation framework.

But that will federate only the authentication issues. Every other aspect of the trust and security in the network. Will be based on centralized framework. So it cannot be directly deployed in scenario, like remote working or digital products, computing, or kind of, I mean, fully distributed, machine learning scenarios where we want to establish across the So we came up with a kind of, implementation idea that is, again, based on Linux, and we'll be sitting on the top of, transport.

Is a joint work with, Sabine, Liz, Poland. And, next the the the Actually, can you skip this one? Next. Yeah. So I'm gonna be starting with, positioning the problem here. So, Is this a trend where, communication and computer coming together. So with, belief that reached peak central, competes on the centralization. There's a need to actually scale up to compute you cannot more, you cannot throw more transistors to a single to a single core. Need to scale up by adding, by having multiple course running in parallel, and that, which is the concept of communication, to scale up compute. So at this point, where we reached a peak centralization, this need to a thorough compute to be able to to scale up, compute. And so, that means that the the the two walls are merging together. And so if you look at the edge, in particular, that's where we're bringing all this compute to the edge. Be able to run these applications in the scale app, in particular, when you have both computer communication joining, the field together, you start having, physician problems where you're trying to optimized for both at the same time. In party and one specific problem is the applicate, or we call the application lifecycle. When you try to deploy an application, say for since at the edge,"

And so here in this simple diagram, we just show, the service life cycle simplified. You could zoom in and have more components, but essentially you have too many stages. You want to deploy a service, you have the service deployment phase. And after you deploy the service, you have the service instantiation of service So a user actually connects that services, uses that resource, and these are the different faces. But both of them, required computer communication knowledge when you'd want to deploy an application service, you need to be aware how much compute you have, CPU, GPU, storage memory, and also, communication latency bandwidth times, so that you can meet your SLA. So And in the case of deployment, who needs that information? So typically that service provided, the application service provided, trying to deploy this application, say, at theedge. You go once it's deployed, the application, you need to do service selection. So now a client typically needs to, connect to the server. And, establish that, that, communication and compute service. In that case, who needs, this information. So actually both sides. In this case, the network operator needs to know, computing communication information because, it might want to sealed traffic through the through a network. To meet certain, requirements, US requirements. And then also the application the client also needs, computing communication information, make service selection decisions, design to which endpoint you wanna connect, that's gonna the QS requirements are same. So this is the problem space. If, one of the next so, use cases, the arrival of an new class of applications within a stringent computing communication requirements, say, distributed generative AI,"

GSMA or open gateway, working on, creating APIs for developers, that's, I'm gonna provides, such information so that when you develop your application can be such kind of decisions, at the, at design time, PCTP and network exposure functions now and other example of the need to have a way to expose this information from that, from the infrastructure. The positive here is that there's a need for, structure organized way to communication and computer information, from the network player to avoid uncordinated ad hoc mechanisms, and ensure overall interoperability. You wanna go next. Yeah. Use cases. So, on the last site, this with AI computation, that's the example of hybrid AI. So, as we know, you know, we have different layers of computing communication distributed. From the data center all the way to the edge and then to the end device. And so when we do, these queries, these inferences, there's a decisions you need to make on where you actually run the inference. You could run it locally on the phone. Or, you could run it at the edge, or you go it could run it all the way to the cloud. There's a trade off for continuing here. Between, how much compute power you need. So usually when you go all the way to the core, the data center is where you have the the highest compute capabilities. But, but then there's a cost on that because it's far away. There's a, higher latency opposed to do the, the computation closer the device where you have maybe less compute resources, but lower latency, lower costs. So there's a need to make these decisions And again, support these decisions, you need to be you need to know"

If we go to the next one, This, this one actually builds this analogy that, you know, think about what we've been doing for the last do that case, if you will, on the wire on the on the edge side, we've been, the edge has been focusing on communication. So for instance, the follow-up mobility It's one of, intriguing interoperability as as move from 1, you base station to another, or even from one operator to another as you cross borders, that we must make sure that we have interoperability, that we have standards in the protocols on how we achieve this, mobility. So the same concept actually that you have in communication, you could map it and have and and talking about compute, at the edge because, save and the application of driverless vehicles, where you're the car is actually being, being supported on the edge with additional computational resources. In this case, we need to deal with is, being able to migrate these compute, sessions if it will as the car moves, around a region. So idea that you can, kinda, foresee the need to like we did, what we've done with communication, that might also need to, developing internal protocols a, at a compute, at a computational level, basically, to migrate this So that's another this case, and next So defining metrics at the IETF, standardization of network information has quite mature. But when it comes to compute, It's just, I guess, working progress or even all because it's a little bit been done. Right now. So there's a need to define a set of compute metrics.

One is making sure that we leverage metrics across working groups, So we avoid reventing the wheel so that you know, that these metrics are in general common to to a variety of use cases that, these use cases might belong to different working groups.

If not, when the 2 providers are, you know, peering, so they are doing some, BGP, but, you have interconnection in several other spaces. And the second is that, like, yeah, interconnection so far is pretty much, let's say, limited to, IP But, you know, in future, you can have something more than that. Right? So we are in the world of network as a service, network, functions and things like that. So we can be in the future where we don't want just to exchange, you know, I have, I advertise you this epic graphics and you advertise me that, but there could be more resources to it. I don't go computing, you name it. Right? So very simple intuition here. Next slide, please. Yeah. So essentially like, we can go next to slide, once more. So what we did, since the last time, essentially, it's, we, took an we looked at what is happening in other forums. And for example, we, updated like an example of what could be an intent with the, you know, this formula of expectation, target, condition, and context so we looked in specifically at the the mobile world, at the 3gpp. Next slide, please.

So the chairs, essentially, they were asking, like, So what's going on here? So, what is the direction of this draft? So I would say what we are mainly doing is, making friends and building bridges. So, one thing is that we are, of course, looking at what what is happening in other forums. And, they have similar cases, but exactly the same. So we cannot just do a copy paste of what they are doing. But we could go, you know, together, you know, in a, in a similar direction. Let's say. Second thing, which is not mentioned in this slides because it's even more recent than, you know, yesterday. It's that, let's say, in the grow, working group, they are talking about, peering API. Right? So it's a very, very recent work that they are doing there. They did also a site meeting. And so in this, you know, making friends and building bridges, probably we also, you know, look in that direction. Next is light. And, yeah, essentially, this is what we are doing. Making friends, collecting feedback and, you know, if you have any comments, That would be correct. Questions for Paulo? No. It's just a great idea. Yeah. That's Yeah. Yeah. And, Interesting work.

How how do you the envision, actually, that this interaction will will happen across providers, here. And, could you elaborate, like, in in the use case for this one? A little bit more, like, so I would say that, I would see to the main use cases. So in between providers, like provider AM provider be, for example, really for the pairing, then interconnection between, I don't know, a cloud provider and, for example, over the top or, whatever else, right? So and they want to, or, for example, like, you are a cloud provider, let's say, and you that need some computing from there for your big data lake and and things like that. Right? So that could be one thing. So between providers, but I also see and that is probably the work that we were doing in this last, the release of the draft, while looking at the 5 g use case it's not between 2 providers, but probably you are bit inside of the same providers. There is, I don't know, 2 different world that want to talk to each other. I don't know, access and edge, for example. So those would be my the 2 main things where we are looking at. Okay. Thanks.

I summarize also here some of the comment that has been, that I've been raised during the side meeting. One is, that after describing the use case we should have a kind of analysis about the use case order to be able maybe to compare them, to assess what was the difference in commonities. That means also need a methodology, maybe some criteria to do. As already says, maybe the outputs that's buter of the the use case are, targeting a difference. So it means that maybe we need some management or some some modification made in hotline to to, to differentiate the different outputs, which means also maybe different timelines, you know, if somebody wants to 1st having all implementation. So so it needs to be, of course, discussed, if you want to integrate a lot. Also, another comment is that we have to, we should we should make reference to also have a new case that, may have here in both our groups, working groups, CRT, TF going OSR SDRs.

So I think on this terminology alignments could be very useful. My my second remark is, to to integrate maybe in this this discussion about what to do with the use cases, as I said, is what kind of research outcome we expect to produce? So I think there is, individual value, in each of the use cases. And I think we can try also to seek to have, a bit of a collective value across the use cases, so to find commonalities, different is And also, from the research outcome, to capture, you see in which areas the NMRG.

And second is, you know, we call the other outer closed loop, you know, uh-uh, which we really, you know, use some, real data connect from the real network or you can get some intended, you know, information from your application so we can do, some, validation and optimization. And, I think this, you know, actually, the the question we again, actually, it's about, you know, for scenario, generating us scenario evaluation, how do you position in into this architecture? So, we also have some, offline, this for this, we think, you know, for this, scenario generation and evaluation should should not be part of the, you know, data repository, but it should be the digital between network, management entity, And we also think that maybe, yeah, for this architecture, we think may focus on, you know, in the closed loop or actually in green box, you know, try to make it more reusable for the you know, for extra long closed loop, which we will try to, you know, clarify how these, you know, These are know, narrow digit between, as a tool can integrate with these control part or managing part.

So so this way, actually, in this case, we set up the you know, nano digit twin platform or simulation, innovation plan, phone. We try to, you know, simulate a dynamic, rooting and a forwarding pathologic. And so you can actually we can get a new technology data also, KPI data and we can seemingly the whole traffic, you know, goes through the different passive since we set up, you know, the the, you know, low latency requirements.

So our our view, is that as profiles, and this is, not not new. They are they are things that are knowing things that are bigger. So proposal, for this architecture work, to set up a kind of design team, open design team. So this is not closed one that everybody can participate. But the idea is try to have a bit of a more focused activity on to to make a progress and especially to have something quite regular. Online meetings to be able to progress on the key issues. Of course, all, let's say decisions, progress, should be reflected in the draft and, I mean, draft, drafted through and also, towards the mailing list for for for every every person in the research group be able to, to see the progress. There is a question that that we have, and so this is a proposal. Take it as a proposal I think it's also, but the offers are thinking to consider splitting the draft maybe that there could be different splits of the draft that's for for for us for the chair, the rationale is to to be able because this document has been a research document for some time. It has offered our activities table. So the idea of the rationale is to be able to separate aspect that are stable and already consensual in the group. From the ongoing and open research questions or, more, more, aspect that needs to be settled. And also to consider the product, the act architecture, as a final research result and not to to fix"

To consider a part that could be, looking more into the network detail between concept and definitions, essentially, part of the draft that stable and consensual to stabilize this content in, proceed towards that Vacations and ERC then consider to have another props, which could be the more looking into the architecture itself or whatever equivalent will become as naming, but that we look more into the principles, the functionality, structure, operations. So then there is already this work in the draft. But also probably, additional works to to remain there. And to keep this butts, butts, butts, this new document as an open, research tracking group document the idea is to be able to fix intermediate version of this architecture, as a as a walking hypothesis so that when we discuss in the group when we progress on the research have still a reference, but this is a working reference, and we can even have this published then to to be able to to act, as an in progress for France architecture so that when in the group, we refer to something. We have this working hypothesis on the architecture. Keep the flexibility to adapt we measure the understanding of, the NDC, and also to be able to progress in parallel, the different subtopics the different use cases that we think will help us to revise and refine the architecture as we go And then finally, but this is more as a conclusion, to be able to publish, the the architecture itself, the as the conclusion of the work in the recent"

Let's remind the different research questions in this domain what kind of use cases if we want to investigate use cases and really identify focus areas for energy and it is a white, research area.

So for instance, also DTE purely digital twin technology in that network itself too. Research community and industry communities. Also from the standardization and escape and easy variances. There is ongoing work there. And it's good to keep some, synchronization alignment with them. And also, maybe to stress again that even if we are in the scope of IETF and RTF, that we said that the research results doesn't it's not a must that all the research result of the research group must be in the form of an RFC. It is totally valid also to seek other forms of outputs such as scientific papers, could also be tools. It could be models. It could be implementations.

I will jumped in myself and help progress it. Yes. We have to figure out if this is being split, how it's being split. If we wanna if we wanna freeze something which is concept only and not architecture fine, but let's make sure we visibly take the existing draft including architecture sort of out of circulation because you know, rightly or wrongly, it's serving as a reference. Out there and, Anyway, my my basic, point is that, conceptually, on a concept level, there have been some improvement it's it's I'm getting more comfortable with it. I I still think the fundamental disagreement is you know, are we talking about different types of digital twins? Or different applications use cases of a digital twin. In a concept level, you can wave your hands a bit. It's maybe not that important. When you get into architecture, though, That's a fundamental question. Right. And you saw it exactly in your slide where you had the the green box and you started talking about, okay, maybe that green box is really the digital twin. Or at least the core of a digital twin, irrespective of the use case, then you have inner closed loops and outer closed loops. Well, you do in some use cases, you don't in others, Right? I mean, if you have a if you have a management plan planning application, that's using the digital twin. It's not going to have control outputs. There'll be an inter closed loop only, for example. Right. So, I mean, I think the way you approach architecture in these cases is on a modular basis. You say, you know, the core of what we have here is this modeling or emulation or simulation function."

It may be used in some optimization closed loop. That might itself serve inside a control close loop, but these are all use case dependencies. And these are the things that should be reflected correctly, in architecture. Right? So this is what I mean. If we're gonna separate concept from and freeze that and then progress architecture. Let's at least get that distinction, you know, types of digital twins or use cases of digital twin, at least admit enough fuzziness that we don't hammer ourselves in. And then sort of pull architecture out of commission until we can develop it. Further, right, at least make the statement that, look, we we're not equating rigorously a digital twin with network controller. Right? And then we can go and often develop, architecture, as we see fit Again, I don't think there's any disagreement about the fundamentals what the digital twin is. Right? It's not your grandfather's simulation, emulation. It's network coupled. It uses live information. It's coupled to a real network. It's integrable in an operational engine. It is a software artifact. That's the key difference. How it's used and whether or not there's intent translators and control outputs and those are all use case dependencies in my Okay?

So, you know, obviously a lot of, focus and telemetry is packet oriented. So it deals with packet traffic, path this can see, other data, but there is, of course, in different types of network a whole other class of data that's interesting from a telemetry perspective, and that's what's more physically oriented and and here, I'll focus on by way of example, the optical network instrumentation being developed there, and use cases related to, digital twin for the optical network and, fault management for the optical network. Of course, really anything that you know, think physical. So if it concerns energy, wave prop etcetera, etcetera, there may be, parallels next slide. So, you know, in optical networking, of course, for conditioning, commissioning, testing, troubleshooting operations. We've always had these instruments. We we lug around things like, OTDRs can measure, loss distribution, spectrum analyzes, etcetera. But really not a lot of embedded constantly, operating telemetry.

So for the use cases quickly, the the optical NDT and one flavor we've centered, models transmission performance, it requires knowledge and and, modeling of fiber and service characteristics transmission impairments, performance for operating connections. The states reflect the real network condition and state. So imagine we can have these large volumes of continuous time, real number, telemetry measurement sources throughout the network Obviously, that poses a volumetric challenge to telemetry. Next slide. And there's another interesting case. There have been, some developed methods where, you know, if you really develop a large amount of data over a limited period of time, you can take that data off the network and do some serious crunching of that data and some very interesting information. So with, a limited time, data capture of the actual received IQ time based waveforms and a coherent receiver we can through analysis actually reconstruct a longitudinal loss profile on the optical path. Around centered on a certain time interval. Also, it's understood now that polarization dynamic, rotation dynamic how those evolve are correlated to physical disturbance is of the fiber. So you can imagine there's the 2nd mode mostly for fault classification, localization, etcetera.

That slide. Obviously, you know, we need to do sampling. We need to do of the samples. That's what has to go off the network. But I wanna emphasize that it really should be at least couplets. There needs the timestamps to go with the data. Various reasons for that which will become, clear as we go on. Okay. Time precision. Generally, we're talking sort of management time rather than digital time, but there are exceptions, some of those, captures for forensic analysis. Those are digital time captures but over very short intervals. Depending on how the data is being used, whether it's within a closed loop or something else, the time per session or the the correlation among different data sources in time may be more or less important. Generally, it's pretty loose, though. What counts most is the time correlation among samples from a specific instrument Okay. Preprocessing and post processing against something anticipated in, 9232. Obviously, you can do things like lossless, compression, of course, post processing with the compression is unavoidable if you do that. Thresholding mechanisms were anticipated, and we find these quite useful at and that can be you know, you push when you exceed some absolute or proportion the last transmitted data sample you, exceed some time rate of change.

Obviously, you can do things like normalization, conversion to frequency, domain generation of statistics as well. These are all possible pre processing applications next. the kinds of, intense datasets, For for limited times that need that kind of forensic deep analysis. So here you, you, we think you can anticipate some kind of triggering mechanism. Right? So you imagine the within the, within the embedded instrument, there's sort of a sliding data window, and then you look for triggers like for example, if you're, if you're using, using data to reconstruct elongitude and the loss profile and try and figure out where and how some losses appearing in the transmission path well, logically, you would set some threshold for a loss of power, or an increase in noise on that link. That would tell you, hey. Something just happened that's relevant to the loss profile I would trigger a capture, and that's what would go off board for analysis. K. Obviously, the streaming aspect of this, you can appreciate why programmability of those specifically the kinds of pre processing involved would be interesting. Streaming versus polling.

Okay. Obviously, a complete framework, as anticipated by 9232, we would want to we would want telemetry clients to be able to identify what instrumentation with what, telemetry specifically what pre processing capabilities are available in the network. To set up their, subscriptions for streaming to that specific implementation to program whatever pre processing, they want on specific, instruments obviously, that includes applicable thresholds or triggers, etcetera, etcetera. And then, of course, models that govern the applicable timestamp data, value, uploads or vectors, or or batches. Okay.
