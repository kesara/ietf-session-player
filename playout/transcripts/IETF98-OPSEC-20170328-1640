    "text": "directing my my vision to you so we had this problem in the web for a while where you know we want to get all the websites encrypted but in order for having a website to be encrypted it\u0027s got to have a certificate to prove its identity and for ages the process of getting a certificate and provisioning it\u0027s a web server was an entirely manual or mostly manual process so acne was an effort to automate the provisioning certificate within the management of certificates so that we could have automated certificate provisioning stuff and scale up but the encryption of the web so this is the technology that underlies let\u0027s and crepes that was kind of the first use case for it we developed the first version of acne to get what some crepes started but the idea of the working group here is to expand that out and so to make it suitable for use with other cas and get the entire pki that serves the web and other Internet applications upgrated automatable so the primary use case that acne addresses is this case of DNS based certificates so you know websites authenticate their domain names and so I acne provides mechanisms for the an applicant for a certificate to first request a certificate in show up at the CIA and say I would like a certificate with this collection two main names the server / CA respondent says okay you need to prove to me that you own those domain names because that\u0027s what CH 2 and then acne provides it a few different automated mechanisms by which the applicant for certificate can prove that it owns a given domain name um you know it can set up an HTTP HTTP server that responds to certain structured query they conversion some dns records in a TLS basse dance things like that the idea is that the applicant does configure something under that domain name the ca does a probe to see if if that if that thing had been successfully set up and if so consider is that the applicant to have proven he owns that domain and you know once this dance has been completed for all of the names that are requested and certificate see I can issue the certificate so nice thing about acting so that\u0027s kind of the basic flow requests of certificate prove you on the names get the certificate that\u0027s about the entirety the protocol there\u0027s a revocation thingy so you can ask cursor to no longer be valid but that\u0027s a different part of the life cycle nice thing about acne is it\u0027s extensible in a couple ways so it was built with an extensible identifier space so you can define acne for other types of identifiers if you care about mac addresses or IP addresses or telephone numbers we have the drafts right now for telephone numbers for stir and for IP addresses for something i don\u0027t know why they won\u0027t use it but in general you can define a new class of identifiers for acne but then you also have to define some new ways to prove you own those "
