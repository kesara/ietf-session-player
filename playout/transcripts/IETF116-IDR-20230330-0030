So regarding the first one, since Ios six xr does not, you know, support Bg p, So I imagine the you know, the the reference to it in the context of inter drop is not accurate. This is why we put it as an experiment. It's not like, yeah. Okay. So the file referring to the first reference, so perhaps that one, you know, if that's also the same experiment No. The all of them are interrupts. Whichever is the experiment it's written specifically as experiments. We also thought how we with these slides so we specifically discussed on this and put it as an experiment. So do you want any us to put it in a different slider we can do it No. In in any case, I think Ios sector does not support Bg so I think we should probably not refer to of the ios are. That's that's one point.

One of them is focusing purely purely on As sr policy advertisement and the other has, you know, mk ls including Rs tunnels, local Ls cross connect, and, you know, similar forms. Next slide, please. So why we had to do this split is because we were pulling the working group for, you know, implementations feedback and all what we got response was that there is no implementation planned our existing for other than as sr policies.

We really need to know that there are any is an interest or plans for implementation. And in if so please share your feedback or either on the working group mailer or with the Authors.

The Anna notification module is was added to better capture the operational state of the model. It includes notification messages that codes and zip codes.

We did add Ip six six extended community support in the model and also more neighborhood neighbor counters. Add parts was something that was missing at the global Office level.

    "text": "drawing a line in the sand and saying, here's how we'd like to try this solve of the problem. So for As paths, regular expressions, anybody who's were Bg for a long time knows that the syntax across implementations for doing regular expressions is wildly inconsistent. And this means that trying to come up with an vendor neutral model to allow us to actually deal with these things is a little challenging itself. So what we're looking for is a set of functionality that can be dealt with in a vendor neutral way and can implement from the gang model to a vendor specific model without a problem. We've chosen to do is a attempt this is we're going to deal with all the things that problematic about As paths, the fact that, you know, token character token based is probably not but we want most implementations spoke or integer based. Classic reg x's don't deal with this or. Next slide, please. And segment types are dealt with. So we need the way to standardize what the regular expression looks like. We have two flavors of this in the presentation portion of things. There is a format that is abstract in terms of the actual segment types within the model, We don't worry about a canonical formatting model so that vendors can display their various you know, grouping tokens as they choose without imposing one on them. In terms of regular expressions, we're leveraging our Ps which actually has been around for a very long time. Has support for various tooling across vendors to generate regular expressions and covers a, know, very common subset of what x's can do. Next slide, please. So these are are examples of regular expression that you can do in the Rp ssl style of things. So this is potentially a controversial thing to do, but that said, no, there's no industry wide answer for this yet. So this is a place to start the conversation."

Have a very similar problem for community regular expressions, know these are a little bit more standardized across the various vendors in terms of what they do. The problem is, you know, some of the functionality is inconsistent. This means that Ihs has choices to make. The choice that we decided to put into the draft is that we're gonna choose a limited subset of pos stat two, you will recognize this from standard E, you know, if you're your person. And, you know, this means that if you know how to use e egress, probably know what these things potentially look like. What we are doing is excluding specific sub features and this passing stuff format. Next slide, please? So examples of things that we're excluding are character classes c symbols you know, equivalence classes and far more important for some of your implementations graphs, which are extremely powerful feature when your dealing with a outbreak of expressions and communities. You know, that said, we're looking at this is being the baseline support know, there's options for implementations to have better support which will imply some sort of capability advertisement the module to tell you what, know, you can do. But we have to tell you what the baseline can be. In summary, again, these two items here They are controversial, you are highly requested to review these because you will care about the outcomes.

The first one is signaling the top label for the transport. And then second is the next hop coding. So using R eighty nine fifty for Ip four mri, in your thirty two bytes, so Ip six reps or v six with Third, connecting audio gosh. Can you hear me now? Like my audio broke up again. It did drop again. We can hear you once more. Okay. So"

So on the all the customer Brook. Support personnel all signaling gets their payload road model. As well as supports all the options. And then lastly, the before design supports Mp slide. So we had some discussions at the end of last year after It form fifteen. And we had a lot of good feedback and I've incorporating most of the updates into the draft So when Our has seventy nine for was written. Seven routing did not exist. So with this graph, what I in incorporate right into the draft is inner working or operation of how how por would work with s or tls and know start b six and and any caveats that exist. So with that, I have cleared up some of the text just to make that more clear, how on the operation. I also had drawing the and discussions on the mailing. I had some really good feedback from Barbara. Is really good related to our r nine fifty next stop coding and and that as end would and hits its relationship to four p and the reasons why we need a standard for ppe for interoperability of connecting Ip four islands over ip core well as I did spell out and acknowledge that there are other other options available then they that are more transition technology type better in the six man working group. And I've added some comments into the drafts related to that. However this draft the key goal of dispatch is a Bg solution and that's why we here an Id discussing this draft."

    "text": "And the last second glass bullet here, had an extensive discussion related to Bg p and labeling the Ip four prefix that are tunnel over the Ip six core. And So there's there's really three and reading more but there's three really main reasons why the... The pretext is, so the relief for pre need to be labeled So the first one is that if on on the Ph p if you know, Ph default is enabled on on the I'm not that hop. And and the transport manual was popped the the native ip four packet is exposed And if the core is a in generally most, operators have a single protocol for and they're not really deal stack. So it would be an Ip six core that Ip four packet would be dropped. This the second issue with having a... Just a native Ip six packet is that explicit Null segment type road so R c thirty two seventy, and P and then r forty forty one eighty two that talks through The issue related to having a native Ip v six packet So native Ip v six, service label when using explicit all signaling, and and which is not supported it's not allow. So that's the Second item, then The third one is related to explicit all signaling And and just using use of explicit, label to that label or any any other label to signify the protocol type and that's something that it that's important. So there are there are reasons why and and that's something that I'm I I'm So working on updating the verbiage related to that new draft."

And after after this week's It I'll I'll hosts some discussion topics to the to the mailing list And after we go through another round of discussions, I think where we ready for our option. Next slide. So That's it. So once we go through another round of discussions on the mailing list, I think we can get to draft cleaned up and ready for production. Thank you. Again, just a quick note This is an Id r working group. I'm sure you know that Yes. So are there any questions for again for the presentation? We do see they have one question. It will take him a moment. This is stefan defined who has engaged in aggressive sports and it's taking well to get to the microphone. I'm you. Are you able to hear me? Yes. Stefan. So Quick question. I'm wondering First of all, if we really need to do draft for that because it's just technology building blocks that are already designed. We could have a draft just to I would say highlight the architecture job for me more a network design. So Why not having a draft, but it's more information or I would say. Because we are not defining anything new. And as part of a draft, you beyond just Bg stuff, you are talking about some data planes and so on. So"

Ben Madison from mark line just to answer Stefan plans. We run six p to today in production. And we have had to work with enough vendors who have made enough bizarre implementation choices for six p. Order to overcome and drop issues that I think writing this stuff down for four p probably not a bad idea. Whether it ends up being informational where it lives. I'm kind of agnostic but I think writing it down and having a record of it as a good idea. Thank you. Okay. There are no further questions in the room. Thank you for the presentation again. So a couple of final parting notes, again, we have virtual interim on April twenty fourth, and we're looking forward to seeing you there for topics that could be covered. It should be very interesting. And a final request for you before you walk out of the room? You as you can see, there are quite many of you. We have a room that is this large partially her to see if you signing in for the online virtual blue sheets. So if you have not scanned the qr code, Before you leave, please do so so that we can make sure that we get a room big enough for us that time. That it. Sued you have any final comments? None. Thank you. Here. You all at next interim. Have a good lunch."
