So while everybody is familiar well, many people may be familiar the purpose is really to remind people and to have that make sure that people are aware of the various policies that apply And we suggest giving a high level summary, just like what Karen did right now, that the note well as a reminder on policies about conduct, privacy and IPR but not really getting into the meaning of anything. I think getting into the substances outside of the scope of the note well, and outside of its intent So I think encouraging people to read through the policies and make sure that they're familiar with them before participating is key But again, the note well is a- reminder, so just reading that the note well itself is not going to give people the relative"

You know, I think it goes to the fact of not dismissing it and doing it as as a checkmark so giving presenting it and giving a reasonable opportunity to read through. So I think I haven't actually timed myself, but and taking into a fact that there's non-native speakers just making sure that it's up there for long enough that people are able to actually read it because if you're presenting the whole page the whole not well that no well I mean it's let's see the note well itself is about six not the individual policies but if you look at the content of the note well i think they're about six bullets um so hopefully and maybe having that up in an opportunity or as a reference so that people can read it is preferable If we're going to show it, people should be able to read it and as this point.

Has that been vetted by? the legal team? And, you know, should we be doing that? Must we be doing that? All that sort of thing. Yeah, I noticed it at this meeting So I had not previously seen that But I think that the nature of those particular slides really going to conduct and harassment to me, it's a helpful separate I don't know that it's there's no, like, legal requirement to present it, but I think it, particularly if you think that that will help get everybody in the right mindset for the meeting and as helpful reminder to sort of double down on being a good person, I see no problem with it and upside, potential upside there, Japhaz, I'm one of the people that actually started this conversation. Sorry, I'm not in the room The motivation I had for asking for the legal team to take a look at this was that we were having chairs, various sorts, reading data basically a blurb that they thought was a good summary for things, and in many cases, just simply providing contrary advice to what's actually both out of that well or inside the actual policies What you've done here is no, I think, generally good advice but the thing i was sort of hoping for us to get is like two or three sentences of this is what the chair should say that says, read this, no statement, draw some conclusions from it"

I think the what gets us where we enter into a really part is to highlight particularly when you look at the IP or privacy parts that aren't taken out of the note well and you're sort of trying to extract certain what you deem most material aspects of that, that's where it gets risky It's really on the participants to it serves as a reminder that there are all these policies and that participants should be aware of them and have digested them before actively participating because they apply to their participation in the IETF So I know it's not quite as as crisp, but I also think there's a benefit to not have a wrote text each time that people end up dismissing a little bit. I understand but you know, by the same token, you know, three sentences that basically say, you need to read this. I'm not going to read it for you and I'm not going to try to tell you what the look at is that flavor of what we're looking for because what is happening is people are pulling random sentences out of things and providing the focus you're talking about So this is the problem you're trying to address.

I don't know that I didn't put it on there I should, oh yeah, I have it It's never far All right this is better than it certainly was when I started, but that's still what I would consider to be a bad slide in a slide deck"

Can we make this simpler? Because it is not I don't think it's doing what it needs to do Yeah, yeah, we were not the, well go ahead. Just an anecdote, an anecdote for me on this one is that when I very first started working as counsel for the IETF, the Notewell slide came just in a series of email that I was presented with the Notewell slide and I just didn't really understand all of the history of this and so I just jumped in and started editing it and there was a huge allergic reaction like no, this is our text. So there was some significant pushback to changing the slide So that's really, not been the ask of us as could we do this better? I mean, if that's an ask, I think we could certainly consider that and I agree there would be a way to potentially do it more crisply. But I think that that wasn't really the question that was presented to us So my sense has been that the note well slide is there's the legal perspective on it but there's a larger constituency that's that's beyond just the lawyers providing input on this. I don't know that I can ask you with the authority of the IETF, but personally I would prefer to give something a lot less in people's face because nobody reads it This is an end user license agreement type text to the people in the room. At least I don't believe people read it. And I think that's at least part of the spirit of the dues is really that the opportunity for you to present it and say, read the policies to understand, don't rely on"

Also, I just want to say you do some jokes, fantastic. I love it. That's really good good Thank you. russ housley I think of this as notice, all right right I think of this as a notice, right? It is, we reminding people of their responsibility if they want to contribute And it's in every slide deck for every session So keeping it up there to read the reminder I think, is a waste of time They need to go chase all those links not read those exact words. They need to read the policies behind those words And they need to do that before they get here the first time Where's Christian? Yeah, here in remote, because then I was just, I agree with what I've said that this is typically not being read. So if we want people to at least notice when this changes it would be tremendously helpful if this had something like a version of like a last modified date Because people will not, this would be at least one incentive for people to read it ever so often when they notice hey this kind of this changed in the last month and i have"

And so I think if we're going to do it then and if that's part of the policies, then we need to be able to offer them opportunity to read it, or at least flag that it contains important information about the various policies that apply and so that's the opportunity that you have by introducing it as part of the meeting. You get to categorize it And that's why we also wanted to make sure that you can categorize that in your own voice and not just by speaking words that a lawyer put together because most people don't like saying that I think I infer from all this that we've had a problem where some people feel like they don't have enough time to read it or I would aware of my obligations or whatever it is does that mean we should be reminding people on the lists before meeting? because they have plenty of time on their way here or before the leave to go through eight bullets of policy? So is that the advice that we should be? engage earlier? Yeah, I think I invite people to read it before. I think there are many different touch points where the note well is brought to people's attention. I think it's helps bolster enforceability of all of that And so your note well presentation at the beginning of the meeting should not is likely not the first time an IETF participant is seeing it but it's a fail safe, so I worry that it might be and the reason for that is when you're subscribing to the list even if we present it, it's just like an end user license agreement, yep, I agree, yep, yep I just want to get to the thing.

All right. Thanks Mycotookson. My understanding is that the note well applies to all working group sessions and it's not specific to any working group So there is no specific text in there So why do we need to present this? at every working group meeting can't we do this i mean every participant has registered so can we do it somewhere else? I mean, that's a process question that we can look into We sort of came into the culture of the note well as Brad mentioned, and it's something that has been preceded us.

So, you know, there is a thought that it ought to be shorter, but nobody's managed to do it yet That's good. Thanks. This is Dr. My question was not so much on the Notewell itself, but where does it apply? So we are very clear that it applies in the working group sessions It applies in side meeting because we say that, we ask side meeting organizers to describe it. We're there is technically not a very clear understanding even on the website, we clearly says that note will applies at any of the IETF context i think i have copied the text here within the context of an IETF activity And this part, I think our participants don't understand that well. And we don't even tell them like you know what's happening in the hallway conversation is covered in note well That part is sometimes lost. So we need to find a good way to get that across as well Yeah, I think that point taken, I think Brad will maybe speak to that a little bit, but I think the note well itself is just a reminder of the policies and exactly which policy like how each policy has ramifications on various activities will also depend on the nature of the activity itself And so, you know, the anti-harassment really applies anywhere within an IETF, no matter how informal the side meeting is, right?"

And we're now left with a disclosure that exists in our database and as a matter of practical understanding, we don't think there's any real risk of IP here, but we just have this disclosure sitting out there what do we do and I think they're the some discretion built into the system where I think you're you as working group chairs and the AD and as we go through the process, I think you evaluate that and you know just so so if you like maybe two points I would make is one there's an interesting RFC 6702 that talks about strategies for how to get disclosures. So I think this is, my sense is this has been somewhat of a perennial problem not the exact fact pattern I just described, but how do you get parties to update their disclosures and there is some guidance on that or some suggestions and information RFC about how to elicit disclosures But then if you look at actually, in BCP 79, particularly section, 7, there's some element of just judgment that, you know, in a situation like that, where pragmatically we understand there's no real risk of this you know, this is, we can tell this is an abandonment disclosure or abandoned patent I think you can just fold that into your analysis.

So the way we do our patent disclosures, there's an opportunity for parties who are making a disclosure to either check a box like I'm granting a like on royalty free terms, I'm granting a license on reasonable, non-discriminatory, but potentially royalty-bearing terms or I'm granting a license on these particular terms that I'm going to communicate in a text box And in that case, there's some text that has been used frequently. I think Cisco perhaps pioneered it years ago. But the are a number of companies that use essentially the same text And that text talks about if this document becomes an internet standard, then we, the company, making the disclosure, will grant a license under particular conditions And the question was, well, some things don't become technically an ITI standard, so shouldn't we collect the IETF? suggest different language for that text? And I think there was a response on the mailing list about this that I think was accurate which is sort of we collectively the IETF, are actually quite hands-off about what goes into that text box. So that's something that company, have developed a practice for what they put in It's been effective over the years it's something that we see a lot of but it's it's not some So that's something that companies have developed a practice for what they put in.

So I'll pause there. There's a lot of depth we can go into here, but let me pause and see what the questions are kent watsen regarding IPR disclosures, you may a recommendation for the chairs to review and see if there's any that have been abandoned I don't think the chairs are actually equipped to do that to understand whether or not they've been abandoned to navigate the US Patent Office database, for instance I recently learned that the INA organization pre-reviews all the drafts language and in essence to understand whether or not there's going to be issues with what's being recommended for future reservations. I'm wondering if maybe the lawyer or somewhere else could also do something like that in the background where they are reviewed the IPRs and figuring out if any have been abandoned and make recommendations to the chairs Yeah I mean, in general, so the historic approach of the IETF has been, we we require these disclosures and let's see, let me just think about the best way to answer this It would be a pretty significant change for the IETF to try to assess the IPR landscape You know, so your idea would be, let me back up one more step"

I mentioned the Ianna, the International Authority Numbering Authority. Is like pro-act doing some kind of patent clearance? They are, but I just use it as an example. I would just use it them as an example. The real point is could, could IPR is especially important at the time of adoption and again at the time of working group last call And so those checkpoints, it would be incredibly helpful for some background, you know, to occur that would scan assess, and bring back information to the chairs. Yeah so what we get now is we get our disclosures and so if there's something in a disclosure that's problematic, so either if a disclosure says we agree to license on royalty free terms we agree we'll license on ran terms or if there's some text in there, that I think there's a longstanding practice of the IETF to say if it meets certain criteria, we think everything's fine And if there's something problematic in there like somebody has indicated they have IP but said we're unwilling to license then that's something of a red flag that gets addressed different ways. It doesn't always escalate to the lawyers I think there's some practice among the IETF leadership for how to address those situations. There's like going back and asking for clarity, et cetera So that's a pretty well-established process, I think, within the IETF to do that based on things that have actually been disclosed. Doing, like, proactive patent clearance to say like, oh, we really would like to know if this is adopted, are there going to be IP related problems. That's all clearance to say, like, oh, we really would like to know if this is adopted, are there going to be IP-related problems? That's almost impossible to do.

So you mentioned the standard templates that a bunch are coming use for the patent disclosures One thing I would caution for research group chairs especially, we have a least one case I know where the author applied one of those templates on essentially on autopilot, because it's the template they always use because of their company. And then it got published on the IAS stream and of course it is not a standard and so the disclosure didn't perhaps have the effects they had in mind so I would encourage the research group chairs, especially if you see people using those standard templates which say if this becomes a standard, we grant the following things I would encourage the research group chairs to check with the offers that that actually is what they mean because the IRTF doesn't publish standards kathleen moriarty, I just wanted to note that I have seen some disclosures that cover not only what you described from the Cisco example but in the case of draft expiry as well as while it's being worked on as an internet draft. So some do have provisions for each of those Hi, pete resnick There's some really specific language in 2026 and later documents about we don't do patent analysis. And the reason we don't even want to get into this is the bad things in most of these cases"

And you can go to leadership or go to the lawyers and say, perhaps some would like to check with these folks because I think it's no longer being asserted But they've made this claim weak decide based on that claim what to put in the document and move along for us to get into whether the patent's valid, whether it actually applies to this particular document, I think is just a lunatic kind of errand to go on So I think we want tom strickx to the current way that we approach this robert sparks, amplifying what Pete just said Pete, if you're willing to point to the end documents that came after 2026, perhaps on the working group chairs list as a just succinct follow to the conversation we had here, I think it would be useful. Like the note will has a bunch of references to you documents that actually explain the detail knowing those documents understanding what it is as a working group chair that you are and are not responsible for requires weeding all of the guidance that's been provided in the RFC series already Don't just lean on the Lord and the verbal advice that you've gotten from other work group chairs. Go read the advice that's in the RFCs Okay. Thank you all very much If you all have any further questions, you can send them to the mailing list or send them directly to Brad"

We're happy, happy to meet with you We really appreciate you coming today How much time? Go ahead have? Okay, good afternoon My name is ali rezaki I'd like to share with you today some information about sustainability aspects of networking It's great to be here and thanks very much for the opportunity Next slide, please So, sustainability is a horizontal topic much like security. It touches on is a horizontal topic, much like security. It touches all IETF areas. There is now this afternoon, a buff on green metrics. So there are going to be sustainability specific let's say focused action within IETF. But we think that there are aspects of sustainability that touches every working group and research group in IETF and IRTF that Therefore, we want to bring this to your attention as leaders of the groups There is a challenge, of course that currently sustainability aspects are defined at"

Next slide, please So I want to start with this visual expression I drew to show you the complexity of sustainability and that we have lots of feedback loops between the different elements that make up this sustainability landscape It requires a systems thinking at the end You see that at the core we are addressing the environmental aspects with climate change mitigating climate change, but also adapting to climate change There is resource depletion that's can be handled through circularity or materials efficiency Then there are some common aspects renewable energy use, we have heard a lot or companies reporting their sustainability impact and their net zero pledges"

Then there is the relationship with social and economic aspects and that sometimes makes a let's say, really serious impact on anything we produce seeing the light of day. So we have to be mindful of this as well Next slide, please. So given all this complexity we took the liberty of singling out certain aspects we can suggest for attention in working and research groups. Obviously, the single biggest thing we can do and we are trying to do today is reducing energy consumption. But there are other things that will help translate that into environment impact. And those are incredible the share of renewable energy used for our operations managing the traffic loads, the concept you heard probably the rebound effect, Yevon's per paradox. So these are really critical that our investment in energy efficiency energy consumption, to be effective at the end. Because even though we can produce the most energy efficient solution, it can be wiped out very easily. If that affordability translates into a"

So we really have to be mindful. And infrastructure expansion is critical that needs to be challenged as well How does it fair with let's say, in the old days of multiplexing, congestion? QOS, these are all concepts which we use to deal with limited resources, which somehow got forgotten. So should we remember those Investing in circularity also is important in the sense of managing our manufacturing side emissions, but also our impact to natural resources or the longevity of our products As I said, systems thinking and lifecycle and standardization of metrics and following up on those metrics for a long time to see what impact we have. Next slide, please So all of these is still at high level, so we have to really drill down to protocol design level And each working group or research group would have specifics related to that but in general here are some hints"

So please think about environmental parameters energy, greenhouse gas emissions, resource use, when you try to optimize your systems. So like performance versus resource use or, yep So we like approach things in a clean slate approach, but backwards compatibility ensures we reach equipment and do we have seen the DNRG discussions distributed versus centralized architect dedicated hardware use or cloudification we heard data centers manage their resources a bit better than us So what's the secret there? And also power energy proportionation is a key, key topic and that relies on our behavior in protocols as well Are we requesting always on services? Do we send keep alive all? the time? Can we live without this always? on parameter? And if we can, that's all the better Next slide, please. And all there are some challenges We over-engineer sometimes. We include nice to have features, but also we have to remember that we are in a supply chain. We have downstream, upstream, up sometimes, we include nice to have features, but also we have to remember that we are in a supply chain, we have downstream, upstream, and we also are in an end-to-end chain connecting to users and connect"

So let's be mindful of that and let's skip for the sake of time So, no, previous please Yep, thank you So a key target that's set for the ICT industry is halving its emissions by 2030 and we are nowhere near that target We are going steady. It's not increasing, but it's not decreasing as well in a broad scale so we have to do a lot better in terms of emissions reductions So my ask is each working group could have an audit of where they stand and what are the low-hanging fruit? and take out action. And on the IRTF side, I would say that if I were to single out a topic, it would be about limits. The biggest difficulty we have in sustainability is to create a causal link between our actions at protocol designers and and environmental impact at the end. We don't know if our actions will law to a environmental change And just because of that, the safe thing is to establish some limits around our actions. And what those limits should be is the key question, which I think the research community can help us And I can't emphasize more the importance of systems thinking as well"

Next slide So there are three IDs we produced to frame this top-down approach and you are well to contribute to them. Thanks so much Thank you, Ali Unfortunately, we don't have time for questions today, but the slides have a lot of information for you all to take a look at, so please do that Thank you very much for sharing it We have five minutes Five minutes. Perfect. So I should be able to cover it in five minutes. Next slide So basically when I joined the IAB, one of the questions that came up during the ID is looking at what makes an IB workshop successful and how it is different from all the other venues where we make good discussion. And I took an activity I did a like with the help of the past I successful and how it is different from all the other venues where we make good discussion. And I took an activity. I did a, like with the help of the past IAB workshop organizers collected looking at last decades or workshops and trying to learn what are the good practices what has worked well, and what guidance that we can give to the community as well on thinking how to use IB workshop as a venue to spark discussion. We updated our web page and wiki with good information so do check it out, as well as I wrote a blog a couple of months ago and I just wanted to share that with the community as well. Next slide So this is a very high-level discussion of what a workshop is it's basically a gathering of folks experts from a broader internet community. Our aim is to reach out to people not just who participate in IETF, but much broader interest. And perhaps the IB workshop could be a very good vehicle to bring this outside expert opinions into some of"

Next slide One good thing that like the key discussion was what do we consider? as a success factor in a workshop? And since every workshop is very different, our goals of the workshops are different, we shouldn't really look at in a very quantitative terms on what is a good workshop. Instead, we should look at various different factors. Some of the factors are listed here is what kind of conversations happen Would this, were these conversations only possible in a workshop kind of setting? irrespective of like maybe a side meeting or in a boss or in a public working group? session so that is the unique thing that a workshop offers so only if that's a or in a boff or in a public working group session so that is the unique thing that a workshop offers so only if that's so that's the key we wanted to target It's very important that we scope the workshop well The objectives are clear to everyone who is coming into the work if that's, so that's the key we wanted to target. It's very important that we scope the workshop well. The objectives are clear to everyone who is coming into the workshop, the organizations, the follow-up actions, and the long-term impact of the workshop, that's what much more key rather than the immediate effect in some of the cases. Next slide Again, the outcomes could be very, very different Some of the initial workshop discussions led to in fact, some standards work, led to creation of some of the working groups. Some examples are listed there Some led to creation of a research group one workshop led to a much longer IAB program when we realized that the conversation needs to keep going That's the E-Impact one. Some of the workshops were one-off with the aim that we could provide better clarity and guidance to the community And in some cases, it's just community engagement And our aim is to bring in the"

The aim, why I am in front of you is just to tell to the community that IB workshop is a tool that can be employed. When you think that these kind of conversations are better suited in better suited for a IB workshop discussion, we just had a boff and somebody did suggested that a workshop kind of setting could help in going deep down in some of the discussions that were discussed. So again, something to think about And just sharing with the rest of the community And one thing that comes up is who decides? an IB workshop. Usually IAB is looking for a community for ideas. So reach out to any of the other members, write to IAB at IB.org and tell us that why you think this particular topic works well. And when we organized an IB workshop, it's not just the IIB members. We have members from the community, which joins us in the program committee and some of which we are doing for our upcoming ones as well so just wanted to share that because sometimes people don't have a clear idea on who is responsible for the workshop as well next slide I think I have one more which is just a message that we have an eye open meeting tomorrow. We will be talking about two upcoming IAB workshops. If it's interest, come join us in IBE Open and perhaps we can have a longer discussion than my five minutes intro. Thank you Thanks, Drove. So with that, we have reached the end of our time. We don't have time for an open mic today. So if you have any questions things you'd like to discuss with your fellow working group chairs please take it to the mailing list. Also, if you have any suggestions topics that you would like to see or people that you would like to see us bring in like the like the lawyers who joined us to do then you can also send those to the mailing list"
