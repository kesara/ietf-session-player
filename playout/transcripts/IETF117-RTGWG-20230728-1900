But when it goes to the cloud, they will have more reliable connections, and that traffic would be monitored by the ophisticated network functions 2nd is easier to use the cloud based security functions such as firewall, DDoS, and apply constant policy enforcement on or accessing the workload and services.

So these are the kind of multiple reasons the traffic comes to the cloud. and goes the branch to branch traffic follows through the gateway. Next slide. So"

    "text": "this is the extension of the first slide. Like, here, the branch to branch traffic is connected via cloud backbone. So on a geographically, far away branches, can establish the SD WAN parts to their corresponding cloud gateway to access the cloud services in different locations. But when they try send the traffic between them. The traffic goes through the stays in the cloud backbone. they process multiple regions. Within that cloud. So The again, the branch CPs would be connected in the IBGP stations, and the CP is the source CP and the destination CP should be connected over. I EPGP stations to their respective cloud gateway The destination CP could be connected to a even multiple egress gateway CPs for the redundancy reason. That's always possible. The benefits Obviously, the traffic stays in a cloud backbone, and the SLA would be kind of maintained. So all the benefits also carries over from the single cloud gateway deployment scenario. Next slide. So those are the typical 2 different scenarios. Now the solution wise, this is the illustration of the IPSecflow traffic through singlehopcloudgateway. So the key proposal for this draft is to use the genie Geneve Heder indicate cloud transit informations, and the Geneva is have a wide adoptions in the cloud service provider. the sub TLBs carry as a metadata informations and provides a lot of flexibility. So as you see in the outer IP header, gives the source CPE's address and the destination cloud gateway where it is the source CPU is connected to. that it already established."

Then we have a payload. the customer packet, which is encrypted and authenticated. So the cloud gateway, the transit gateway, they don't need to touch the inner packet or the payload. They don't need to open. They just tact on the outer packet and process the genome header to find the at the destination of the packet. So next slide. Yeah. So here is the little more details of the Geneva header, with the option is due an multi segment SD WAN option class. 3 sub TLVs are proposed here. The first one is mandatory endpointsubtlev. Ave, which kind of provides the destination CPE's address, does Second is optional. The originator subtlev, It carries the alternator address The the third is the egress gateway sub TLP. So these are the 3 different sub TLPs currently proposed. next slide. So the endpoint sub TLB has the t l TTL field where it can it, the TTL, and it would be decremented through the transit nodes. So when that packet reaches to the destination, CP, that has a to know how many transit node it travels, or it can also set the max limit. the origin endpoint sub TLB would give a flexibility for the cloud initial cloud transit a gateway to apply certain policies while the traffic travels through the cloud backbone."

That information could be propagated to the so through the some control plane mechanism, And there might be a possibility for the redundant reason, the destination CP might be connected to the multiple egress gateway gateways, So they can include the source can include that multiple gateway sub TLB. So there is also an option We haven't defined, but, like, there are 2 different additional sub TLP is proposed in this drop, which is include transit sub TLV and excludes transit sub TLV. So this gives additional flexibility for the enterprises to specify if they want to for the traffic to follow some specific region within the cloud backbone for security reason or comply with the regulations, they can always do that. but that might be enhanced feature. And Then we have the similar exclude transit subtlvs, the again, the enterprise can include in this sub TLB the list of regions, like, want to avoid for security threat or comply with the regulations. So these are the options. Next slide. So that's pretty much so this this is the first person. I would kind of we would look feedback, comments, in the working group.

Right. So I would really like you to reach out to and we are folks. So they would look into the part encoding and the efficiency of the encoding. potentially I'll start talking to security folks. Okay. Yeah. We have appended the we have initial review done with the security team, and we have put some kind of in in the appendix sections like a 2 options. Like, if you just quickly go to that 1, or do you have a time? There is there is appendix sections followed by this this Yeah. So this is the first options. There is options based the review with the security team ops team. So we can always the there is a choice, the vendor can always include that hudders, followed by IP Hader, and that can carry the the authentications of the full payload including the outer IP, So that is there. But this helps if there is a man in the middle attack, But the drawback is, in that case, that's every node in the transit gateway, it travels."

So the also, we in the these options, it's kind of it requires the PRO is the key management in the CP and the cloud gateway. otherwise, Maybe we don't do anything. The consequences, anyway, the packet drop or the DDoS will kick in in the cloud backbone and mitigate it. So those are the Sure. I see I see -- There's a question. So there is one person in the queue I really don't know how to pronounce your name. please go ahead. Hi. My name is I cannot hear you. Please speak louder. Can you hear me now? Still not. how about now? a little bit louder. Any any better? Little better. Yeah. A little better than that. -- my best. Yeah.

They map into the they are a range different range of UTP tunnels.

Option 2 is through PCE, which is also already implemented. So this not just method. It's possible. Also, you could have using the NetComm on GRPC session to notify the mapping policy, which is out there. So the option 4 here is you can use the flows back in the BGP sessions suppose if the ingress node has a BGP flow spec session with the controller. They can use them flows back to indicate that as well. So for that, the idea hasn't had that option yet. So we have a similar drive companion draft in IDR to indicate how to use the flows back. to pass the policy. next page. So here, just the illustration using the flow spec, how do we map the policy from the source UDP port. to the appropriate different transport path in the data network. Okay.

So, frankly, what you need to do is to map UDP, source range into some identifier. in data network. Picep doesn't allow you to do so. GECF doesn't allow No. No. No. So you really need to look into protocol means to configure mapping from get some you copy from EDP header into identifier of a pass in transport network.

And, basically, the virtue team is working to craft the problem statement. and we will try to describe a problem of interest. And and, importantly, is value to this IETF.

So I will briefly go goes through the problems and we have identified. and basically in a network operator controlled domain. and is a single network operator. And, usually, add this ingress edge devices. yeah, always very rich information. such as this vlan or qinqorvpn access interface, those kind of information. And the usually dose information is used to classify the package into this, the fine granular groups of flows at this edge.

All this EXP for MPRS, it's rebates. which So within the network, and the operator only have this relatively cause grained the queue's treatment. And so it's not very sufficient. to carry what operator's needs. And here are 2 high level uses scenarios And one is single domain. The other is multi domain. But keep in mind, both of the cases belonging to the same network operators admin domain domain. admin control. So first of all, this single domain. and we know that along the packet's path, and the packet treatment may vary at different parts. and they may have different treatments. such as deering, triggering, or identifying. And so basically, here, we want to find an efficient way to realize composite network service provisioning. massage.

And sometimes there is no hierarchical controller. is very expensive to have. And for each domain, they have their own SRA mechanism. So it's very difficult to achieve this end to end consistency in service provisioning For example, if you want to you want to visualize the performance end to end along the path Across the domains, just because you don't have such information. to indicate the granularity of the traffic flow you want to monitor. across those domains. And normally, the ACLs, you will need it to deploy the SEO in the following domains edge devices. at those configurations, are very complex, and also dynamic. it's hard to manage. And here, one more slide on this multiple domains. And here, you will see is there are 2 domains Each of them has its own controller. and there's no hierarchical controller.

It should've been. several side conversations I've had this week, prompt me to restate that this is not about making routing decisions within the network.

I don't see it. just about the the policy, the packet policy of treatment, About this traffic steering, Is it somehow like rooting, So head end steering, I get But within the network, is there any routine forwarding decision being made using APN.
