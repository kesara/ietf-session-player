    "text": "we\u0027ve heard today what\u0027s happening in September I think it is Firefox has proposed turning go and by default CloudFlare and we know that in the short term the reality is that these contract based relationships are all we have because we have absolutely no discovery mechanism so it means is going to be a precedent where there\u0027s a period of time where that is what is happening and with we\u0027re struggling here to figure out discovery mechanisms and ways to do this differently and right now I don\u0027t think any of us think that that is going to happen really quickly so we have to think about this interim period where we\u0027re using potentially a single resolver for all the queries from a single app so we\u0027ve heard that the browser guys are going that way and if you want to think about what that means for your end device you have to think about where the browser fits in to your whole experience of using DNS how much of your cruise go through the browser how much goes through apps and that could be different on a different device so there\u0027s a whole set of questions around what the browser\u0027s do the kind of models we\u0027ve heard the other thing that I want to raise is we\u0027re kind of forgetting all the rest of the apps here which is an N device isn\u0027t just a browser there\u0027s a ton of stuff that\u0027s going on there so what is going to happen in that space are they likely to maintain to just carry on using the system resolver or are they going to follow the browser\u0027s and go down that same route I think there are a few things that will affect that decision one is is that if native implementations of encrypted transports in system resolvers and system libraries is slow and it has been today we sort of slow within a sec we see it slow it being at this so with that being the case and privacy being a strong argument more and more apps are going to consider following browsers and their model we do see an increase in the quality in the range of libraries so it\u0027s going to get easier for apps to make this choice if you can just do something very simply in JavaScript that\u0027s very attractive to a lot of developers and it\u0027s probably quite a low threshold to thinking about doing this in the sense of the question of are their own service to send this to we have cloud for today if we move to having three four five it becomes very tempting if those apps to just think I\u0027ll just hard code this I\u0027ll just go to clarify too I don\u0027t have any overhead and yet I take the privacy requirement in terms of promoting my app and meeting those requirements so again this isn\u0027t a pro scale issue but there are big privacy gains here potentially certainly to be had in the apps in certain context but we really have to think about what is this going to mean for the overall user experience so you could say if all the apps are going to go down this road you could ask for things of them so that the user still has visibility what\u0027s going on you "
