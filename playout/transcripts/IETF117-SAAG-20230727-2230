Good afternoon, everyone here in San Francisco, and those that are remote. it's Thursday afternoon in the security area, so that means it's time for the security area advisory group, SAD, I'm Roman Danilo, one of the second IDs, and sitting next to me is Carlbatis. Alright. We're gonna get started as everyone's filtering in with their coffee and Max and cookies and vegetables and all the other good things I saw out there. I'm sorry? T shirt. Oh, T shirt. that's bonus. I'm surprised there's so many people here. Alright. We can loop everyone can make a loop. There's time. Alright. So, hopefully, it seems Thursday, if you've already seen it, but we have it here that the note well does apply. It's got a number of key DCPs that apply to how we participate here in in the IETF and how we act professionally and contribute to this organization. the the key things to really reiterate here is that we live by a code of conduct where we engage and We engage in productive conversation and respectful to our colleagues, and we focus on the technical work and we're all collectively working for positive outcomes towards a global Internet. Well, wow. Well, there's a little bit of embarrassment. the funny part is We've cut and paste this set of slides for about 4 sats kudos to youpi for being the first one to notice. Okay. I think this is a little bit like Warren's point about no one checking certificates. on the wireless network given that they've been wrong a couple meetings. is literally 3 or 4 slides of cutting at 3, 4 meetings of cut and paste.

We're gonna hear from, let's encrypt in the in the deployment of Acme. And then another topic that we wanted we wanted to bring here really just to get as broad visibility as we can in the security. Security area is that The IAB is considering a program around identity. If folks kinda remember a number of years ago, model T was another IAB program that was spun up to talk about security threats. require really everyone from the security area to to think about. I can't think about identity not being such a cross cutting area, so we wanted to tee this up because the IAB proposing this and they need your feedback. And then we're gonna have a little bit of time for open mic. I'm gonna pause here. Would anyone like to bash the agenda? Alright. Not hearing that. We're just gonna press forward. Okay. So just, you know, kind of some stakes kind of laying them out here. There are a lot of ways to help out, and we really need your help and participation in running and executing what we do in the security area. If you're interested in being a working group chair, please let us know. We put out a call about kind of twice a year. We have a running list.

The authors are kind of in the mode of closing things out and that aren't that that aren't gonna get done and finishing up the tech like you are for most drafts, but they're planning for a new version by the next IITS, and then we as chairs are really hoping to get it to the some time in early 2024.

Next slide, please. So I got this email from the AD's while ago, Teng that were trying to highlight successful adoption of protocols, and what I like to talk about ACME in this venue. So I kinda raised the question. next slide. has acne been successful. I thought it was kind of useful to ponder for a second, like, what makes the protocol successful. So one metric. We got a logo. So, yeah, if you make a cool enough protocol in the IETF, talk to Greg Wood, he'll hire some designers and make you a logo. That's how you know you've made it in the IETF at least. Next slide. 2nd, you know, it's kinda cool to collect metrics about whatever it is in the world that you're trying change with your protocol. Here we had some nice preexisting stuff that Firefox was throwing out Firefox is collecting about how often people are using HTTPS. And the objective of acne was really to make it accessible to get certificates for websites so that we could have https pretty much everywhere. So if you note the 2 orange lines here, like, when we started acne, launch, let's encrypt in about same same time frame. And between there and and when we find finished the RFC, made a lot of progress and have kind of held that progress and approved a little bit depending on how you slice the data. And, you know, basically, Acme drives the web now. Next slide, please. Yeah. So right now, the all the certificate authorities that drive the web PKI. look at their market share, obviously, market share differs depending on how you measure it, but according to w 3 texts. Basically, all of the the CA's that that drive the web PKI support acne in some form."

So there's a bunch of client side software that you can use to get certificates and integrate it with your your your services, but also things you can use to server. Obviously, Watson Crip's CA software is open source. folder, but there's also some enterprise stuff as well. Yeah. Ecker. Can you just go back to one slide? Yeah. So I just wanna call out.

Chrome's number Chrome's numbers look how they're going straight up. Yeah. I think I don't have to proceed to look look at it here. It was here, but, like, that, like, overall number, I think, is is a problem is is is is not correct. So I think may have worked. I I think the solution's better than it looks here. Okay. Yeah.

The bottom has as my favorite new mean, like so I'm community volunteer, put up this website, acmeisuptime.com. but, like, kinda actually captured like, what we were after with with with Acme and SRE culture and whatnot. So finally, the next slide. One of the things I I really enjoy as a sign of success here is it like took Acme. You're like, we we did it mainly to drive the web PKI and get HTTPS up. but it's it kind of colonized a bunch of other applications. You know? So you know, Alexei did a good work on porting it to email, the our working group has been porting it into telephony. Like, Apple picked it up for their mobile device management, which I I I wouldn't wouldn't have thought. So, like, this is kinda cool. It was generic enough. We had the right accessibility points that it it's gone into these other domains. I think we got a couple of cool dimensions of success. We kind of succeeded in the thing we set out to do and, it's gotten picked up in some other places and created some value in some other ways."

We'll just kinda talk through these. So start off with I think something that really helped with next. helped kind of accelerate the acne process is that we shipped it. right away. draft 0 0 was the the basis for Watson crypto when it launched. which let us get experience right away from the start of the protocol. So You know, it started building some demand. People started getting certificates. from a real certificate authority and operating the websites using it. which meant that there was software getting developed using the draft versions of the standard. Now that those create a challenge down the line. Right? Like, you're gonna you know, the RFC is gonna be different from draft 0.0. And so you're gonna have a migration challenge down the line. But the the insight that we got from acting is, like, yes, you're gonna have to migrate down the road. But if you plan for that, and you build that into your plans as you're you're doing deployments. it's not that hard. It's accomplishable and he gets a benefit from all the lessons of running this in in deployment as you're developing the standard. had, yeah, we had a couple insights going back and forth. as we developed Acme from all that deployment experience. Next, please. Another thing we did in the acne process is take advantage of a lot of prior art that was already out there. there's a lot of proprietary certificate APIs, manual processes, And a lot of the the working group, we've got people in the working group sat down with that prior art and the people operating that prior art. and, like, really understood it deeply and did what they could to pull the right learnings into acme. And that was valuable as a technical exercise. Right? You you're technically taking the right bits from the prior art and pulling it into the new thing, but it also have really good community effects because, you know, there's someone who is already doing something similar who's probably a good adopt"

So you you also kind of pull in all that knowledge indirectly in addition to, like, whatever you you full technically from from the existing stuff into the protocol. Next slide, please. Yeah. So extensibility. So one of the things that's cool about how ACME succeeded is it's gone some different places. And, obviously, like, the the classical thing with the protocol is much extensibility do we have? Do we make, you know, something like verifiable credentials? is like work of philosophy and has infinite extensibility in 12 different dimensions, Order, we make something that's like a very specific buyer format and just does what it does. I think the the balance we hit in ACME was to kind of hit the ex you know, have extensibility, but, like, in the spots that we're natural with the protocol, and we kinda knew we already needed. So, like, the 2 key things that I think have have led us spend in the new use cases are validation methods and identifier types. already knew we were gonna have to have new validation methods. This is how you prove you on a domain name because there were multiple things out there in the market already. There's, like, prove that you can answer an HTTP request, sets some DNS records, So we already knew we needed multiplicity there. And so, like, having that an extension point was was natural to the protocol and identifier types are similar when it's about the main names, talk about IP addresses, those came later. But, you know, the idea of having generic, you know, multiple identifier types was natural to what we were doing. And so we built in that that flexibility for it to cover the initial use case, then that also carries onto to a bunch of other use cases. Next, please. something that is I hope getting to be familiar to this out is the idea of bringing formal models to bear on security protocols. Yeah. Shout out to UFMRG. Thank you for your work."

Even in Acme you know, Acme is unlike TLS and MLS, and it's not really a crypto protocol. It's kind of a business logic protocol. So it's it's pretty different, but had some kind of crypto bits in it. So we have this external account finding and key rollover stuff that was doing some, like, max and calendar signature and it needed to fit together the right way. And so we got some formal analysis on that stuff from from India, that that found some bugs, and and we fixed them. So, like, This this formal analysis stuff that's good in building confidence in the protocol when it when it when you get proofs of security, it's good at finding bugs when you don't get the proofs security. I love that dichotomy that either you get a proof or you get a bug and you get something to fix. But, also, like, again, with these community building sort of benefits, much like engaging seriously in the prior art, you know, inviting the formal methods communities into your protocols, like, pulls in more good brainpower to get people smart people to look the protocol and and and figure out, you know, how to make it better. Next slide, please. Yeah. Finally, something we learned even even more so after the RFC was This grease thing applies everywhere. You know, it started off in TLS space. adding random bits to part of the protocol where you that you wanna maintain extensibility around. so that someone doesn't expect that you'll only ever see of these values. And so, like, Acme is based on JSON dictionaries in a lot of like, you can just kinda throw extra fields in JSON dictionaries in principle. But, you know, people build build validation around objects and, you know, might get overly strict and and and be upset when there's extra stuff there. And that's that's kind of impeded son extensibility, building new stuff into Acme, because we're not sure or you need to validate before the the things aren't gonna break before you start adding new things to the protocol.

That's all I got. Thanks. you had a question? Right now, I wanna go. I'm just gonna say that I really like hack me. And one of the things this has demonstrated is the value of automating what might look like a really trivial configuration step. I mean, you only get a certificate once a year. But look at what Acme has now enabled. If we wanted to move to 24 hour certificates. That can now happen. And one of the things that has been the perennial, you can't do that. in ITS is security policy. Yep. The only reason for doing DNS sec was so that you could stick policy, security policy, into the DNS. That's the only reason it made sense to me. The reason that we can't make use of that is we don't have the automation tools so you can't trust the policy in the DNS It's just one administration's opinion, could be different, from another opinion, and so you can't trust it. if we want to get security policy to work, automate,"

It I I think Acme is also a great success. I think it's I I was surprised you didn't comment on part of the reason for that being the crappiness the web PKI prior to let's encrypt. mean, they don't really say it as a question. To what extent was you know, if there were existing kind of obvious pain points in terms of business models and then, you know, at crap lot of different protocols, Yeah. I mean, when when I first sat down, that this one of the one of the things I was gonna highlight about building something success successful is to, like, solve a problem that people care about. that seemed a little fast all because, obviously, everything where, you know, that that one works on, you you feel it's important But, you know, yeah, kinda look where pain points are across the industry. I think that can highlight areas of opportunity. And then I'll I'll highlight here another thing that I didn't remember to put it in slides, but I think another thing it helped us helped acne get traction was that it was built with kinda modern tools like HTTP and JSON as opposed to a lot of the stuff that came before being built on, you know, ASN 1 and things that are much harder to program with these days. So, yeah, I I think solving real problems is is an important thing to do, and really kinda aiming big, like, because acne setups have, like, changed that overall graph. of of the whole Internet. And so that looking at those kinda large scale metrics, kinda point you toward those those large scale problems where where there's opportunity to make a difference. Richard. And, again, it's just honestly it's inspirational to see our technology Thanks, deploy kind of so broadly. That's in a sense of why we're all here. We wanna see that large scale adoption and really large kind of changed to get remember where we were with encrypted kind of connections and let's hard you used to give these certificates and where we are now, so big changes. So it's very exciting. Alright. So moving on to our last topic. So we're gonna talk about who it is."

The IB has been a ring, trying to put together a, you know, a group of people who wanna talk about and think about all the various things going on with identity across the whole Internet ecosystem a little bit. And are gonna speak after me in a couple minutes. You're gonna talk a little bit more about what they're thinking about, some of the things that might be in that. But this is very much just to try and bring a place together where people who are interested in this can get together and think about it. Let's see. You learn more about the program. This this slide has, who it is at ieb.org. That's not correct. There'll be an email list I think at the last one, It's gonna be so the email list to subscribe will get you the right stuff, but it is identity dash discuss at ieb.org is the correct email on it. So it's, you know, usual fun with the tool of updating the slides. It's it's proposal. We're we're It's on the architecture discussed right now. We've been getting some comments on it. We're still thinking about it. And, really, this is just a way for the IAB to try and bring together people outside the IAB, think about what might be needed, what might be useful here in the industry. It's not to develop a a specific piece of work. It's just to sort of identify what's going on and where. And then maybe that will point towards some work that needs to be done, but that's that's not where we at. would that would that would that would that would So I think a much better person speak about"

Well, then keep going with the slides. There's a there's a that's a slide. Yeah. There's a -- Okay. -- just keep going. Yeah.

Right? It's a very big of identity across many, many orgs, in the There was a slide up earlier showing, like, where is some other identity work, and it missed know, half of standard standard orgs that are working on x slide, And identity is a lot more than authentication. There's a lot of different things that people consider as identity. I had a meeting today and was saying, you know, people don't really know what is identity. invited to give a talk at an identity conference in Germany. And, you know, they paid my way. They paid me 10 k. And when I got there, I found out that their idea of identity was marketing identity. It's like, well, okay. You paid me. I'll give a talk, but I don't not It's really related to what you guys think identity is. Next, There's user identity. So here's a bunch of standards around user identity and slide, whole bunch of things around a day device identity. Next slide. and lots of things around workload identity. Next slide. we're gonna swap slides on you right now. Sorry. Oh, slide of it. That's why it's a complicated problem. just to emphasize the complexity. Right. Next slide. There we go.

And, like, I just can't read there. Like, my eyes so bad. This is horrible. So, you know, people don't need to be experts, but they need to have a common vocabulary around what it is. Like, I I Alright. Alright. That's okay. I'll guess what I'm talking about. there's not a common vocabulary. but Right? So as an example, the party that gets some identity statement might be the client, might be a relying party, might be a service provider, might be a verifier. Right? People use different terms for essentially what's the same thing, and it's it can be very confusing to somebody that doesn't have deep knowledge around what it is. and, you know, what you would ask why don't we have a common capital. What's because these things are created in different standards organizations, and everybody's coming up from their particular problem space around what do they need to solve, and so they make up words that make sense for them. so each frame's identity and frames identity in their context. Next slide. So, thinking maybe the first thing we should do before we get a bunch of people talking about identity, that we should get a lay of the land or what are the terms that are used and what does everybody mean by them? So the goal wouldn't be to go and define the terms. It would be grab all the existing terms. put them together and you know, aren't something like relying party. You see also you know, service provider and verifier and client. etcetera. And then the next thing could be know, understanding, like, what it's all the work happening in IETF and maybe some of the other SEOs and maybe creating some 2 trials.

This isn't my first rodeo trying to solve this particular problem. So you may have noted that I was very careful that we're defining anything. We're taking existing definitions and putting them all together.

Just to clarify, this these are some ideas around what we could do if we were gonna do anything. So Yeah. I'd like to agree with Bob only to say that he's really understating this scope of the problem here. I've had a few bit to do with some technologies as a call identity, And I have not the slightest idea what identity is. And I'm pretty damn sure nobody else does I think it's one of those shibboleths that everybody just shatters at people. What I would suggest you do instead is focus on actual problems as they affect the end user, Because many of the problems that when people are talking about identity What they really mean is selling my private data to advertisers. And that's their problem not my problem. I just want to get to a website I just want to be able to add my air miles to my hotel.

West Hardaker, ISI, and specifically, Roman, you called me up IAB member as well. know, a lot of the times for hard problems like this are you goal is not to find a solution. Right? IAB programs exist to think of where do we go? Right? There's a smorgasbord of stuff out there. with a lot of different things to consider can we find a forward path out of this? Can we find at least some common ground in definition to serve as a basis for future work, not because we're gonna solve it here. In a similar vein, you know, there's some confusion sometimes between an IRGF program and an IAB program because we have a common result. How can we come to some place that we can transition this into way future IETF work and IETF standards and RFCs that will be show when we don't feel like we have a starting place today. So from the IAD perspective, that's what I want. I assume Colin agrees. Right? Yes. So that's what we want. where do we go? Good. Thanks, Wes. AJ, you're on the mic. A. J. Stine NIST. I know there was something that was going on with the slide, so I'm sure this is gonna be contentious because I'm gonna ask it anyway since up on topic for everyone. Is this human identities or maybe not human identities because there's, like, an older slide version on this You could I'm not trying to You know, it's a great question, and it's been some confusion. And I mean, honestly, like, think the human got put in we had thought about initially scoping it to just being human in some of the early proposals or or end user sort of style ones.
