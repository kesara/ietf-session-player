    "text": "that's i think where we want to go um in the in a new direction with this so that might mean that we actually then take the structure down um currently which breaks down each sort of feminist principle one by one actually erase that sort of do a really nice sort of literature review first and then develop from there um so i'll i'll just show one example here of something that i think is really compelling maybe for the for the future of the work which is things like this um you could go to this is repository anarchyserver.org where these collections have really tried to almost be an archive of sort of the history of feminism and technology um and that is typically what we find when um these sorts of bodies of work appear it is it's very rare you know we're not we're not looking to just create a wall of text we're actually trying to contribute to sort of a living breathing movement um of of activists around the world trying to solve these problems and this process in the irtf in hrpc today is actually part of that and that we want more people to be able to engage with these ideas um so yeah these are the proposed next steps i think for the research and juliana this is where i really want your thoughts and we'll definitely create some time after this meeting to to talk just the two of us about this but i'm thinking that you know we we might reformat the entire draft to reflect a different you know different structure so rather than going principle by principle we actually now develop a research question a clearer one which is how can intersectional feminism guide the development of internet standards protocols and their implementations we can change that but that would be part of the first sort of re reframe and then based on that being our our north star or our research question"
