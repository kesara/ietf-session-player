We'll probably be going with a down ref. Maybe Joe will speak to that shortly. We have a charter update for some of the new work that we're looking at. And then we will have, short discussions on some of that new work, including the EAP.arpa document EAP, Ed Hawk, and EAP We'll call it Fido for now. Also have a couple of of pre shared keys. Are there any changes to the agenda anybody needs to make Alright. I'm not seeing anything. Shall I pass it to you, Joe? Sure.

Basically what I wanna the the main purpose here is we're taking on We'd we'd like to take on some new work items that have to do with, Eep, the Eep Fido works to, I authenticate users. And then Eepedhoc, which is authentication based on the ad hoc protocol for IoT. So We're specifically, looking to add, some kind of charter goals and deliverables in these areas. So here we have, Just a, an item describing Eeped Hawk, which a very compact and lightweight authenticated to be held in key exchange with a femoral keys that is suitable in constrained environments in which many of the existing EAP methods are not a good fit. Eep Ed Hawk or Ed Hawk offers the useful properties of mutual authentication board and identity protection. The group will accordingly produce a specification for an EAP method incorporating the Ed Hawk mechanism. Referencing the draft. So that's kind of the Updated goal in the charter, and then the specific deliverable is develop and eat method for use in constrained environments.

Cozy specify format for credentials, So you use Any type of cozy header 4 for identifying a credential that's used in the authentication.

Reading the charter text, or the, yeah, while the TLS based mechanisms provide strong channel protections the client does not authenticate and validate the server's credentials properly. Possibly owing to a lack of provisioned information necessary to undertake that validation and EAP mechanism running over TLS that relies on passwords is vulnerable to client credential Theft, much the same as password authentication over plain TLS. Is the photo alliance and the w three have developed a password wiz passwordless authentication scheme known as 502, which combines elements w three c's webauthn and 50 C Tap standards.

I've got a few, MS choppy two handshakes due to misconfigured. Client certificates. A client certificate checks. So That's bad. We want to, avoid that. Passwords are bad because if you don't configure the certificate correctly, then broadcast your password to anyone who has a rogue AP, So we want to remove passwords as well. And the obvious solution TLS client certificates well bootstrapping. That's hard to get the client certificate to the device, They expire, So you have to remind your users to constantly renew them in a b, YOD environment that's very hard, very hard, Next slide. So what we are proposing is an EPLS based protocol. So we again, have TLS in there. But, We authenticate this server by having one string to rule them all, we have a very, precise way of checking if the server actually is presenting a ballot certificate for this authentication, And within the TLS tunnel, we then do the fido authentication, Next, And, that's the basic flow So first, we do the TLS handshake, the server and, asks for an authentication the device checks if the Fido Authenticator"

And it can be done. I tried to have a proof of concept ready for this draft version, but I wasn't successful. But I have a proof of concept that proves that this general concept actually works. Next slide. Okay. So, updates since Prague we finally decided on the one string to rule them all, and I think that one also answers the, the question from Tim from the, the charter discussion, so our current decision is to ask the users to configure the title relying party ID. Which is usually the registered domain for an institution. For example, if DFN was to, to if vital I would put indfn.de and my client would do the rest.

So what's Coming next is, a proof of concept implementation. I started it during the hackathon. I'm not finished yet. We need that to understand what other features the the protocol should have. For example, we want to have an eep method that fails a bit more gracefully than Failed. Because most eat methods just say failed and then You're standing there? Have no idea what actually went wrong. We have to add more text around Fido and CTP 2. The section is currently mostly established, which is a result of me not knowing the Fido specifications good enough to write Really? Good text around it if they're some people from that are experienced in Fido, please contact me. I'm happy to collaborate, and to to learn a lot about this stuff. For example, multiple fido signatures, Thank you. What's Should we do if multiple credentials are registered for the same realm. How we do do we deal with that?

So I use Seabor. Comes with a territory. In radius and AP, we are quite set on TLVs. I don't like them, but I can be persuaded to use other than CBOM apps.

Maybe plays a more permanent role, at least in the case of EPLS, but now you're at in the case of EAP Fido, or tango. What I'm trying to propose in my tired state is somehow we influence either the session token hangs around for a lot longer to do the re authentications, and then we can handwave the whole needing to touch your path key or click a button.

And they send to the server, EAP response a challenge, back the server generates its own hybrid share secret and checks the res and the MAC values and the rest is pretty much the same and it provides each success.
