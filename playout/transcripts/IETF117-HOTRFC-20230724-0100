And for the networks, we we will have a global reach and Internet skill services which involve a lot of cord cord of service sensitive into communications with a very high stringent CUSES requirements. And, certainly, there there will be no a single a provider can provide such kind of services we have because it involved any many sections of networks and you know, it's has a global reach that must involve multiple service providers. And so we believe it's a time to solve this very long lasting end to end quart quarter talk service problem. Otherwise, we will never have a true met worse with the global reach. Next slide, please.

So the the idea is very simple. we can just work make this work on the IPV 6 network by introducing a new type of a rolling header into it. We'll have 2 different flavors to support that. once we we call that the main base routing, another we call that the main level source routing, So in this new routing header, we will include the information about the the next domain on the forwarding pass. then only the border gateway router bill look at this rolling header to decide what's ingressing address of the next domain, then put that address into the outer IPV 6 header. So all the other routers on the past will just based on the IPV 6 had to forward forward the packet. So this is the the main best routing. Next slide, we'll have the the main level of self routing. This idea is very similar through the SRV Six, we have a list of domains as a foreign pass. So for each pass, we'll get the an entry IP address and put into the outer IP ASIC header to use that for forwarding packet.

Another one is how do you manage authorization or access to data? And for that, we have Gannett, grant negotiation authorization protocol, which is now almost ready for pretty much ready to go.

But for VoIP, for example, we could put the signaling data through a tunnel and the the media traffic through MOQ, something like that, Next slide, please. or maybe SIP trunks. So SIP trunks are voluminous cause between 2 endpoints. we could have a dedicated tunnel for that.

They want to select a set of packets to drop. the result of this is that You know, this is and to give you a little bit more is that there are two areas that have been standardized now in 3GPP. There's to use LRS for the longer term loops of a 100 milliseconds or so. and selective packet drops that in a tech place in very short periods of time. We are proposing a draft in TSBWG to handle the encrypt and media related to this? but that's a separate issue. As a result of this, we think that there's a couple of areas that we need to probably look at in the transport area and perhaps even the applications area. So I'll go over that in the next two slides. So What 3gpp does now is look at headers in the RTP. and then prioritize what Yeah. is of more importance and drop maybe some that are not of higher importance. And in in the process, it also keeps view of what periodicity these frames occur. But as these media evolve, and we go to AI generated content or others, we may end up with non periodic data. There may be multiple streams that we maybe need to deal with. or separate transport connections and Another dimension of it is that the UDP source of this media, maybe the client itself. for the uploads. all of these relate to problems that the transport we need to look at, the IP transport we need to look I'll go to the next slide and introduce the the other aspects as a result of the"

It should not But what the server I mean, it's not clear what the server will do at this point. The other aspect is that the wireless network depends on the server not doing any because it wants to use as much bandwidth as possible, and it's available. So all of these have fact. both the applications area. and the transport area. And I just wanted to bring that into attention. we've only begun to look at this. So this is pretty pretty early.

So why do we care about path validation? So what is path validation? actually comes from the routing security several attacks. So now we have a rocking hijack. We have route injection. We have route leak And then people start to think, can we have a mechanism? that can secure the path of a routing. And then we have the famous BGP Second RPGI. So that's great. great work. But the minor problem is Although, like, we have, like, planned a desired had. but the actual like, in the data plane, the traffic could take a complete different path. So it could, like, take a detour and that it makes a classical, like, route injection attack So in this case, problem the minor problem is that this BGP 2nd, all kinds of RPI control plane mechanisms cannot guarantee that the planned it path is actually took by the traffic. So what is path validation? So path validation is actually a data plane mechanism, that enforce and verify that the traffic had actually took this this this path that the control plan is secured. So it provide a transit proof to complement they the control plane secure route to mechanism. So what is path validation of word? at validation is a mechanism that ensures data packets to strictly traverse the chosen network path. Now next slide, please. So consider this use case. So Alice is having a confidential business video meeting or very confidential VIP call. So so She wants her information to just only pass these very secure route 1234. So she doesn't want any data of this connection to be detoured and monitored. But here, if we see this option number 3, if it takes a detour and takes the traffic to some malicious and silent notes a different malicious AS AS,"

    "text": "And then this traffic of her video meeting could be dropped could be monitored, could be collectively crypto analyzed. So this is something that she doesn't want. Next slide. So in here, we propose a mechanism that is based by a vector commitment. vector commitment is very similar to a regular commitment primitive in the graphic context So there are three stages. Here, the controller will select a path And here, we can see this route to 1234. and that she will compute a commitment credographic commitment, a very short a a constant size in curing out case, And then for each router, when they are actually routing this packet, the each router will compute a transit proof And this transit proof plus, plus the commitment when they are verifying against each other, then we can verify that if this router is actually this is the correct router that's far forwarding our our data. So here, the security here is the position binding property. So the security here actually needs three conditions to to be met. So number 1, it is the right sorry. The transit proof will successfully pass verification if and only if this transit proof was created by the right node right or must be in the right position and also must be consistent to what we committed in the very beginning. 3 canisters must be met in the same time. In our construction, we use a case as your commitment pornomic commitment was used by Ethereum layer 2 rolling, a rock, Sorry. It's very efficient and there's a constant size of the proof constant time of proof creation and verification. That's very nice. And also, Next slide, please. To back to the Alice confidential communication case, If here, this Tronic kicked a detour, than the node number 4, there's a malicious node at the incorrect position a wrong node round position, he cannot compute the correct transit proof, and this will alarm the owner"

We are looking for joint research if you're interested, look for the full verification to offset. Thank you, Emma. Catch me in the venue. Thank you. Thank you. I think this completes IETF 117 literacy series. Let the conversations begin. and thank you all for coming. I would ask that you take a peek at your IGF 117 participant survey that that comes out after each IETF meeting. Huddl RC is on there, and Please let the folks who do the surveys know what you think of fiber FC and if you find it useful. Thank you, and have a great week. And other than that, we will see you in November, November, So victies, excellent issues. I'll make one small suggestion. Please do. 4 people who are not native English speaking. Could you give them an extra minute? just because it was it fair if"
