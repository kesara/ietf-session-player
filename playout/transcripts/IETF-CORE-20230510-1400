    "text": "the the section that um question provided in the pro request 62. with some editing on my side so we probably all have to critically read this but I think we're going to do this anywhere when there's 13 comes out um so this um lists a number of of ways in in which a CRI uh can be invalid and and one of those is uh it not even be well formed as a CI but there are other requirements and so of course it might be using extensions that are so not supported by the implementation and the the new uh thing here in this subsection is that we now have the concept of an unprocessable uh CI now um at the end of this section uh this is actually diluted a little bit by pointing out that you don't have to have code that detects that a CRI is unprocessible for you if you are not actually planning to do the the processing that would make it unprocessable so the the duty of checking validity the last paragraph now on the screen the duty of checking validity is with the recipients that rely on this uh validity and an intermediate that does not use the detailed information might actually be able to process uh the CI even if it doesn't understand a specific feature that is going on"

    "text": "in the the some detail of this UI so you might be able to perform reference resolution without actually understanding percent encoded text for instance and it's not not your duty to check that the CRI is valid according to your subset of of the extensions that you implement and that means that we uh that the consumer has the ultimate responsibility but also that the producer has the responsibility to create something that actually is interoperable and that's true for both basic Cris where at least we have to check for a valid UDF age um which is already required for for uh checking the validity of the sibo and um for extensions that might have additional uh requirements like the minimal use of um percent encoded text elements so I think that that is a useful to point out that there is no need to actually do excessive checking in particular if you don't even have the parts that you would need for for checking so we we can have intermediary intermediaries that check less and kind of avoid ossification uh by by having each intermediary check everything um okay so this this um addresses part of 44 but"

    "text": "the rest of issue 44 where we write up what minimal uh use actually is that that still requires some some text to be written so that's uh the the one big thing that's uh Missing uh for doing Dash 13. um so the the interesting part here about unprocessable Cris is that uh you can still handle them I mean you don't have to blow up all your processing just because you uh come across an unprocessable CRI it is just not processable as a CI by itself so you should have some some code in your uh implementation that allows you to handle unpossible uh Cris to get maximum robustness and the the text that is now the second on the screen is indicating uh how unprocessable Cris compare um they compare a little bit like uh not the numbers uh do in in floating Point implementations except that we allow Cris with identical theorizations to be treated as identical and we may need to uh tweak the word serialization here okay so I think that that is the biggest new uh piece here but it's also something that that a sensible implementer would probably have done uh already now a few scroll"

    "text": "length encoding that's a good thing to do but if it's part of a gigantic data structure like a cosmic or something actually requiring the the CI item in the crossword to be definitely length encoded is that puts a requirement on the implementation that that may be really hard to do because there may be other things that that I mean there may be an image of the code for a device in the Hedge crossword so you may have some need for for indefinite links encoding for other parts of the cosmet so it's hard to instruct the sibo encoder to to actually avoid um indefinite length encoding for the actual Cris that that are happening in that so that's why I'm always a little bit careful with mandates like this so the the remaining issues and one PR I think they are all about the minimal representation remaining parts and editorial fixes them okay and and they're just vectors so all right okay and um Christian I suppose you're interested but uh will be available for reviewing this uh as part of the working request call thank you so Chad said yes just for the people who look at the recording afterwards it doesn't mean"
