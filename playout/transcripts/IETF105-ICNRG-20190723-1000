Moscow so why people are coming at us just get going quick reminder of the IRT F ipi policy if you contribute anything or you are you see anything that you know is associated to to IPR you are expected to let us know soon I see energy has the usual infrastructure we have a main list and a wiki we not used a wiki to know publish info on upcoming meetings and so on these are my coaches day for Ren and go you woman I\u0027m deaf crucial and yes we mentioned we really need a note-taker to start this meeting and note-taking is really a light job and we don\u0027t catch all the presentations just the question and answers so that\u0027s the gist of the discussion and there are no big formal requirements so any text notes what we find out ah thanks a lot Janice that\u0027s great okay we have a cool agenda today so we gathered a few updates about what happened in icy energy and I see em in general moment we\u0027re not talking about the ICN when program sorry I forgot to update the agenda so Dirk is gonna give us a update of the ICN over 5g draft and the ICN v chillin draft Tasha is some update about the CCM info work we have this our ICN lopen group item that has evolved very nicely so Thomas is actually given an update on this and if we think it\u0027s there are pretty pretty "

    "text": "steps it has to so called this service discovery profile resolution and the actual name based routing solution it\u0027s unfortunately all called name resolution function which is the thing that I disagree with me but it actually makes sure that differentiate these two different steps so it says yes I want to do I don\u0027t know an authentication management function and it\u0027s Dave being in the u.s. under their subscriber ID please give me an actual real name I can route on and that\u0027s the very first step the second step is the one once I have that name how do I get to the instance action conservator and and it seems it might be quite useful because it\u0027s very similar to what the movie first it they actually make these two different steps quite clear in the actual draft that there are two different problems but it says in our system that we don\u0027t implement the first one because the first one is a lot about business logic how do you translate a subscriber onto a name you know form a routing perspective you might not care that much about it yeah I can comment on those two things is that the way these parts are written is that we\u0027re describing these at the high generic level so you have the explicit name resolution that you map something at the server like DNS or something like that and you have name is trapping and then we have the third thing which is a hybrid approach where you combine these in some way so I think all of these alternatives are covered at the high energy level in the draft and I believe we have examples for mobility first in the draft as well so you should mention some of these other cases in the director that they are but I think one of the things that\u0027s interesting about mobility first model is that they named the high level resolution service they recognized that there may be many of them I could choose one that\u0027s fast I could choose one that\u0027s specialized I could choose one that certain characteristics so there are multiple different possibilities for that name resolution surface but the understanding is once you\u0027ve gone to the once you\u0027ve mapped to that name which needs to be globally resolvable there you need one so there are different requirements and different kind of constraints on those systems which is part of the reason you want to separate them because in some cases you you you allow for many different possibilities and the other you must have exactly one so thinking about that yeah for the world you\u0027re saying and being very careful to talk about the name resolution service and not the name resolution system or multiples so we what we talked about this that you can have a service that didn\u0027t name or solution and that can be implemented as different systems and you can have things that scale between different applications in R so I should go mean it it\u0027s really the answer okay okay great "
