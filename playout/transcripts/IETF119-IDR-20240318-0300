I believe you're ready to go. Alright. Can you hear me? Jeff? Are loud and clear. Alright. Good. Good morning, folks. This presentation is about, how do we bring in generic metric extensions for VGP. And, we've presented this in the last IETF as well as at the interim. And this is an incremental update. I'm gonna give, some background information as well. My name is. I'm from Juniper Networks. And I'm presenting this on behalf of my co authors. Next slide. Yep. So, this is the agenda. I'm gonna give a recap. Quick recap of the problem statement. And then propose the generic metric, how we can introduce this in BGP."

This is a domain that multiple AS domains interconnected as a, in a common administrative domain. For these intent expressed via many different metrics, not just the default IGP, but, delay bandwidth, and maybe administratively assigned the new metric types. We have ITP, a metric registry defined. So it would be nice to have, alignment, to help the operations in the network. This is, was introduced in summit 3 11 RFC way back with the accumulated IGP. And and the 7311 introduced the EHP TLV. That's the only one TLV that it introduced And the the definition back then was to deep carry the default IGP. Since then, there have been multiple interpretations of 7311 I presented this in the previous, uh-uh, sessions. At the moment, what I would like to focus on and and provide thought, for the entire group is the AGP attribute, suffers the attributes scoping, of which we have talked about in the previous sessions and, what we call as a metric discontinuity. So the proposal that I have for generic introducing generic metric is to get around, this particular issue. Nextly. Alright. So the generic metric extensions, can be encoded in this way. It's a simple TLV. With the any new type, it would be good to have a flags, introduced with a net and there may be some additional, information that can be carried in these flags, like is this metric path discontinuous, is so indicate with the bit"

And the rest rest of the bits is for reserve. Next slide? Yeah. What we are gonna talk about in this session is how generic metric can be extended in, next abdominant capability attribute. This generic metric GLV will be seen as a new capability the NHT attribute, and the encoding is like this. It will have a get it will get a new code. And the data will be the previous slide's TLV of individual metrics. Please note in the NSF Tribute. 1 could carry multiple metric types. In the generic metric capability data. And, NHT is defined, or described in the draft IETF IDR intrepilable Next slide. Alright. Why next stop payment and capability attribute in the past, we had presented if we have to carry this in EIGP, what it would take, or if you have to bring a new attribute, what are the issues as well as NHC. But the proposal from all the co authors, that I would like to present here is why have we chosen in Hc? And here are the reasons. 1st of all, the NHS is defined in the raft, and and it's a good thing to note that provides the next top based attributes scoping. And as it is defined, and it's the is a optional sensitive attribute. This helps in deployment with, you know, minimal, upgrades as they did and it has some operational benefits. Right? So"

Cannot determine that Whether the router up, you know, updated or accumulated the, cost. Or He that particular router did not understand, and therefore, he did not, add or it may be added 0. Well, one will not be able to indicate. And that is what we refer as a discontinuity. And and we look at it as different forms of discontinuity in here. If you go with the NHT attribute, it helps in you know, bringing in the scope, and therefore, we can determine the discontinuity. Right? And this discontinuity is in the end to end generic metric, that has been defined. So the first order discontinuity is the intermediate router does not even support the next top, cable dependent capability. In which case according to the draft, you have to drop the NHT attribute including all the contents, in which case, the generic metric will not be propagated but the receiving router will determine the next of validation. This is according to the base, idea of entropy label draft. And therefore, the receiving router will find out that, there has been an, you know, a rocket that does not understand the sentence is let's say the router supports the next top dependent capability, but is not yet supporting, the generic metric, capability in which case, it will drop the generic metric capability because, this is just the base NHT draft which case, one will find out that"

But then as some of the new metric types that may be introduced in the future is not supported. But the NHT support, the Mitsubishi, Base NHT supports an ability for the in a router to refract the capabilities. And, that's where we are using that flexibility to propagate the discontinued information Next slide. Okay. And and if you have to leverage NHT and these are the ways given that intent is expressed via 1 hour more metric types, and and this is a metric value that is referenced for during the next op reachability, evaluation or, when we do the cumulative competition. So in that sense, if there is a next stop change, naturally, there will be metric, change as well. So, therefore, I think it makes sense to use this, option. Just as a recap for the energy procedures, in in these 4 simple steps, so that's the recap of the, I mean, procedure. So the originator of the route encodes the capabilities and and, it advertises. It also adds in the advertised stop in the energy. Along the along the path to the non originator which does not modify the next top, it will just propagate all the NSE capabilities. And if the intermediate router, does not or or it it modifies the next stop, in which case, it updates, the new next stop that it's gonna advertise and reconstruct the attribute, with, refreshing all the capabilities so at the end with the ingress router or the receiver, when it accepts the route, it will validate the next hop in the index field And and if it is equal to the advertised next stop, then it accepts and then it processes all the capabilities."

The originator, like the NSE, we add the next stop and we also add the generic metric capability including all the metrics that the intent, is going to be expressed at. Here, the the deep, the Big d on the metric. Also, the n is 0. Along the path, let's say then there's a non originator, the intermediate router, that does not modify the next top, It will just propagate in HCI as is, no changes here, even for the general capability. Next slide. Yeah. So and and if we have a intermediate router that does modify the talk. Like in the defined in the NSE, it updates the next hop field. And, it what we are recommending is we it has to retain the entire generate metric capability and all the metric types. Only then the India software will find out what is being sent, as a intent. And for each unrecognized you know, metric time. Let's say of the metric types are recognized. Some of them are unrecognized. So, each of the unrecognized metric type, the debate has to be set to 1. For that particular metric type And, this is what we call as the sort of the what we're presented in the previous slides as a discontinuous path of the 3rd order. The only way to deal with it is at some point of time, you know, the ingress has to figure out as to what, how to deal with this, because there's a router that does not understand this new type. So, which I can cover in the next set of flights. For each recognized metric type, it will have to go look at you know, if my local domain matches with the t telemetry type, that that And, as per this,"

    "startTime": "00:12:01",
    "text": "a very similar logic can be used, which is you add the local cost to the next top and add it to the TLB's metric and then use it. If it does not match, the, the local domain metric type does not match with the deal with metric type. Then you have to normalize the, local cost to the to match with the deal metric type and then you accumulate it. And because you have normalized, you said the big n to one in the TLV's, in that particular TLV's metric flags. Next slide. Shoot her here near the end of your time slot. Okay. up. I'm gonna just wrap it So the receiver, is gonna be very clear. So we talked about this. Uh-uh, next topic, if it is not full, then, internic, genometric is ignored. And, if it is equal to that, what is next top, then it you just follow what the, 73 relevant procedures are. So for the best path competition. So, you add it to the of local cost and then use it or, you normalize and then use it. So if you have to re advertise, followed the previous slide. Next slide. Okay? From a deployment considerations, we would require NEC to be deployed because scoping check is scoping check is required. And, if there is a pack which has, the regular IGP AGP carried are generated in this, both can be compared. And then, The router that model for the next stop, it has to reconstruct the NHC this is all the entire, into an intent is propagated. And at the interest after when it receives, if if it hand if it sees a discontinuous path, either it can discard or put some low preference, or time tracker. Next slide.

And, the sort of general request that we have, for IDR for taking on these works for Beach BLS. Is making sure that the base work that's starting from, is active. Being developed and that there's enough clarity in the Beach BLS document to say what functionality is being added in to glue stuff together And if necessary, refer back to the document in the working group like spring, as an example, that defines how things work. Okay. I I see. But I I mean, so this related with the network slicing. Maybe this a much relation with that he is Right. So and, Kaitan, the the work here, I think, has been discussed in t's context. The t's chairs are aware of this NRP related stuff. And we are regularly asking them about, you know, whether the applicability is being appropriately met. So, you know, there there's some still bumpy pieces for that as the work is I guess, in t's still under refinement, means that some of the Beach BLS work is, early to be at It's too early to be implemented. But we'll work these things through. If you do have a feedback, Robin, or, from the tea's group, just have Papvin or someone contact us and say, yep, this is ready to go.

For the advertisement of an RPA information in a scalable way. I'm presenting on behalf of the Courser's Okay. Next slide, please. Okay. Here's some background. I think just Ryan just mentioned some of this. An RP is, a collection of natural resources allocated on a set of links in a neural network network. Therapy concept is introduced in this RC. New RC, 95, 43 for the narrow size framework And an RBC can be used as underrate natural construct to support, enhanced VPN services or the network side services. The topology and the resource attributes of the NRP is to be collected from the network and distributed to the network controller. Either for the net an ARPU specific past competition or for an ARPU specific network management and as a number of NRPs increase, there may be concerns about the scalability in advertising NRP information using the control protocols and has been discussed in the team's working group. We have a draft, car NRP scalability and then mention some of the concerns and also to suggestions about in the protocol designs, So this document, specifies, some BGP areas based on mechanisms and, with some necessary extensions, the advertisement of an RP specific information in a scalable way. Okay. Next slide. So, here, we list the 2 parts"

So there are we can see that there are 2 possible ways for the advertisement of the NRP specific link information using BGVRS. The first approach is we can advertise NLP information as the, one type of link attributes, associated with the existing and, PGPRS, Lincoln and RI. This can be, easier to with the minor extensions for the TLVs for the link attributes. However, we see 2 issues the number of the NAP increases the first is when the amount of inform NRP information associated with the link will increase accordingly to the number of the NARPs, and this will cause the one BGP out the message very large and may not be able to be accommodated in one single message. The second issue is, with the information of just the one RP need to be updated on the link. With the this, with this approach, the link in Narayan and all the associated link attributes including the attributes for the NAPIs, for all the associated NAPIs, has to be updated together, which will be resulting unnecessary wrote Edward Hazman. And so we consider maybe there's a better way is least here as a a second approach, which is a to introduce a new NRI type in BGSBRS. For the advertisement of MP specific link information. And the attributes of each scenario can be advertised, and updated separately. So the scalability concerns in the first approach can be elevated. Okay. Next slide. So here are the propose the extensions to BGPRS. Basically, we need to introduce a new BGPRS"

In the NRP descriptor GRV, it contains, 1 more NRP cryptor, subtierobies, currently, we just defined the 1 subtlet called an RPID. Which carries, 32 bit nah natural wide the fire of the NRP.

Here, we reuse 1, existing I should be is the maximum link bandwidth, And we also propose to add 2 new, TLEs for NRP information. The maximum link bandwidth COA is used to advertise amount of, big bandwidth allocated to a and NRP, and an RP hierarchy is used to, indicate the level to waste the NRP belongs, in case there's hierarchical NRP deployed on the in the network, Another TLW is called a parent and every TLW I ID which is, to carry the identifier of the parent NRP from which and hierarchical and RPS derives.

For some network, they may not support extend your message. Hey. I got a quick question. There is a flex I'll go that allows you to slice a network. If you want, Does this mechanism and I know what this mechanism is doing. My question is, does this mechanism work in conjunction with flex Algo, or is it supposed to aid Flexalgo, or it is supposed to assume that it'll work in scenarios where Flex Algo is not present. Yeah. It's a good question. I think, actually, Flasago can work together with this approach in my understanding because we can't allow, a few flash algos deployed in network. We have more than more than RPs. A few RPs may be associated with the the same is for the the policy information and for past competition. But still we need to, advertise and not be specific, attributes. Least to the controller. So that is, Yep. Okay. So one follow-up question. Can you summarize it very quickly for us? As to how would this work with flex algo? Is it supposed to aid flex I'll go by giving more data from the network or is it there? It is not to a Flasago. Flasago is part of the natural sizing picture, right, is for the control plane and for the past computation. This is that's for the distributed task commutation.

I think, that's a dependent IGP. on Okay. So if this information is not sourced, from IGP because the extensions are not yet specified in IGP, then you're saying they are sourced locally. You know, again, this is, probably something that we need to be full about where all sorts of local configuration from a router would get source into BGPLS. And my concern is where does the where do we draw the line? Of what information gets sourced into BGPLs. Yeah. I understand your concern. Actually, we also have some other local configured information source to BGPRS. Right? So maybe we can be need to be careful about that, but, if this is something related to past competition.

So first a very brief introduction about APN. And, actually, technical speaking, that is the way VPN in the data packets. There will be a 18 header And that contains some information. And with those information, the network could be aware of some fine grained service requirements. And do the APN head or, could carry the APN ID and the optional APN parameters. And if the data plan is ipv6, And the ipv6 extension headers could be used to carry this APIN header. So we also newly posted this draft in 6 men, and, it will contain more details about this data plan. And, here, you could consider this as a APN framework and there is a 18 domain.

And the we got is a a multiple coexisting flow of, flows back roost And, we need to first categorized them into groups And then further into each group, we need to further categorize the rules into subgroup. And then within each subgroup, we need to evaluate it. And based on the traffic action, extend the community is carried or not, and the key is set or not. So this part is the same as, previously found. And then between the different subgroups So, the evaluation will the first subgroup, and then one either finishes or stops it will continue to examine the next subgroup if there's still any. And then it will, between the groups So here is, if there is a one condition match raising one group So the next, following groups will not be examined. So, again, take APN as a example.

That so in last, years, FCPGP, a discussion we basically discuss how, a new primitive called FCPGP to secure inter domain routing. It was in Prague and we collect multiple feedbacks from the audience. And, then today I'm going to present, the progress things that, how can we address this, comments, comments, so first of all, to keep everybody on the same page, I I will have a very a quick recap about FCBGP. So of course. So FCBGP is a, new secure, protocol that trying to secure both the, control plane and data plane. Oh, sorry. The material seems to be old, so I skip that two pages. That's fine. So, on on a control plane, we have 2, design goals. The first is in the, you know, a case of full deployment, we hope that I've said BGP get guaranteed that any BGP path authenticated by our protocol is the real pass announced by the, on pass a s's. In other words, it is invisible for the adversary to claim that that a 4 to 4 to 4 to 5 to 5 has is authenticated. In the case of a partial deployment, FCBGP compatible with the native BGP, and incrementally deployable. That means FCBGP provides a strictly positive security benefits"

Okay. You have a request to speak softer. Thank you. Which is, which is not part of today's discussion. I can't be softer. Make it a further. So FcBG is built upon a primitive called verifiable routing comm commitment so suppose an f's ASB receives an BTP update from its neighbor a for prefix p. Then ASB is using a falling forwarding commitment to publicly certify its route to intent the next hop to use AST The construction of of FC is actually simple. It's basically saying, okay, I accept a route from my peer a, and I would like to extend this route to my peer and then and, enclosed this in a signature to prove it's authentic So f so from the construction, we can say that as the FPC FcPGP adopts a per pass late validation scheme, for validating a busy p BGP pass, instead of the per pass, validation scheme that used in the BGP 6, BGP protocol, which is, recursively sign the entire pass. Which we believe this, you have 2 benefits the first benefit is the, it has the same security in a full in a case of full full deployment, we can prove that both FCPGP and the, PGP second will know, you will authenticate the entire path if the if the in case of a forward deployment And also in the case of a partial deployment, we prove that FCBGP will have to will have more, security benefits. So things now, that's all the recap. Things now, we have, made some progress and, based on a comment, comments from the audios, in Prague last year, And today, I'm gonna share the, FCBGP, protocol specification in help,"

And the type of the this past attribute is, pending for assignment. And the update list is the list of absence network generated by all the on pass So for each of the individual f's, the format its format is as follows, it includes 3 ASNs, to define the basically, the AS hops, define the, pathways and also it includes a signature to authenticate, this path, and, and also, there's a key that you to be used to can verify the signature. So this essay is a self certifying, basically, So because the because of the construction of CPG, we believe we believe it is the fully compatible with BGP because instead of modifying the a s pass attribute we define a past attributes such that the legacy a s is can forward, this attribute without changing any protocol. The second, I gonna discuss how each, Fc BGP speaker, kind of pros process its update message. Upon receiving a PGP update message, with athlete with FCBGP pass attribute specified, and FCPGP, upgraded as we'll perform the following first steps. The first one is we'll we'll authenticate the ASP attribute just, included included in the updated message And second one, it'll based on that, it'll perform the BGP pass B2B pass pass selection. And afterwards, it will extend this pass, by Andy its OFCs. Let's use this this topology, to basically learn how how we can verify, ASPAS attribute So in this topology, let's assume a s a and a s b and AST, they were upgraded."

The verification is the actual similar. It just just to make sure, that the, each pathway authentically by the FC, are consistent West. The AS pass and the signature is also correct. And then we can see the ASC and a ASQR latency so they can just ignore all the past attributes, let them go through, basically. Let next, we move on to the PGP best best selection. So FCPGP has 2 priority roles, in a second and third positions. So the first, first place is still the highest priority is local preference. The second one is the 4 past validation, which means the AS can find a essay for each individual pathway on a pamphlet. Each individual path leads on this path is authenticated or certified by an essay. This this record is passed as a fully authenticated. The 3rd priority goes to the partial, the partial password addition case in which, the ASKF a sufficiently long subpaths is authenticated that's starting from, Our agent. So this is actually from our theory. We do some theoretical analysis to prove that if, the, if there exist a sub pass, is a fully authenticated is also sufficiently long, then the entire pass is secure, even if there is some latency behind this subpass. So we encourage people to read this, read our proof to the on the print print is available on archive And the 3rd and the 5th sorry. The 5th and the 1st and 5th, the a priority, they are the same.

Finally, I would like to discuss some deployment status about FCBGP. So currently, we're trying to this stuff in, in our network. The the strategy or the principle here is if we want to strategically deploy FC, PGP cable devices, to avoid universally up upgrading all the routers, which is a very difficult to do. Currently, we have built a overlay in China crossing multiple a s's to test the bit to test the basic functionality of the s b of the FCB GP there? So what do we do is we deploy a virtual machine over there and they speak, they communicate with with each other through an overlay to basically pros to generate the f, Fc and to process all all these assets. So his next step is to deploy the FC capable a prototype, or devices, with the, real AS and and, prefixes. So that's because so then we they can start to propagate the actual BGP update. Are carrying the Fc information through all these networks. In concludes, fcPGP is a novel secure inter domain routing protocol, it has built upon a unified, preventive called the verifiable intent, and it's fully compatible with the BGP and incrementally deployable by offering strictly, positive security benefits.

You probably want to beef it up with the rules set I do get what you are But saying. It also says that for certain things like inserting an attribute at CBGP. If you don't have an AS prior to you, you insert a s 0. You want to beef up a rule sets like that to say how can a rogue a as in middle not you know, insert something like that and prove that it doesn't have anything in the front and hijack everything. That's number 1. You gotta beef the rule sets very nicely. Number 2, you're carrying an SKI public key inside that. It'll be good to also explain in the after what happens when the keys are refresh. The entire section is missing. I bet you are probably riding on the fact that BGP sec does it. So Hey. Go refer to BGP sec, but at least having that reference in the draft is important to say, please go read BGP sec for this kind of things. Yeah. Yeah. There are a number of things like that, and I'll send it out to you. But I think you wanna beef that up Thank you very much. It's very good, comments there. Thank you. My comment is just short after Care's comment when you say It's equivalently secure, or it's as secure as BGPsec. Your draft needs to go aways to prove that point And I think after you do all of carers, fixes, you might wanna look on that one. Thank you. Got you. Thank you. Tobias. Hey.

So the, the the first question like, I fully agree that this, this won't gonna end some additional, processing overhead. That's why we we the deployment strategy we hope to discuss here is we want to, define that over the capable devices, basically. It's a strategically selection, not every not every router has to upgrade. So we we currently select trying to find some, like, major ASS. They have the, sort of, like, they already have this kind of a software router stuff like that. They have very strong processing capability to process this stuff. To to a sec to the second question, the the the latency part, because the, the route selection of this latency as should stay the same, So because they have nothing they do not understand that they have, say, BGP attributes. They can follow their original past selection, priorities, like the, you know, local preferences and the sort survey aspects. They can, they can basically ignore what is happening inside this, FCBGP attribute, attribute, So I'm next in queue. And, my first question build on, to be honest, point, I have the slide displayed in question, Anytime you change Beach B route selection, you have a lot of dangers as he's pointing Yeah. And you are inserting something very near the top, and it will be in a partial deployment within a single AS. Which is where you'll run into these problems. If you do not have the path selection rules consistently implemented through the whole AS you can end up with routing loops. So we're we're happy to work through the scenario with you. We're sort of"

One way we we can also get a validity state of rules by connecting our way or as about valid verification. So why don't we take the same pass selection method. Oh, yeah.

So I quite a lot of these questions that folks are asking here will be solved once you look at BGP sec and sort of get the needed What happens So you have created an overlay today. In China. testing. 22 Yeah. That's basically for test it and figure it out using VMs. Uh-huh. And, you said that that would be the strategy to go forward moving forward. If you deploy that, my question is, should you do something like that, which is very interesting, how will you know the routers in the forwarding path that a given path is hijacked. So let me first clarify the overlay. So the the already basically stuff is is only to test our software economy works. It's like the So the the the future strategies that we still want to we of course, without the one that you use over, they won't see the actual things to propagate sort of stuff.

And therefore, a policy decision should be taken whether to drop that path or depress that path, so forth, and so on. Maybe through this a past deduction. Part. I like, if you're, you know, seeing a fully authentic pass, you can accept it for a while. I think what you're saying is you will have to deploy this on the forwarding notice. Eventually, Yeah. Kind of. And then his question comes up to say, well, what's the scale performance? And I'm happy I'm happy to figure it out because, like, currently, we are working on the devices there. Yeah. Okay.

Thank you. Tom, your next in queue. Tom Stricts Clougher, really interested in in what you're kind of trying to do you seem to be relying on RPKI in one way or another is this gonna fail open or fail closed? So specifically if Afrinic for example, has issues or ID Nick has issues, don't want my BGP sessions to start flopping, and I have to deal with a bunch of spurious updates. That's that's a very, very, very great question. I I would say So by by for open, you may you may if, if the arbitrary does not work, I should stop doing this kind of thing or Yeah. Basically, if if if I can't fetch the RPKI certificates. Yeah. My session should still remain up. I think that's the, yeah, that's the plan.

And so reverse pass might actually all look the same because I might be peering with that so how does that agent Uh-huh. So somewhere. interact with the forwarding commitments. My just one of my pops kick out all the return pass data because, well, not what they think they see. Yeah. That's might be the case where you cannot certify this thing. Like, for instance, like, there's there is about some situations, like, in in terms of the traffic engineering, it is difficult to certify like, because it's multipass stuff. Both paths I preferred. So in that case, you just basically ignore that. Thing. Because, anyways, we does not require a fully pass those indication. Anyhow. It's like, per host stuff.

Yes, BDP should tell you where the it's BDP community, 2 feet. Is, is it, is it needed to to deliver this information so we can use, delivery community to filter Cethic. So, my question will build on, Susan, so on the mailing list, The the first question I'd had was towards the instability in communities, So you've addressed that. Thank you. The second piece that Sue is discussing is your building flow spec filtering state, from BGP routes. And I think this is at least clear. Robert Drashuk on the mailing list expressed concern about this. I referred back to the procedures for No. Ebgpflowspec where validation uses the rib So this type of interaction between flow spec and the rib know, exist a little bit today,"

Is that if you're having your flow spec state generated from your rib, basically, you're saying, you know, match any route that you learn that has this community and generate a flow spec rule for it You are actually generating the same amount of flow spec state that is matching your rib no, criteria. So while you are potentially simplifying flow spec configuration. The amount of flow spec state in the system actually can be a very large. And it also potentially can be out of the control of the know, flow spec software, because you know, unless you have limits on the number of entries created, You are under The the amount of, routes, the amount of flow spec filters that will be created will be on the same order as the number of BGP routes with that BGP community. Yes. Yes. That's a good question. We think that, we should limit Destination IP Community Filter in in case of overwhelm DDP flows specification, such, such as we, only limit to 100s 100 of, community filter. Alright. So my recommendation, is to take that feedback and do some scale analysis versus your scenario is versus the number of low spec routes that will be created. Yes. Yes.

You know, the numbers have very, very, very local meaning. So we chose, in our case to put it in inside of the extended community, to allow it to change from one day as to another, I I know this is not the primary use case for source address validation. This is intended to be single AS work but, we should look at that use case for multi AS for this feature if Savnet is going to be looking at that as an option. Do you mean to control the scope of the propagation of the information? So as an example, a s number 1, interface ID may mean interface index, one might mean customer, AS number 2, the interface main mean for the same value peer. So the semantics differ it's in the NLRI, analyze are not allowed to change from one AS to the next one. But communities can. Okay. Will think about Thank you. So you had a question?
