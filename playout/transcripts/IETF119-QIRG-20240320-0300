We can hear you. Good. Thank you. And we also have with us today, Suzanne Wolf who's helping me to run things up here on, state So, let's see. As you all know, is the quantum internet research group. Which is a research group of the internet research task course. And this session is being recorded. We have the usual note well Let me get rid of that so I can see this a little better. The IRGF follows, IEGF intellectual property rights and things of that nature by Wednesday after afternoon most You should be familiar with this. Please check the text if you are not.

So I'm looking forward to the longer version of it. He's going to be giving us today. Second, we'll be timing regimes for quantum networks, which is a, document that's in progress, but not yet public being developed in our own research group. Excuse me. And then, Diego Lopez will give us an update on his internet draft.

So thank you for the introduction and the invitation to speak to all of you today. It's a great honor to to be here speaking to the QIRG. Yeah, so I gave this talk at APS March meeting a a couple weeks ago. When Rod was there and invited me to give a talk to this group, today, I'll be talking about routing in quantum networks. This is a some research and a survey paper that I've been working on with some colleagues at NIST. My co authors are Amar Abane and Vancy Mike, The paper is not yet published on the archive, but will be in coming, weeks. So I will, communicate with Rod to, send him the link once once it's published this should give you a pretty good idea of the scope of the paper. Alright. So just to ground ourselves in in the scope a little more so The purpose of this paper was to survey, literature published since 2017 on entanglement routing in quantum networks, we considered papers that focused on 1st generation quantum repeaters and quantum routers. So we are not in the regime full fall tolerance by any means, we considered"

    "text": "entanglement routing for bipartite entanglement. So not dealing with high dimensional cluster states or anything like that. So just two party entanglement. Motivation for this was you know, really to provide a unified terminology for some of the concepts in, entanglement routing, while also making this problem more accessible to network engineers who may be coming from more of a classical networking background, and we do this by drawing analogs to some routing concepts from classical networks. In terms of the protocols that we assume these network support we have hair related entanglement generation, entanglement swapping, integlement purification and teleportation. So we're assuming these networks can support those protocols And here's an example architecture on the left. Of, know, a simplified 1st generation quantum repeater you so we have some memories. We have the ability to do Bell State Analysis, we have hardware control, we have the ability to do some quantum operations. So gates for doing things like, purification circuits or teleportation corrections, So that that gives you a sense of the functionality of of the the repeaters and the routers that we consider it in this paper. Okay. So, continuing with the theme of of, drawing analogs to classical networks, we can begin to map some of the quantum network functions to different layers in a stack, this is, by no means, a a standard, but, you know, generally as we were surveying literature, we were able to kind of, map these these functions to different layers, somewhat analogously to the OSI model, and classical networks."

    "text": "These different quantum network functions have different scopes both, you know, the physical layer, link layer, all the way up to network and transport, but they also are associated with different timescales. And so, this figure kind of captures, okay, what are the the, the supporting classical communication technologies, that we need to enable these protocols what are the classical processing functions, to support these protocols and how are they implemented so for example, at the physical layer, we're dealing with you know, time tagging, coincidence detection, stabilization that these things need to have you know, picosecond or or nanosecond resolution, So implementing such protocols with classical technologies would require, you know, FPGA or ASIC as we move up and up the stack, we can think about network level protocols. So for, swapping strategies, routing lookups, path recovery, functions like that. These can be implemented in a microcontroller, some kind of network operating system, or SDN controller. Don't have a stringent timing requirements as some of the lower layer verticals, Okay. So let's get into the problem, formalism for quantum routing. Again, this is, not not a standard nor is it in across all of the papers that we surveyed But generally, you know, the, the routing, Problem formalism can be described we have some network, some set of nodes and edges, and idea is that the network receives a set of the the, requests from user pairs And so users will define a request as such where they specify the, the nodes receiving the end to end entanglement They may also specify a delta here. So that's the desired"

And not all papers considered this notion of fidelity as part of the request itself But we, it was our opinion as authors to, include this as part of the formalism as we studied how, you know routing and path computation is actually quite coupled to to quantum, you know, entanglement fidelity Okay. Some some key parameters here shown on the right. So quantum networks are inherently probabilistic and stochastic this is really what differs from classical network, technologies. So we have, you know, probabilities everywhere. So we have PUV here, and this is the probability of generating elementary entanglement on a channel between nodes you and the It's and this probability must take into account the photon source and detector efficiencies the channel parameters, so what's the attenuation what's the link distance how many attempts per per time slot can we can we do on this channel? So this will all these factors inform what this PUV will be and we begin to, you know, consider you know, link metrics and comparisons paths from this. We have PS, the probability of a successful swap. So each router here, has a certain probability of actually doing the swapping operation successfully, if these routers are implementing their swapping operations with linear optics, then this is upper bounded by 0.5 but other implementations"

    "startTime": "00:18:00",
    "text": "may, may go beyond this But generally, you know, this is what we expect swapping success probability. Then finally, we have the notion of edge capacity similar to, to bandwidth in classical networking, And the idea here is that, you know, the edge capacity between you and V is defined as the maximum number of entanglements that can be generated in a single time slot between nodes you and v so this will need to take into account the different multiplexing modes that may be employed, if we're using time multiplexing saying spatial multiplexing or wavelength multiplexing, this all informs the, the edge width or edge capacity. It will also take into account the cubit capabilities at the end nodes UNV, right? How many memory interfaces do they have? How many entanglements can be stored simultaneously. And this will inform us, you know, how many paths can we actually allocate to a certain link. Okay. So now that we've defined some of the key parameters and the notion of requests, we can talk about the, objective of automatic So we want to maximize some notion of aggregate utility here. So on the figure on the right, you can see, you know, some different requests coming in. Between S1 and T1, that's the blue path Also, other requests for s 2 and T2 and we could have multiple requests for that link And as you can see here, the orange and the red paths differ. But they still reach the same end nodes we have these requests, and we want to maximize the total number of end to end entanglements delivered for all requests. So we wanna satisfy, all of them, if possible. A small caveat here is that kinda you know, these objective functions are are not standard or consistent across the papers that we surveyed. So one can make this more nuanced and the objective function may take into account"

    "text": "notions of fidelity support or some sort of weighted maximization if there were some priority, allocated to certain user pairs or requests. So what is the output of quantum routing? Well, it's a set of paths. It's a set of of schedules and instructions for installing these paths, and the, relevant instructions, down to the routers themselves. Okay. So this this may be hard to read on on your end, but, you know, I'll zoom in in a second here. What we did is we provided a proposed taxonomy or categorization of different routing strategies, that we surveyed. So we kind of broke up the quantum routing problem into 2 2 branches here. So the first is routing And routing is dealing with paths. So path computation, you know, how are these paths computed, which entities in the network are computing are in charge of computing these paths and now we can see some analogs to classical routing techniques So there are distributed ways of doing this, and there's some centralized SDN way. So somewhat analogous to you know, the different ways of doing OSPF and BGP, in classical routing, Then there's route installation, and we can consider static routes and dynamic routes. So, so, the idea of static routes is that your network is is hard coded. It's preconfigured to support, you know, hard coded paths. Whereas dynamic routes we are sort of reacting, to network availability, network resources were reacting to the request. And we can decide on on the, the the paths from there. Also considered a suite of optimization algorithms for, computing such paths."

    "startTime": "00:22:03",
    "text": "So we looked at path search on graphs, diikes draws and variants, linear programs, AI based optimization, and we did a complexity analysis of the different categories of optimization algorithms. The other branch of the routing problem is, what we call forwarding. So this deals with, you know, how does the quantum information actually move around? How do they how's it processed and what are what are the behaviors that that the routers themselves will enact. So what protocols are they they enacting on these states. So we have a notion of fidelity support if a request requires a certain minimum fidelity, you know, we can do this passively by, allocating better hardware or more resources to that that request, or we can do something more active using, tools like purification or small scale quantum error correction or error mitigation routines, And there are different schema we can consider from that active fidelity support. Another notion that's very important is path recovery things go wrong all the time in in quantum networks, photons get lost, swaps fail, so we need to have, the ability to recover from changes in the topology and changes in link up down status, etcetera. Needs to be able to handle these expected and unexpected failures in the network. And then, we considered a suite of swapping strategies in different ways to schedule swapping operations across routers in a path. And and I'll touch on some of those in more detail Okay. So, let's talk about some classes of the the, route installation, that we considered. So, proactive routing is the first example. The idea here is that path computation is done before any entanglements are generated."

    "startTime": "00:24:00",
    "text": "Okay? So the, the controller that is, deciding on the, the path and these schedules and instructions, it needs to know the full global, physical topology but this can be done centralized or distributed, like, like, OSPF. Reactive routing on the other hand, We are reacting to the virtual apology of the network. Okay? So, the network goes and generates entanglements, and every so often it will report the virtual topology the state of the network or a portion of the network to the controller. And that controller then will do its it's path computation and continue with with swapping, to get to our end to end path so the idea is path computation is done, not on the the physical topology of the network, but rather a virtual one, and we're reacting to the state of the network. This can be more effective for resource managements and, and protocol scheduling as we're reacting to, you know, the real time state of the network. However, you know, every second we spend path computation here, our entanglements are are decohearing, right? So there's a big latency constraint on on this approach. Then there's virtual routing that we considered. So, somewhat similar to reactive routing, but we're building this virtual graph where past selection is executed So these multi hop links can be combined together to create our end to end path we can decide on these virtual links a priority or we can just react to them, and, and they're generated randomly. However, here at each virtual link, can only be used once, We considered opportunistic routing as well, and the idea for this approach is to kind of build up the path as we go from hop to hop from one endpoint to the other."

    "text": "So we can make decisions hop by hop and define some rules on what the next top should be. Based on local state network I will say that, you know, these 4 categories that I mentioned that can be combined and actually used together. Some papers considered, for example, marrying the reactive routing with virtual routing. Okay. Let's get into the forwarding side of things. So, swapping strategies, a really interesting to consider here. So what is a path? Under the hood, it's a repeater chain. Right? We want to get entanglement from a to e, and there are different ways to do that. Different sequences we can get there So, here are some different schedules that one could install to achieve the same end goal, but they'll have different properties So we considered, what's called synchronous swapping approach where all entanglements are created at the same time and all swaps succeed at the same time. So that's example C there. This has pros and cons so synchronous when things go well, Awesome. We have very fresh entanglement. All our entanglements are arriving at same time. We immediately do swapping. On on on, all the routers, BCND here, and we get the freshest possible entanglement end to end. So very high fidelity. But, everything needs to go right. So, the probability of success is much lower than the others. So, we need many repetitions to do this. Asynchronous, on the other hand, we assume that all the local entanglements are ready before any swapping begins. And this requires memory. We need to store, these entanglements as as we're waiting on other intangements But the idea is we can decide on the schedule a priority and say, okay, hey, router B, you're, you're gonna do your swap first and then router C and then router d. Etcetera. Final one we considered is opportunistic. Where"

    "startTime": "00:28:00",
    "text": "the repeaters act somewhat independently. This is also sometimes called as soon as possible. Or greedy swapping The idea is if I'm a router, if I have my left side entanglement and my right side entanglement, that's all I need I don't need to wait on anything else. I can just go ahead and do my swap and then I'll report the results to my neighbors. So there are other considerations than just swapping, scheduling, and, and the paths so we considered, as I mentioned before, the actual algorithms for optimizing this this objective function. So be looked at dijkstra's path path search on graphs, read algorithms, LPs and AI based. So we, we did a complexity analysis of those there's some interesting questions that arose in, in the notion of fidelity support. So passive fidelity support versus active. You know, do we purify on local links and then swap, or do we swap first and then purify on longer distance links there's no one size fits all here. It depends on your network, and your node capabilities. Also, purification is, there's no one size fits all there either. So different purifications, games, and circuits use different numbers of resources. Consume different numbers of belt pairs and they require certain, computational capabilities at the nodes themselves. And the point here is, you know, link the link cost metrics, become more complicated as we consider this fidelity support how do we how do we compare a proposed path a to a proposed path b what are the right link metrics to consider and how do we combine those link metrics to compare one path to another path. Then finally, Path recovery, this is something that we found somewhat lacking in the literature a lot of the the literature proposed routing strategies, considering the happy path when everything is right,"

How do we install, for example, our alternate routes or alternate paths but we need to be able to handle decoherence, photon loss, and the operational errors themselves. And when things go wrong, You know, there are different things we can do. Right? Do we regenerate entanglement, if it's too old, or do we preserve it with some more active, purification or quantum air mitigation routines. K. So I'll end with some some open questions that, that we came up with. So This really led us to, you know, a lot more work we can do on this. And, yeah, I'd love your input and and where we should take this next. So you know, you know, what is the optimal topology for a given network and what is the optimal use of that topology? The routing schemes for 2nd and third repeaters will be quite different than the 1st generation. So especially 3rd generation repeaters or what are called one way repeaters, this becomes a lot more like a classical network. It's a transport network. You're quantum information is is flowing. You know, uni directionally across the path, instead of this 1st generation where we have this this, entanglement swapping and kind of stitching together this these these local entanglements Think the biggest one for me is this number 3. How coupled should the the routing and forwarding the I think, you know, the best routing algorithm should take into account all of this stuff should take into account swapping schedules. It should take into account verification, so not just considering the link metrics just based on, you know, the entanglement probabilities but rather"

Some papers did couple them. Others did not. But I think that's an interesting open question we can consider. Data plane overhead analysis. So all these protocols come with, certain data plan overhead in terms of communication that's that's necessary. This adds late to the whole process. So, more kind of complexity analysis into the data plane overhead is is, another future direction, As I mentioned, failure recovery is something that we found some lacking in, in literature. So, you need to to study that more robustly. And then consider, you know, more heterogeneous network we have different links and different hardware capabilities. This makes the, the problem more interesting. Great. So with that, I'll end.

So this is an example of a quantum network design. I'm not here to talk about the bigger of a quantum network architecture, but what we wanna do here is Our group has been thinking a lot on how we can divide or identify different layers in quantum network, and we thought is a good start to think of the different timing regimes of different components in a quantum network. And I wanna show here on this slide is that they're just a different a lot of different components, and we have to think of each layer, like the hardware or the quantum side. Okay. So in a quantum network that distributes end to end entanglement, there are a number of tasks with demands on time and precision or jitter And some of these can only be,"

And detailed analysis or research on these timing of genes, we believe that will be affect the core of design of quantum network nodes. So here's a list of the time regime that we propose on our document, and we can actually group these up into 3 groups. So the first group would be the quantum optical path This is where the quantum mechanics happen, quantum optics, So from when we emit the photons to when we detect them and collapse them back into classical And the second grouping would be hardware. So, like, detectors or optical switches or what we use to Change the measurement basis, And the third one will be software. So I believe a lot of people here are engineers, so we'll focusing more on the first part, which is quantum optics, and go through, the hardware and the software briefly. So to give everyone a bit of an introduction, I think what we use in quantum networks, we use photons to communicate or to entangle links with each other. And Here, everyone might know what a photon is, but I often think people believe that photons are, like, a particle or either wave but in our, team or our group, we often think of photons as a wave packet. So a single photon could be described as a wave packet And we all know that light is an electromagnetic wave. So what we're describing here is this is the amplitude of the field of a single photon. And, yeah, So this is what we consider a single photon, and this is what we call the wave packet. So to look in more to this, let's say one oscillation here is The wavelength and one oscillation is 1.5 micrometers. So this is, like, 56 nanometers, and this is what we use in optical fibers. So for classical fiber, even for classical communication, we still use 15, 16 nanometer"

But So the point 5 micrometers can be converted into 200 telehertz in frequency, and that is for one oscillation, it'll take about 5 times ten to the power of minus 15 seconds which is the range of femtoseconds. So it's, make sure it And when we outline this, wave packet, we can say this. We call this the envelope, so it's like the shape of the wave packet. And when we think of how we want to interfere the 2 photons to achieve in tango and swapping, which is how we, link together 2 nodes in a quantum network we have to think of how these interfere together. So we wanna achieve the right the same frequencies or the same the same shape of these wave packets. So a bit more on the wave packets, So I talked about oscillation time could be, like, a femtosecond. Range, but it differs on the technology that we use to emit photons in a quantum experiment. Of how many oscillations we have in a single wave packet. So it could be tens to trillions times the wavelength, and that will correspond to the duration time of a wave packet to be picoseconds to microseconds long And if we convert that into length, a single photon could be up to, like, kilometers or it just be like a micron in length. So talking a bit more on these wave packets, there are two examples here with the same wavelength, but different envelopes. So thanks, Euphoria, and Hi, Zimbra. We know that, wave packets with short envelopes have high uncertainty in wavelength because there are just many more, super positions of the waves in one packet Yeah. This is just the same picture that describes in a different way. Okay. So getting right back to the timing regimes, The first one is an interferometric stabilization. So in tangent distribution in quantum networks is what we wanna do, basically, and it's performed by an entanglement swapping."

    "text": "Intanglement swapping, what has to be satisfied for entanglement swapping is the 2 photons have to be vote when we interfere them at a beam splitter. And the properties that can determine how distinguish photons are could be polarization, spectrum modes, and other stuff. Here we can see figure here is showing 2, different wave packets. So If the wave packets don't aren't, identical, they won't interfere. They were distracted destructively interfere, and we can't see, in time when swapping. So we want to achieve the same properties. You want the photons to be and that is purely on quantumoptics. So It's not so much that we can engineer them in, like, software, but We also what we can we want to do, another component that we have to do is we have to overlap the photons So we don't want them to be distinguishable. We want them to be indistinguishable where we also have to think of signing of the photons. So if the photons don't overlap with each other, we can also distinguish one from 1 like, one can come first and one can come second. That means they're not identical. They're not the same. So that is not good in the sense of swapping. And factors that can lead to wave packets to not overlap is photo and mission time jitter, which is just pure physical stuff. We can't really fix it. And physical distance difference between each nose is something that we can fix. So to give more on insight on this, so the two photons at the to have to arrive at this box, which is the bean splitter, And if they arrive at the same time, they'll give good visibility, which corresponds to good entanglement, basically, in a quantum network. And so these blue things are the wave package I was talking about. And you can see here that They are the same distance apart from the bean splitter, which they will probably interfere at the same time because late The speed of light is constant. So for a bad overlap on the other hand, we can see here that The distance between the two wave packets are pretty far apart. And this case, they won't interfere with each other, and this will give poor visibility, which will not give us entanglement."

    "text": "One thing that we can do to fix this in the practical sense is we can use an optical delay line It's a device that has two mirrors inside of a box, and you can just, like, adjust the mirrors. With, like, signals. We can connect it to a Raspberry and just, like, send move a bit to the left or right. And this is actually what I work on more more of the time, but we, we have to consider when we're using this hardware is the time to calculate the delay needed force, for it seeing interference at the bean spitter. And we also have calculate the time necessary to, talk to the optical delay line and also the time to set and reset the optical delay line. For the future use. Okay. So moving on to the hardware part, I'm just gonna go through these, ladder parts quickly, but detector timing windows our, our 3rd aspect in the timing regimes. And for an ideal single photon detector, we often call call SPD is it it will generate an electrical signal after absorbing photon and only after observing a photon. But that's just the ideal case in the real world, what's gonna happen is we're gonna have timing jitter or dark count rates and that will affect the overall rate in entanglement distribution in a quantum network. So and that's kinda on the hardware side, so there's not really much can do, but we also have to take in account of the timing that or the reduce in the efficiency in the network and we design the quantum network, we have to think of these parts. And another thing that we can help or fix in this sense is the recovery time. So once one photon is, is absorbed in a single photo detector, and it generating electrical signal. We have a time to wait for the next photon to be, absorb. So we can't just, like, send we have to think of the intervals between 2 wave packets. That's also one thing we have to consider during designing a quantum network. Okay. So we're talking on measurement basis selection. We need to monitor the quality of entanglement quantum network. And for instance, let's say we have, like, a 1000 bell pairs and we can use"

And to do that, we have to change the measurement basis. So how we do that, it this is also related hardware. We use wave plates, which is optical component, but that is connecting to, like, a motor, and we said signals to that motor to rotate the wave plate. So we can measure in different bases, basically. And shifting that wave plate, obviously, does take time. So We have to also take in account the timing of shifting the way plates An optical switch control. I believe a lot of people here know what a switch is. So, basically, it is switching where the photons go as, like, in any kind of network But what we have to consider here is not just the time of how long it takes to switch from one path to another, but we also have to take in account of the interval time triple time, the time again of when the photons, how much time they are between 2 wave packets. So think of a train photon wave packet as a train. And, like, when you wanna switch the tracks, you can't just switch midway through train or it's gonna break. So something like that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. So from this part, it's gonna be on more on software. And this part is a lot on work in progress. The document is not completed I'm just gonna go through the brief idea So pre, configured event driven task could be so when something goes wrong the networks. It's like a backup that the software can help you, but sometimes might not work, and we're not quite sure on on this part yet. So we're still, under investigation. And for gurgent but not synchronizing critical tasks, this doesn't necessarily, mess with entanglement in the whole, quantum network, but it is more something on the software side. So software does also take time and it's here to make sure that a software we need which is a big part of the network that works properly So moving on to the next software as host site application level task,"

And we can categorize these phases into initiation tasks and processing tasks and cleanup tasks. And each component will take a fair amount of time. So one, some components could be instantaneous but others will have to wait for, like, the quantum parts of it network, and we still don't have enough resources or the quantum experience set up yet to monitor all of these, but we have to think of these when we're actually designing a network. And last but not least, for the background task, the quantum parts in a quantum network can be scheduled to, run during the low periods of traffic in a network Since once we run the quantum, applications or the quantum parts of the network, we have strict timing restrictions for the quantum to work. And the the support in classical calculations can happen in the time that we're not working too much on the quantum side. It can run-in the back. So it doesn't directly affect like, the quantum side timing, but we have to fit take in account when this fits in or One is the low traffic to run these background tasks. Like, that could be link monitoring of the quantum particles or routing and other components. Okay. So this is still a work in progress and a timing regime in quantum network document. Actually, the real one has, like, a lot of equations in it. So we're still not sure which venue we wanna publish it at yet. But it'll be available to the public very soon. And to give an overview or recap, or summary of what how much time actually it might take or the range of timing just to give you idea. This is not a sealed deal at all. We're still, under research. We need to do experiments to actually know the timing of how much a quantum part could take. These are the parts we have to consider, and this is the brief ID up, of how much time each component would take.

Any questions, comments, we do have several minutes. Hi, Chris Delacio. So it seems to me that this kind of work lends itself to, like, a limit study. Where you can kind of understand What parts of the system are physically limited? So, like, you know, let's say you have an ideal fiber. And therefore, you know what your gloss is gonna be in the fiber. And so then you can look at all the other parts of the system if you what's the bottleneck? And you can keep doing that across all the different components of the system. Gives you the engineering guide of this is the part that can get the most gain on today. And move through it is Is that, like, the end goal of this kind of work. From what I know from this work, I believe that we wanna identify how we can actually structure, like, the layers, different layers. So it's not necessarily the end goal, but it's is, in my sense, a start because we from after you have an idea of how we can structure the network, then we actually have more technology or, like, better components that suit our network can probably work from that. Or my professor can also answer to that. Yeah. So, Monet presented the work, but, 3 of the 4 other people who are working on this document are here in the room, including me. So I guess it's okay for us to actually contribute to the answers here. The, part of what we're trying to do with this is, to define the constraints that will help us define layering in the system as as we're doing it. And so we can define what responsibilities what, what parts of the system are the responsibilities of the, the quantum optical engineers, the classical optical engineers, the the the the classical hardware engineers."

And then at the other end, there are requirements that are imposed by, by, you know, what, what the system has to do and actually to order, do something useful. So those would be, you know, sort of business level requirements. And, the document clean up on on regularizing that, that set of vocabulary.

Right? Oh, yeah. So do those message, these are in a classical channel. So this is for full management."

    "text": "Exactly. So so the the assumes that there is a classical channel that is a created with the, with the internal participation. And second thing, That doesn't imply, but because you're not considering the resources inside the repeaters. Yes. The resource, inside repeaters. Yeah. So those attributes are in inside repeaters. And, so here, this protocol is for link level protocol And, now So this link location, After this 4, link between node 2 and node 3 and, no, between node 3 and the 4, another link allocation update We rang No. Yep. What the what was the whole well, having mind is the situations that happened right now in in current routers, that you may have that the queues got, got full, and then you start dropping packets. Will be a similar situation here, right, if the repeater has no resources for for dealing with so many or the difference Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. So the In that case, The link allocation protocol or maybe the responder has to think about, oh, okay. Now, it's too much. Request. I'm I'm I'm finally, I guess that this is part as well of that. I'll let me inject just one comment there. So this the link allocation update and barrier This is mechanism and policy will be different Okay. And, you know, the policy mechanism will be a separate mechanism. you know, And so the, dealing with congestion or competing, requests or something like that. Your, call admission policy and things like that. That would build on top of this. This is just the mechanism for actual for actually okay and implementing those. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So now here, we just, use,"

Time interval to consider. Yeah. Mhmm. K. Other questions, comments, Everyone? Throwing once. Going Joyce, stopping slides, Okay. Thank you. Let's see. So that's all of the, main agenda items, for today. Thanks for your time. Okay. No. Sorry. I spoke to tell one thing. So our specification, is open. So, I mean, you can find, I like you to have interface. Maybe you should share the URL either in the chat or on the QIRG mailing list. Oh, yeah. Sure. I will. Let's see So we are done with, with the primary agenda. We have a few for any other business, anybody want to bring anything up? Particular, my co chair has been very quiet, so far, Wojtek. Any comments announcements, announcements, no. Not really for me. Just that talked super interesting, and I enjoyed the session today. There'll be a question on the mailing list, when will be the next meeting? I believe the next one's in North America, and only the next one after that is back in Europe Yeah. So Vancouver and Dublin are, July November And Wojtek and I have not yet actually sat down and talked about when we actually want to do the next QIRG meeting. Wojtek, you wanna meet in Vancouver, blah, blah, Dublin or both? At"

    "text": "No. North America is unlikely for me, but Dublin sounds, pretty reasonable. And I and I like using the European meetings to also engage the European ACI folks because they are developing a lot of protocol level research stuff and deployment, experience that would be valuable to bring to the RG. And it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it's a 2 hour plane flight for you instead of 12. It does help. The, usually for me, the the the July meeting conflicts with, the end of semester, but this year, it's actually scheduled reasonably. So I so I may actually be able to show up in Vancouver, but no commitments yet, but but, Dublin sounds pretty good to me. So likely the next face to face QIRG meeting likely will be double it. Pay attention on on the mailing list. Any other comments? Anybody? Any final questions? To any of the speakers or any other announcements or business. If not, we are done and I will give you back your, 7 minutes Thank you all. Thank you very much, Doctor Ron Whitemeter. It was a great, cheering Thanks. Glad to hear it. Alright. We have 7 minutes is there anything that we can talk"
