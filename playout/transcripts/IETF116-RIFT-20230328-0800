And then the sc there was a bunch of constant So we basically killed the constant appendix and everything went into sc, mean tie Id next It was well it was specified, but it was basically all over spec partially in a appendix so when he An important norma change was that We didn't need specify what happens if a v before forwarding is supported on the interface precisely what is supposed to happen on the lies when you send that. So that has been clarified that you must set the Ip for forwarding cable and devices it you're sending out? And it wasn't clear that give you the receive time with an un undefined level.

You tear down the Ct p dead way or you can actually derive things like me cabling even if the level is undefined. Okay. Next one. Alright. Couple of clarification Yeah. There was good catch by all.

Because the stuff sends a lot of things and it's says well allows you to do all kind of knee cabling detection. It doesn't really say what the me scheduling detection are. Right? Like the queue is kind of clear, but this spec is not norma in any sense like you must look at this and say or it doesn't that up. Like, you know, instance or you know, instance Id in there, things like that. Which are very helpful in deployment, but they are not norma because it's optional whether they implement a staff and you can implement know clauses that losing the staff. So let's say here's here's a simple example. If you have, you know, the subnet checking on both sides, which is very common Iso I protocols will do it. It's a very important thing. But you... There are lots of cases where the subnet don't match and you're still forward. So you need to know losing this clause. You cannot really make it norma. You have to start to dance all around this these things. And kind of the discussion went back and forth and those things belong in applicability draft. Right? Like, how do you deploy the stuff? No deployment guide. Because those are like the use of should you use one or two fifty five? There's a pro for both. Right? The two fifty five spec is kind of like two fifty five is the best. But, you know, lot of the stuff is being done on one because you cannot lose it and just specialist a Multi the stuff runs away from you. So that's the feedback to the applicability drives authors. That we need to cover that stuff and put it in. Right? So it's a partially a mild implementation guide and the deployment guide as well. So Jordan with poke key, Jordan is actually on the flight.

Right? And you have to watch that. If both of them are advertising, know, different values. Ultimately tie breaking, make sure that everybody on the needs, you know, sees one of the values, but the value is based ti open based on the on the base back. So or what we found. That you need some kind of debugging. Right? And for the debugging way through a well known key type, which has no other purpose, but basically per down and everybody can advertise that at every place in the Fabric. You can go and look what's it probably ty broke and did he choose the proper guy. Right? So it's next one. It's a relatively simple thing. Mh. It's it basically has a system id level because that's how we tie break on And with that, it's it's very helpful. In the sense that you see whether the notes are at the right level with the software down. And you see what the tie breaking was correct, because this thing runs on the same key. Right? The sound voluntary tie brake, well known key. So everybody advertise the same key at the bottom you look... Is tie breaking. Correct. It correct guy win. And that's that's very helpful.

So to check you know, to to to to find split brains we would have to reflect the Sound bound key jacob just like we reflect the note ties.
