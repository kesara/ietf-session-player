We did an adoption call, I think, couple of months ago and reached consensus adopted those working group docs. So they are now Tagris talks, and we'll continue working on them at rating on them, refining them, and then ultimately move to the next steps. And then Come on, Roman. And then we'll move on to discussions with authors With that, we do need a minute taker is there anybody who would like to help? Please go to the notepad tool. I know Leaf will be taking some notes. If there is anybody else who can please help fill in the details, it would be very helpful. It would be very helpful. Oh, oh, Thank you so much. Take it to work. Wonderful. Thank you. Appreciate it.

And it seemed like Are those coming from the same conceptual model of what's going on, or do we have place where those conflict do you have something in mind how they would conflict or Alright. It seems as though there there's a a requirement that the sender and their shaver don't need to be there at the same time. But we also want to not necessarily be able to to tie them together or or do anything else. I I think it's or the intention there is we don't wanna be able to correlate a sender or a receiver across various sends and receives.

So it might be a good time to revisit that solution. So it gets a fair shot. And the second solution or other second approach that was suggested to us in this working group was using WebDow. So when we heard web hour, rather when we talk to people about web browsers, reactions are really as an interesting I was like, what is WebDow? Or is it still alive? I mean, isn't GMAP replacing it? to really is we've done the right solution for this. but we don't want to this must be wiped out just because of those reactions. We want to give it a fair shot. So we did that The idea is that what if we take a off the shelf dev server and try to build progress with it. How would that look like? So next slide, please. So we tried to for for off the shelf web down solution against our requirements, and how does it go? As you can see, it meets about 7 out of 10 requirements with minor tweaks. So a solution with WebDavis possible achievable but there are some things that need a deeper dive. And I want to bring that up to this room here so that we can use this collective brainpower to perhaps come up with some solutions that can actually work. So if you have any questions, do feel free to enter and asked Next slide, please. And oh, yeah. There are also considerations that are in that requirements document and There are a couple of considerations where it was not very clear how WebDA would would meet those.

So Does anyone how questions about what this round trip requirement is or our relates to credential transfer at all. Sure. I'll I'll summarize it. So I guess the idea is that, say, Alice wants to transfer a credential to Bob. and the type of credential, the protocol requires proud tips. So Alice will send message 1 to Bob, Bob sends message to m 22 back to Alice. Alice sends a message m3 back to Bob, and then Bob has enough information to get the credential. That is the round trip requirement. So when trying to solve this problem with WebDow. There are there is a question. How is this stone taking going to work? Like, does Alice create a web dev resource somewhere And does Bob modify that same resource to send that m 2 back? or does Bob create a new resources And if Bob creates a new resource, how does Alice know about that resources Because to to quote, WebRFC, any resort web dev resource that's out there is readable to all the participants on the Internet. So can we really make it writable so Bob can write into it? I think that's a question for, I guess, the working group. If you have suggestions on how to solve this problem, so that we can actually implement down trips. That would be really, really useful. Erica Skorla. I mean so I thought that this problem about 30 seconds. So But I think I'd actually maybe, like, step back from this for a tiny bit and Brad feel free to jump into me if if you if you want. But, like, you know, I have some thoughts about technically most suitable, but, like, my experience has been that what's most suitable is what the people in the working wanna do. and and then these just wanna do.

So, yes, it is a loaded term In this case, the way we are using it is that credential is Oh, a set of cryptographic tools along with some metadata. that lets you have access to some property. So that could be your car. That could be your house, hotel room, So it does include some cryptographic key, so it could be a asymmetric key, asymmetric key, whichever way they designed it. and some metadata. Like, how do you use that key? Do I just print a solution to a challenge on a paper and let them scan it, Or do I use some radio technology? Do I use NFC? Do I use you would have to be Wi Fi something. Right? There has to be some metadata about how to transmit are talk to the reader.

So, like, great. Let's put it in spots and and Keep going. Oh, Right. I'm I'm here not as the chair. Right? But I wanted to comment on what you're saying. And let me see if I can reinterpret what you were saying. Right? Yeah. both of the Erics, I think. So that the what put the Eric's we're talking about is essentially operational consideration."

You can write down those things as an operational or consideration for the protocol, right? It doesn't necessarily mean that you need change the web app protocol in in order to make make it work. Right? it's essentially a profile. And so other standards for these people regularly talk about profiling. stand much when they do this. Right? I think that's what we're talking about. And it it's not I don't think it should be considered a problem for web dev if you have to profile it. Right? you have to if you have set it up in a certain way to make it work. So Thank you, Lee, and Eric for that. I mean so Just to clarify that, we are new to this standard making process. we are going to make some mistakes and Thank you for understanding that and helping us understand the process as well. The yes. So what what we are trying to identify here is that we have those 10 requirements that we have adopted. and What are the requirements that are not that will need more work? So I think it would be a good idea to go to mailing list to figure out What can we do to achieve those goals. Right? I mean, this is one of that requirements that needs more work. And so is the next one. If we could go to the next slide, The connection integrity requirement is also another requirement that is going to need more work if we are thinking of using WebDAR as a solution. In this the the I don't know if people are clear about what connection integrity requirement is, but I can quickly summarize that. In that same example of Alison Bob exchanging messages M1M2M3, We want to make sure that it is actually Alice and Bob that are going through the entire sequence. and somebody Charlie is not injecting the message into are deleting the message into or something like that. There's that yeah. We want to make sure that the interaction happens between those two parties once it started."

So, again, trying to be unwise, we spent for amount of time, reviewing the web box specification. And we just found areas we don't have an answer for. and we have our doubts how those areas can be covered. by web dev. And here we are basically the non tagulation, So the original idea that the intermediate server, which serves to clients doesn't collect the identities, doesn't store any PI data, etcetera. and Just reading the back of a charted document. It's distributed document authoring or resource authoring. And authoring means some identity probably. well. Well, well, at least maybe the author name. Right? So It's inherent into the charter dock it's inherent to the protocol. That's again my personal opinion. which I got after reading the specification and the chartered doc. So And particularly that DAF specification mentions the Authorization between client and server mtellusandprobablybydigest So some form of authentication. and and Again, I'm not claim to be a security expert. But in my opinion, authentication means some form of identity shared between client and server. And I find problem here, how having that identity server would not store or use that. soup,"

And I'm I don't I didn't I wasn't quite following the whole, like, where web dev came from this, but it sounds like you're pointing out a lot of problems with webdev, I think that's probably accurate because it wasn't created with these constraints in mind.

What does it stop me from reading the message, Lisa? Brad from reading the message, Lisa, back to me. Okay. So going back to my original proposal, which we presented a year ago, we proposed a lock in mechanism which, like, sense a unique identifier and that unique identifier is presented by 2 devices. and the server verifies the raw like 2 devices which are being So they share a secret key. It's not a secret key. They don't share anything. each one present their own unique Block. It's a case. Yes. It's some random number. And server collects, collects, 12 and says, that's enough. no more quality is coming. So if if I may add, they don't share the key. So you have your own key Leaf will have his own key. and the server knows both of them, And Sir server is going to only allow leaf to read and write from that point after the first come first. Right? That's the idea. So you sent the first message, that invitation to leave, Yes. Leaf has now this token to go to the server to retry that. And as part of that retrieval process, Beef is going to put a lock on that that I'm the only receiver And if later, Yogesh or Brad tried to come in to read this, don't allow that. That's awesome.

And then another party is coming with different token, and cervical acts a second token says We have Sorry. The the initial sender generates a random token and gives it to the server. yeah, the initial sender generates a token and puts it into a mailbox. at the time of creation. Okay? And then server that enforces that that mailbox can only be read by somebody token or apparently the second token. the the the server expects the second device to come and present a token, whichever token there is. as long as token exists, it locks these two together, we call it device claim. in the original proposal. So, like, I mean, this is, like, I mean, that sentence won't work.

Eric, if you have better proposal, please least -- Okay. I I do because it's actually quite well known. I mean, I'm sure there are various ways to do the same thing. Right? I mean, that's not uncommon. what we proposed there is I mean, there is a draft link somewhere of the original audit that the thing was proposed. It's called device claim. Now I I idea simple that as a sender, I create this mailbox, and I have a token that Let's server know that. If I'm talking to it, I will use that token. And the first person who's going to retry something from that mailbox well, they're using the mailbox ID to identify that resource. they will also put a token of their own on the server So now that's creating in a essentially a connection.
