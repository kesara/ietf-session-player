So it is just a problem statement recap. When we have D le today, it is my default based on seven four three two. It is per es per eva. So in this case, if you have multi deployment where you may have huge amount of flows which are coming towards the access side. All the traffic is going to come from one p. And that may kind of add extra load in case of any failure all the flows have to move around the p's, and that may cause some extra convergence issues. And that is where we came up with the new scheme of d for multi traffic. We can go to the next So with new scheme of d procedure. What we are trying to do, we are trying to differentiate between cost and unknown cost with multi cost. So broadcast and unknown cost remains as is the way it is today, and only for cast by default, you could be in the block state. And we do d as and when we get a join. So if we are having multi homing peer, we are anyway using P gdpr multi sync procedures. So when one of the p is getting joined, anyway, join is going to other side as well, and that is the time when we are doing the d alexa. And we are using R w"

In the latest version three, we've updated the section on the Mac mobility to clarify the procedures of map mobility. In single active mode, in this gateway portal of single mode.

This version five addresses several comments we received on the draft on the document. To incorporate ultra procedures for other low balancing modes. So previously, it included only all active and single active. But based on feedback we received, we realized that effectively, this should apply across the board to others like single proactive and port active. So those are added explicitly into the document. And more importantly, in this in this version five, we have extended sections for the support of New delays. So V lan Tunnels and S sr six support is added also. So the procedures for avi six are defined.

So this argument is effectively the per E per Es, destination of the reroute, which specifically on a reroute packet, which ac or which Es sub interface two target? The reason this was was done this way is because the advertisement of this reroute or the resulting Ip six address of this reroute makes no change in Ig. Do not need to advertise this anywhere other than in Bg. And the the only change locally is the inclusion of a new forwarding behavior in the fit, which would note that it has to implement the the behavior is defined further up in this in this document for the terminal this position and Loop avoidance. Sorry. Loop avoidance and D f bypass. So as I mentioned, we have implementations of this document in Cisco Ios xr.

So D p database based based on the Dhcp messages, which is popular called as do. Discover offer request an ag messages in this particular top, you know, the client is behind the switch one and Dac is behind the switch.

So this is the new route type that we are defining this more or less, you know, looks like a type two out without the the labels. Since dear the binding is, just no binding is mac and Ip. Then there is also an lease time, which the server allocate so that you know, if the host doesn't do the renewal within certain point of time then this entry is going to be remote and we are going to meet use of the same thing. For for the E vpn and I have a slide for the feature explains this. Okay. So so how is this Dhcp is getting origin. Right? So this will be originated by the Pe you know, where the host is connected, which does the the door exchange.

As I explained, you know the lease time is needed as a mechanism in which if host does not do the the renewal and that to be removed when the Dhcp new properties is advertised in the fabric.

So it it can maintain a time stamp what time the Dhcp snoop is received. And while this no problem to the peers. It can calculate it can get the current time, and it can, you know, subtract that advertisement time. With the time the route was received. Minus the the least time it as is. Right?

And so it is the responsibility of the sending the the Bt speaker to the appropriate week's time. Yeah. So we will look into the bridge service and followed by dia survey. So as we said one of the requirement is to, you know, support the multi homing. So in this Sample top, we have a Dac client or sitting between behind the b two b three, which I a multi home.

In this case, the prefix Prefix attribute is there one of the key things is that it indicates the use of Sr. Encapsulation. Right? So that's the reason why it's there.

And there is another suggested solution, which is based on their we call E vpn instance rather solution. That's for the mass we draw of procedures for alias backup those are supported by the solution as described Rf eighty three sixty five section ten two. So basically, the the only caveat here is that again, English pe for the non zero Es mac and has to resolve that with a receiving eighty per route from the Same p Right?

Now for this horizon filtering, it has an impact And again, if you go back to the this diagram, suppose you have a t one and p two, multi to the same c and they are attached to different domains. Right? So there are two possibilities you either use an Si based speaker rise on filtering? Or you use local bias, right? Depending on the transport? So if you use the the former one, So is I based as Verizon? Again, you you need to correlate it. I met routes with received eighty various routes to find the Es label. So in order to do that, you need to go back to the method in section three one of the this document. Or an easy solution is you can use domain wide common block same Es labels for all ips attached to the same. Segment.

Any customer locator may be maybe advertising in Ig, but below maybe maybe in scenarios. Maybe not as loader. So we can't get a... The service is or customer. But why is that indication required in in Bg I need to want to give time for area We need to take time of. Maybe you can explain on the... I can ask on the list as well. Yes. Thanks. Okay.

Or is single the locator? Yeah. That's that's one comment. And and even for layer three, when are you solve it if you use an n x four or six behavior. And then basically, you you solve that the loops situation. Right? You can you can go to a p three then and go to p four and p four will always send to this c or drop the traffic. So I don't understand why you need a new bypass. Service for this. I was think more and yeah to replace appreciate. Very very fast. I'll. Thank you for this presentation. I think it's addressing a problem a common problem. Maybe we can discuss after because there's there's two issues that I see in in this proposal. The first one is you're installing a backup backup pass only on the active pointing to the backup? But based on the the bypass service said you just... You decide not to install the backup from the backup path of the main path. Is that correct? And we can talk offline? Yes. The second question is When you do the reroute from p three to p four, in E and if it's an two service, you do have the problem that the p four to to c three link could be d non elected. So the traffic arriving at p four will get blocked and and dropped before control plane has time to readjust. Yeah. So I would like actually, after after the session, we can discuss it. Outside. Yeah. Six. Yep. You. Thanks it. Next speaker you."

Firstly, let's have a brief recap about this draft. Previously, we proposed our procedure and the Extension to perform the app upstream ingress side designated for selection So at each roots Pe, the primary and standby by the can be allowed consistently. And we also introduced an Checklist mechanism so that when the failure occurs the Monica traffic can be received on the eve leaf Pe from the backup tunnel quickly. And we also introduced about the B Session established to between the primary as done by pe so that the failure can be detected quickly And this time, I will mainly introduce about the rest part of our draft and our update on those questions mentioned in the mail next I please. So firstly, this is updates about the question that the difference between our draft and I've c twenty six. So this time we update it as when the Received the sigma multi cost to route from the leaf p, it will only forward this c p joint towards high network if it is a primary or stand idea. So in this way, only the primary and stand idea will receive the multi traffic. And therefore when the failure occurs"

So as you can see from the top of the figure. There are only two key fields which is the Rd d and the Ip prefix of the U edge route. Therefore, when the R are configured same at different Pe the I should send by them will be sent from perspective of liberty But our premise of the procedure was that we need this thing to p just take distinguish already on different pe. Therefore, we propose a new formats of the Route. And knew that truth will just carry the Ip address as a key field. So that the leaf will just process different route. And the new Route will be changed among those Marty Hu Pe. And it has higher priorities and existing your. So next slide, please. Here we discuss about the non Ai scenario. So as we all know, there is a problem that's a four Oc tab source Field cannot hold the sixteen tart six address. And it will out that it is hard to between Tuesday maori cars the roots In the seat as group granularity. So our solution is to use the registering ratio extending the community, and will carry it in with the intra as, Ad road or card Sp eighty roots.

I hear we talk about the root x implicit tracking function in the segmented scenario. In the segmented scenario, different intra As a will be getting into an inter Route and the origin Ips information will be discarded. And the leaf will not be able to distinguish the multi cost of traffic from different route rupees So we propose the two solutions. The first solution is to use the white how sp eighty proposed five six t six twenty five. And it mentions that the Sp a route will not be aggregated at As. Second solution is to use the pe distinguish labels attribute to proposed ink. I have sixty five fourteen. And the p label will be assigned at the As for different routes pe. So they will be carried with the inter As route at Airs point. Where cars the traffic arrives at the ears they are, they will they will they will be processed. So that's the labor designed previously will be adding into its labels stack as an in label. In this way, the lift recognize the source of the multi cost traffic and the Rp checklist can be performed accordingly. So seconds slide Next slide, please. So finally, we just update a back up"

And we also mentioned about a solution to the problem that Leaf p may choose different route p. And as you can see in the figure, there are three conditions the top the top leaves a pe it is it supports the Idea reduction, but it's took did not access it to the idea primary, so it cannot receive traffic from the primary p. So the peanut tunnel world just so wrote back to the normal p. And the middle street left p support and the all connecting to both primary as then by Ideas. So both the warm primary and backup are established to here. But only the primary Treat is used to further traffic. And at a bottom of the figure, leaf he does not support the Id. So it was also up revert back to the normal t tree. Okay. Next slide, please. So as you can see, we have just evolved our draft Was searching, and we are looking forward to more we can group reviews and comments. And this time we would like to call for an adoption. Okay?
