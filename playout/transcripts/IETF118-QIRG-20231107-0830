Please use the on-site meet echo tool to, to, Ray to virtually raise your hand and say you want to, I'm, having a question. Remote participants, Yes. Same thing. If you raise your hand through through the tool, we can we can recognize you in order there. Alright. Next slide. So, for those of you who've been around for a while and also for the commerce. The the tools have been sort of shifting icons and shifting places and things like that. A little bit over the course of the last couple of ITFs. You'll see in the top there in the middle from the IETF, IETF agenda, Tuesday morning, first session. You will see a you will see the QIRG listed.

The last last talk is not the speaker pulled out, and we'll be speaking of the next session instead. And the 6 g session is 20 minutes Sorry about that. Just a brief up, update on the RG status that their current there's a one draft in process right now, and it's currently an ISG review. So we won't be hearing any update on that today. And before I hand over to the first speaker, I wanna make a single note, about the relevance of QKD to the QI IRG. So we often emphasize that the QR you must do, looking at beyond QKD applications of quantum entanglement. I do. My personal view is that it's, would be short sighted to not also look at the current today's QKD efforts. And the reason is as follows, Europe, since we were in the European session, Europe is building a quantum communications in structure today projects are underway and nodes are being deployed. For QKD Networks. And the physical layer, the technology is very different. Very different. They they both use fiber. They both send photons over the fiber. So There is all, actually. There are some similarities and some shared concerns of physical air, but the protocol the physical area are different. However, there might be quite a lot of synergies in the higher layers, especially in the control and management layers as well as many other layers that maybe I'm not really considering at the moment, but at least I, in my own work, I'm often involved in some QKD projects specifically with a view of looking how they will upgrade to entanglement networks. Important thing to remember is We want to build separate entanglement networks. They will evolve from the QKD Networks, the QCI networks we build today."

I have with Boire Tech in Oklahoma, right, on the on the idea that, some of the experiences that we have gained so far, we the QKD Networks, could be somehow applied in the, for planning the general quantum internet and try to get some, lessons that we have learned on how to associate it in the for the for further deployments of the of the development of the technology. As he, was mentioning before. It's true that the technology is that the The physical level are quite different but the kind of, of, architectural principles when when talking about control and management should be the same. And there are certain principles that should be applicable. In in in both cases, it's important that we gain some, some, insight from what has happened so far. Can you move on, please?"

Let me say some that, and try to apply the, principles that already have been Agreed. Propose in the in the community.

So it's able to adapt to the technology as it as it goes on. An example from QKD, is that the idea that, right now without physical quantum repeaters that you can deploy on the field joke, need to rely on on trusted notes and the ideas that you can move from just a note to to repeat this.

So we need to find a way to conquer a concatenate different links in the forward, a user key from one end to the other end, And for this, we are relying on those, key management systems retrieves the key from the Cranta links, looks for the key management, which is, okay, it's the key actually suitable for my needs and the forwarding of the secret which is encrypted. The bigger question, if you have such a big network. How to actually control the network. Yeah. You have multiple content links, and for this, we do mainly network management.

We just take the random numbers we have. But right now it's just a theoretical study and the assumptions that we're gonna start implementing this and testing this early next year. And what we show on the demo right now, it's called system emulator because, I think most of the people just don't have a quantum network in the basement. Play with, maybe some guys have, but get hands on for people trying through work with this, asking resource questions, and also what we try to get this and to hit the hands of computer science students quite fast to say, look, that's an emulator You can play with that one and the intentions also to have better link amylations in the over the time right now is set. It's just, quantum random numbers. There's no quantum below that. And, for us also, since we have a real network hopefully soon,"

Actually, you brought a very good point about the security of these devices. And that's one thing that we always look into. So especially with the lack of certification programs, etcetera, already running, how are you going to evaluate the real security of these devices, they have the actually, we 10 attacks that we know are possible. We don't know yet to be honest here. So we're looking at this, and it's it's giving us a bit of hard, headache because it's like you have a completely new link layer technology, you have all the regular headaches about security development testing and attestation. So and to know, we're just hacking and say it's safe, but it's not, but at think that's something is is is is will get through in the next year. When we come up, or this steeper in the beginning saying, okay. We have a fresh system. Can work with, and then we're going back to, and and then we can talk about this afterwards also offline.

So we come this 686 from a research group called Christy, we work on the theoretical foundations on Quantum Systems, it was a subset of the research directions we're coming out in parallel we're strongly focused on simulation of hybrid communication networks, We we research and investigate how to achieve high data rates, and and reliable communication using quantum resources such as entanglement, And last but not least, we work on content photography. In the next slides, you can see also, sublease of several projects we're involved in. Sheutov, is a project about on top end based authentication. And secure data storage. And it's actually part, part of of of of of of of of a bigger nationwide project called grant challenge of quantum communication who's called the development of of of of of quantum memories in collaboration with several other projects. We also work on curriculum nets in collaboration with Thud Reston, The main goal of telecom nets is building and using a quantum internet demonstrator with free notes, And last but not least, policy investigates the use of quantum technologies for physical layer service integration. Today, I mentioned specifically these free projects because the work that we did for them provide provide useful insights to the topics I will present today. Next, please.

We are, constrained with with with with with with basically on the physical side, So from quantum mechanics, we know that, we cannot measure an arbitrary state without altering it, And, probably most of you know, the no cloning theory, which means that we cannot copy an arbitrary state And this means we cannot do copy and retransmission as we used to in the classics case, And the cases in some applications, we don't even know what queue bid we want to send So, I mean, example, in PB84, UKD, we know it, but, for example, if we have a quantum money bill the owner of the bill doesn't even know what the Cubid they want to send. And sometimes even nobody knows the state, for example, for a quantum physical clonable functions. So cube path based content talking, for example, and and and On the one hand, this would, prevent the malicious cloning of, states But on the other hand, this means if we have a loss in the link then cannot do anything. Next slide please. Excellent. Exactly. So, now about what we have in the physical reality if we have a fiber, for example, we, have losses due to bending impurities splicing and the connections and so on, which lead to absorption scattering. But, even if we would have a perfectly straight fiber, which is, like, has no imperfection and stuff. We have intrinsic properties of the materials which leith us to have a option entered maybe implementation specific if this absorption may may may may may may may may may may may may may may may may be a problem or not, and affect loss.

So our next step is Other things, dispersion and broadening effects because we have a dispersion means we have a wavelength dependency of the propagation speed in reality, we don't have a perfectly narrow lined with, which means, due to thermal and intrinsic effects means that we have temporary broadening the effects, which means, also that, optical hardware, doesn't really is not really agnostic to this, let's say. And this can lead to the, degraded and distinguished ability of a photon, which means we cannot be sure that, quantum operation will succeed. Next slide is and also not only in the real link, but also in the from a flying to a, stationary Cubic, we have actually losses which may occur because, but those those are highly dependent implementation, but because this is, most of the time, light meta interaction you can most often describe it as a cavity quantum electrodynamics which, models is at the this, this, the stationary cube it as a 2 lever system in a resonator.

So with that in mind, let's talk a bit about cryptography. Thank Now cryptography on its own, a bit of a buzzword. It's a very broad field. So for sake of time, we will focus on some primitives. Today, we will focus on encryption and digital signature, identity authentication and 1 out of trouble is transfer. Perhaps this last primitive is a bit unknown and bizarre. So let's talk about it. In 1 out of job reviews transfer, Ellis, it's a stream to have 2 messages. I'm 0 and I'm 1. And Bob must choose one of them to receive. Now the underlying assumption is that Bob does not trust Alice and vice versa. Despite this, they want to achieve the following. They want to ensure that Alice is unable to guess Bob's choice. At the same time, they want to ensure that Bob only receives the chosen message and that only gains negligible information on the other one Now for each of this primitive, we will consider some photography proposals and analyze them in presence of message losses. Some some some some Please next slide. K? This is, public key cryptography creter scheme, using quantum public keys increase the classical message. They are combined, each encryption consumes quantum public key and transforms it into a quantum ciphertext. The letter is then sent to the receiver who can use his classical private key to decrypt it. Now, mostly, we will focus on the keeper generation because that is where vulnerabilities lie, You were provided an example using four bits numbers. So private key consists of 4 integers. That are just uniformly random. You don't turn them into angles by dividing by 2 to the power of the available beats, timespy."

What is important in this case is that the author himself specifies that if you have enough copies of the quantum public key, using some measurements, you can leak the private key. So they impose that only a limited number of copies should be distributed. But but but but please, next slide. Let's assume that losses are possible. And let's assume that some user claims that a quantum public key, a copy of the quantum public key was lost. Well, you can see what we prepared, 4 by 4 table in which we'll install the possible cases. Now, If you trust them, and and did believe that it was a loss due to noise and imperfections Well, if you're right, you can resend the key. And nothing really happens. But if you trust them and instead somebody intercepted the key, stolen, or maybe the user is cheating because they want more copies of the key. Then by which was meeting, you give them extra copies of the public key. And by repeating this over time, they can get enough copies of the public key to learn the private key So so leads to security threats. Now you can also be pessimistic and and always believe that somebody has intercepted the key. Well, if you're right, that's fine. Refuse your transmission successfully prevents an attack. But If you're wrong, and indeed, it was just some due to some fault, then by refusing to send the quantum public then, then, then, then, then, No, users, lost the key can no longer encrypt messages for you. And this will lead to, correctness violation. Please next slide. We found a similar problem in our digital signature scheme by Gaussman chunk. They also have, private key that is classical, and from that, they derive a country public key and they also impose that there should be limited copies. The quantum public key. Otherwise, you can leak corresponding private key."

Moving on to authentication, please consider this protocol. This is a simplified version of this authentication protocol by Hong etal. So it is assumed that Alison will pre share a classical key and they want to exchange cubits to verify that Alice's key. He goes, Bob's key. Now for this purpose, they predetermined a set of encoding rules. They encode 2 classical cubits, 2 classical beats into 1 cubits. S see in the example. Alison Cost this, bits in the cubits sends it to Bob. Bob takes a look at his key the rules and then measures in one basis, either the computational or the other more basis, And expect some result. For instance, in this case, you see that indication is not successful. Now, again, if somebody has multiple copies, of this cubit they can measure it. Several times, And then leak the corresponding private key bits. So Moving to the next slide, what should we do? If if somebody claims that the Cubic was lost. If Bob claims the Cubic was lost, Well, again, let's quickly go through the diagonal. If you assume a banning loss and you're right, That's fine. If you're pessimistic and you're right, that's fine. You avoid an attack. But if you assume a banning loss, and indeed somebody stole the qubit. Then the attackers came multiple copies of the queue bit over time and they can attack the protocol. Sorry. On the other hand, if you are pessimistic, but indeed, the qubit was lost to noise, then refusing to retransmit well, just not allowed Bob to verify Elesys identity causing a sort of denial of service. Finally, let's talk about, oblivious transfer. So We Please next slide. Okay? We will talk about the BBC protocol, which is one of the oldest and most established protocols for quantum of the transfer. Now without going into the details,"

Alice prepares random bits and cuts them into random mesas, sends them to Bob, and then Bob measures them in random basis. Now, of course, Bob will guess some basis, meaning that the the classical measure, the classical outcomes that he gets are sometimes equal to paralysis. Sometimes they're different. Or let's say, would 50% probability they're different you can see in the example, The rest is just classical post processing and classical communication. Now because, Bob, statistically will not guess all bases correctly. Is unable to learn both messages. But again, what happens if some messages lost. In the next slide, you can see again, prepared another table. Now let's just skip the diagonal because it's it's 5 trivial. So if Bob claims that a qubit was lost. And you trust him, which which is already weird because the assumption is that Alisson Bob do not trust each other, Let's assume you trust him. Well, by Richard's meeting, Bob gains multiple copies of the cubits using measurements, it can cheat. On the other end, if you don't trust but indeed the qubit was lost. Done well. You know, you the protocol cannot proceed. You cannot terminated. Fortunately, in this case, there is, simple mitigation. In fact, Bob claims that the qubit was lost Alice can just regenerate a random bit. Incode it in another random basis and send the qubit. And that is a simple mitigation usually, 6 can consider the net override of this negligible. And to some security. So we have presented a series of problems of threats, Now, can we mitigate them? In the next and final slide, you can see our proposal. So as explained, some protocols are inherently immune.

For instance, in this document that I'm sure the Kerogy Group knows really well. And we could follow this procedure Some models also suggested using the states the first proposed for 2KG by 1, 1 20 years ago now. And for instance, hung the author of the, authentication protocol that we mentioned proposals using these decoy states but they're not the silver bullet because work well against instructors, but active adversaries are still afraid they require some information on the channel, which is fine maybe for point to point, Links, links, links, but in a network that might not be the case. And and and and The main drawback is that they use a thresholding mechanism to prevent, let's say, lost 2 bit attacks, but what they do is if if the chubits number of lost cubits exceeds the the threshold, Bob just rejects the authentication. But the adversary has already stolen those cubits. So It's it's any way too late. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no And was all for today. Thanks and for listen, Alright.

I understand your question because also the first time I read that paper, I was a bit confused. Now they call it public key, because I guess you prepare multiple copies and you disseminate them but it's not a public key in the same in the classical sense. Classically, you have a public key. Share it with everybody. Everybody has access. You can copy an arbitrary high number of times. Here it's they call it public key, I guess, because you prepare several copies and share it with several parties In that sense, They call it public. Yeah. Sounds like both both the encryptor and the encryptor needs the private key, so it's not really public key. Whilst, Sorry.

What I'm saying is you have a quantum message, right? And you can exchange one to message it within an entangled network. Not now. But let's think that you have a quantum networks."

To me, at least for security, if you want to be here, you need to know who you're being secure with. Now if you're saying this is an idea, it might solve something We don't know what Okay. That what you're basically saying? I I I didn't hear you. Okay. Are you saying this is a an idea without a Okay. Tawatt you you and And and just take the opportunity to taking the opportunity to to say that this is one of the things that in the in the what I was presenting this idea of having separate, straton This is a problem for the quantum for loving stuff and and and make sense. Because it it, I mean, it it makes sense in the because you're you're trying to distribute entanglement. But then when what was called this was asking is how you relate it with, with the security properties that you have to to that you are not sharing information with a third party that you're not sure about. Presasily, the connection between the connectivity stratum and the, and the, and the, the quantum for working stratum, my view is that that's precisely what we have to discuss. I mean, I would take what, Marcellus has been presented, put it in the well, this is quantum for what I'm playing. Let's discuss how the addresses in the quantum forward in playing much with the the addresses in the connectivity plan because at the end, you would need physical connection, physical, classical connection as well. And you have to connect them and and make a relation among them and then you can derive some of the security properties Scott was asking for. And, So I think that most of the proposals are focusing on quantum another plane."

And the contrplain that we are developing right now in the test bed or with the simulators with the papers is medical class. Dance. That's Okay. Which is perfect fine. I mean, you have classical solutions for classical problems. Now, with them saying is that Personally, I'm very curious in investigating whether a quantum contra Dannen, can provide advantages over class fully And I fully agree, the my my point is that, the connection between because at the end, you need some kind of classical connectivity map to to to to, if Can can you go back to the to previous slide? You need a connect. Why do I mean, you need physical links. You need the fibers connecting one point to the other. Perfect. Can you stick go back to the Multipartian and tanglma. Yep. Here Okay. So For example, How do you define the classical connectivity once. I mean, you're saying that you you need to have a you need to have a classical version of quantum connectivity because at the end, you need to have quantum links interconnecting devices. And it's true. So I need to have a quantum link between this node and that node. And this can be easily mapped in a classical definition of connectivity. Naya. Yeah. Once have distributed EPR here and here, or here and here, whatever. And I start performing swapping the definition of connectivity changes in the sense that No. No. Another check into that. I agree with that."

What I'm saying is that the relationship of this quantum connectivity patterns and the physical the the underlying, you cannot call them physically. The underlying It's it's fibers connecting them you have to keep a relationship for preserving this, security properties that what's mentioning. I I am not objecting to what you're saying. It's it's trying to highlight that as well. You have to keep this don't know how to say these these, these, infrastructural roots I to to reason about the security, etcetera, only that. I agree. Okay. So Well, Yeah. Jun Voggin Choi. I'm sorry. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing your name right with Okay. Currently, IP address represents identity, ym, and locate where I am. At the same time, also the root, encoded in prefix. But in quantum case, it seems their location and connectivity seems more it, especially when entanglement came into being do you plan to use a different name for identity and location or connectivity, for quantum case, We didn't know yet. That's a honest answer. We're just starting to investigate what is, I mean, maybe the answer will be we don't need any quant madras and classical address are perfectly fine for doing everything that we need. So we are just starting to investigate let's suppose that I have a quantum address Is there any advantage? Of course, I need to convince a huge community which has been Block."

But what bother me personally is that High is possible that after 40 years of evolution, we cannot find a better way to solve addressing and route. This is something that bother me. I don't have the answer. On on how we can do. What I think still is that we need to start to investigate So we need to start searching, for new solutions to solve problem. I don't know if this makes sense. I mean, just comment. I mean, I when IP address was first designed, indicate both ID and locator. For content case, we'd better make it clear which For content case, one is Speak a little louder, speak closer to the mic. it may be better for us to indicate what we refer to identity or locator. So, Thank you. Shota. Hi. I am speaking. So, I'm not sure I'm free to understand what do you mean? But still I would define your distinction, between the, quantum IP address and, quantum routing table, the quartile IP address is we we we we That was a So let's say the destination is determined when, the measurement is you know, old cars. And, so might help the anonymous communication or I'm not sure if it's sealed. It may help as a a kind of quantum cloud computation that we cannot, you know, which node, actually, our computation is processed. I'm not sure yet. And, so as a seeing either content routing table.

So, yeah, that's could be a problem, but it might have some things Yeah. So is my last thing my understanding correct. Definitely. Definitely. If you start having quantum addresses, and you start having quantum routing tables, you need quantum algorithms to process those tables and to extract information. Now which kind of algorithm we'll provide you an advantage 0 Street funos. Still an open problem. How should we map identities within quantum address open problem. But think about in this way. Sir, there was this quantum amplification protocol. It was over there. And no one was finding a practical application of the one to map notification protocol, then sure came out and say, okay. We can use for this. So what what here we are advocating is that we need to have younger researchers and students trying to challenge current internet assumptions. And this is the only way to advance research in the same way that 50 years ago, order person, other researchers before us, challenge the circuit switching right, before there was this queuing theory, which has no practical value. And then there was all the IP and packet switching, framework. Mhmm. Now we have a new resource, quantum. How can we we use it for running the network."

I'm and professor and, head of the quantum group at the resident.

Next slide So you can see if we let's say zoom out, and we see or networks, paradig is, is going on at the moment. So we have on one side the design of the quantum internet And, in the case of Europe, we have the flagships the quantum internalize.

So we have numbers. We want this throughput. We wanted this end to end the latency. We want reduction of energy usage, moved to at least satisfy So for example, thinking about that we have been talking about QKD by now, So UKD provides, information theoretic secure, key distribution shown. But What is the cost in terms of energy? What is the throughput the key generation rate that we can achieve. So currently, the discussion in communication networks, embrace his various KPIs at the same time. So it's not like in the past that we want to only optimize throughput without considering, for example, latency or other metrics. And then we have also the difficulty of values So you see that now in 6 g, in respect of previous, networks, We have trustworthiness We have inclusion. We have sustainability.

So even this is problem because, a software, description of quantum network, is this, in quantum in classical software. So that means how, we model, in a accurate way, the the quantum, properties, the quantum behavior in classical software. And, also, you see there are architectural aspects like, scalability. That, connects somehow to the concept of sustainability. So sometimes, uh-uh, I saw some works that were, providing the idea of putting quantum computer per base station.
