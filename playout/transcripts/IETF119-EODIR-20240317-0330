So what did you press what's it showing on your screen, Karen? So that black is me. And I'm not sure why. So I'm going to stop sharing. And then start sharing again. You know, technology. It's you kinda just figure it out as you Is it still not showing? Yeah. Keep talking. Okay. So we'll wait for it to come up, but there are a couple other little buttons on the bottom. See? There's, sometimes it depends on your role. Sometimes only chairs see it, but you might see these three dots. There's some extra permissions that chairs have that participants don't have like locking the queue. Maybe there's not enough time in the session. And there's a a line of people at the microphones. They have to cut queue and don't allow any more people to enter. So that's something that chairs do in in monitoring the queue. Sometimes maybe they only wanna allow 2 minutes for questions. So you could potentially see a timer show up on the screen."

This right here will tell you if you wanted to leave the session. You'd press that button. So Don't leave us quite yet. Another thing to point out is that, let's say you're in a session and somebody just said something and you're like, I don't wanna forget to ask this person you know, a question or I'd really like to talk to this person after can do a direct message. So Who's in here on I guess it doesn't matter. You wanna Angela, right? Okay. So if you click if you hover over Angela, you'll see the little chat bubble right here. It looks like this. And if you click on that, Over here on the left hand side, you're gonna see so the public chat is the full group that we were in. And now Karen, on her screen shows AR for Angela, and she can have a direct chat just Angeles. So if somebody's talking about a draft, you have a question, you can direct message them and say, Hey. I'd really like to talk to you after I'm really interested in what you're doing. So that allows you to communicate with somebody directly with, just using the chat feature. And then if you want to close this particular chat, you just click on the little orange x right there? And that goes away, but the public chat can stay there.

There's not currently a way for you to add your picture yourself, We either pull it from the data tracker or something called gravatar. But if you want to add your picture, send a picture of you to support at ietf.org. And we'll be we'll be happy to add it for you. But These little icons right here kinda tell you how people have joined. So, Just an example, like, we have, Oops. Sorry. She's moving on around. So just looking, I'm trying to think. You see these little cell phone pictures right here? That means that you've joined using meet echo light. And then if you see the little house, right here that you that means you're using the full client And then if you just see a little chat bubble here, that means that this person is in the, chat room for Zulip. Actually. Oh, yeah. Okay. So, like, Jean, I know Jean. I work with Jean. She's not physically here in room, and she's not on the EODER session. I don't think she is but she's in the chat room for Zulip, and that's why she shows up there. Anup? Yeah. I you know what? I in all of my test sessions, I haven't seen that, Karen. Do you know what that is? Is it Anupa, are you here? Okay. So I believe that that I That one is the, I'm on the full client but I'm in the room. Whereas the other one means I'm on the full client.

I learned something new today. Yeah. We're we're constantly learning new things. So another thing to point out is you can see a little blue dot next to Karen's name over there. Just as we mentioned that on badges, we have dots, in the Mideka room, you'll see dots too. Karen is a working group chair for EODER. So she's got a blue dot up there. If you see a yellow dot or a red dot, you've got IAB or ISG members. So generally in a working group session, you're gonna have most likely at least 2 blue dots, which are your chairs. You're most likely gonna have an area director who's responsible for that area. In the chat room, And usually there's IAB members kind of sprinkled all over in the working group slash So that that'll be the, difference there. And if you hover over the blue dot, I believe it's this chair. Does it does it Can you show that share? Karen. Lalala. Sure. So it'll tell you what it means so you don't have to memorize that right away. Feel free to ask any questions. Alright. So, Jim, did you have a question? there. Yeah. Hi, Karen. Hi, Michelle. Oh, yeah. You're still So the question I have is this, assuming I have a patient in a working group. Assuming that I had already shared my material video for whatever it is with the chairs. And the moment I click as to share, I mean, as slides So it will pop up in the pre uploaded thing and you can just choose them and start presenting it Is that correct? So the"

And then, otherwise, you're asking to share your screen. And then it's whatever on your site. you're doing Correct. Sounds good. Right. So earlier when we went through the some of the that is already present in a PDF page, their screen sharing is generally not a recommended thing and instantly go for the other option as slides, which is where I should have already shared the material with the chair So I it will just showings in a small window where it shows a list of documents that are present and they just have to click that so that it gets popped up and they can start presenting it. So that was the option that I saw. So just wanted to confirm on this thing. Do you Karen as a chair, with having all the slides preloaded Do the chairs generally control them from your machine. For in person meeting, it it depends. But, yes, the chairs generally control them. Well, I mean, in person, we had this. Yeah. But as far as displaying it, it's through the, the working group. You might, who I, I don't remember who it was, but somebody was asking to share slides. Yes. I was wondering if you could do you have slides that you are prepared to test. You don't? Okay. One one of the things is is that As I if I am sharing, I have to stop sharing before somebody else can share."

Chairs run their meetings just slightly different. So you'll just wanna check to ask them. Are you gonna be sharing my slides, or do you want me to share my screen? And if you check that ahead of time, then you'll know what what you'll be doing. Sure. Yep. We'll do that. Thank you. Of course. We have covered all of the general basics of Mead echo. Hopefully, you have a little better under standing of how the client works, what it looks like, what buttons to use, we're going to just stick in the room for a little bit longer. If you have any questions, specifically, like, on your machine or on your phone that you need help with. We're happy to test things out with you. Otherwise, we hope, using Mireco this week goes very clearly. Just remember when you enter the session, you want to, either scan the QR code or enter the full client on the agenda. Just so that your participation can be counted, that you attended the meeting. And that you can be identified if you have a question. You go to the queue. Other than that, we're Just gonna stick around here. And so thank you for coming. Hopefully it was helpful, and we'll see you, during the week. Alright. thank you. Thank Bye. Now that I'm in another room here in the room, does anybody wanna Does anybody need help? Mona. Any more what?"
