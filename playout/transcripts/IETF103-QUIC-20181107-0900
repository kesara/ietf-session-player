    "text": "you can share a single crypto handshake with all of your other streams so you essentially get this multiplex Datagram channel with a connection you already have you get to inherit any of the features of our quick handshake which maybe have more nuances than what DTLS allows you to do around retransmission around transport parameters something we can\u0027t add those to DTLS of course we could but as we evolved quick you get any of those benefits that we\u0027re adding to quick and also adds the ability to acknowledge your data grams which gives some insight into packet loss properties it\u0027s not perfect but it\u0027s potentially interesting next slide so some of the example use cases and there can definitely a lot more than this any application that wants both a reliable stream and an unreliable stream between two peers for audio video streaming with control and their actual data frames or gaming they could take advantage of this and actually not have to worry about having different states for different connections being blocked so this simplifies things a lot it also allows you to get into some VPN style tunneling of IP packets or other datagrams over a quick connection you want unreliable when you\u0027re tunneling so that you don\u0027t incur extra layers of recovery and this also allows you to potentially hide the fact that you\u0027re doing a VPN so there\u0027s a whole bunch of things that this opens up next slide please so the protocol details are pretty simple these are totally open to negotiate and change maybe a Datagram frame there are two code points one is for one that extends all the way to the end of the packet and one has a length field if you want to have other frames in there the only other change in the actual protocol is that you add and accepts Datagram transport parameter to indicate that you support this feature slide so there are a couple design decisions that we\u0027ve discussed one is do we act these Datagram frames this is something new that things like UDP and DTLS don\u0027t do currently the draft says yes this is an interesting way to gauge loss on the network with the caveat that of course this doesn\u0027t guarantee that the peer occupation actually is processing this Datagram the next one is so this is something that we discussed on the list I think it\u0027s a little bit more controversial I think what we have in the draft is wrong um it currently says that yes we should have datagrams contribute contribute to overall limits and have some type of flow control the problem is that when you start pulling that thread it gets very complicated very quickly and it\u0027s unclear if this is really a huge benefit so I think we would like to remove that from the proposals but if anyone has reasons that they want datagrams and unreliable frames to contribute to flow control that\u0027d be interesting to hear yeah I think that um I think this is that we have here\u0027s the right answer the problem is that if you want to substitute on if you want to substitute you know this for something like DTLS or ordinary UDP then those applications assume there\u0027s no flow control and so now it\u0027s perfectly if you have my flow level flow control you could be like here\u0027s an infinite amount of data "
