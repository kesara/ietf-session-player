Thank you So first we got this no well, and you must be familiar with it. If this is your first time, please do raise the rate and there are some precise and policies you need to follow and the IPR issues you need to be aware of and also some guidance here you could refer to And we also got this note really well. It's more about the behavior and we have this idea anti-harassment procedures If you, it's more about you, we need to be friendly and respectful to other people's work And if you do have any concerns, please resolve [silence] and there is some meeting tips, things were the first session and you could get yourself familiar with it And please do sign into this session where the data track of the QR code and so you will have"

Okay, so, yeah, so hi, everyone. My name is Franco Michel I'm researcher at you, C. Louvain And the topic of the talk here is running SSH connection over HTTP 3. So the idea is to rethink the design of the design of this and run it over border transport protocols such as Quick TLS and HDP So SSH is quite famous so you may know it already The idea of SSH is to provide a set of secure services on top of an insecure network So the set of services is like having a remote interactive shell access You can send also as you could see comments and you can do, for instance, TCP"

Then you have the SSH user authentication protocol, which allows you to authenticate users on top of us using passwords or public keys And then you have the SSH connection protocol which is doing the actual SSH work of spawning processes and communicating with them next slide and so if you want to implement this you have to implement the three protocols and multiplex it over a single TCP connection. Next slide and let's say you want to you want to extend the crypto agorisms, like adding a new one then you typically extend the transport protocol and add new code points for new crypto algorithms, and so you update the document and then you update the implementation Next slide so SSH V2 is widely used but it still has some limitations. For instance, it cannot forward UDP packets, so that means that you cannot forward quick connections and you cannot forward some real-time protocols that are based on UDP, for instance. It can also be easily detected and blocked so SSH typically runs on 422 22, so you can simply block port 22, and if you're also server is running on another port, then you can simply inspect the payload of TCP packets If you see clear text SSH version string, then it's an"

For instance, the recent therapy attack was about that it was missing around with the sequence number of TCP to be able to skip some parts of the algorithms negotiation it's also not really well integrated with modern web infrastructures So if you look at modern web infrastructures, you have many ways to authenticate your users. You can use SAML2 you can use Open ID Connect, for instance or WebOthen and Pass Keys and if you want to integrate it with SSH, it can work but you have, for instance, to deploy middlewares that keep mapping between users and public key or generate open SSH certificate to do so. So it's doable, but there is a deployment burden And also it evolves in parallel to the web protocols such as TLS, Quick and HTTP these protocols also propose a secure channel and encryption and you authentication but it evolves in parallel with SSH. And so you have some features that are similar between the two protocols, such as certificates, but for instance, SSH certificates are not widely used, but SSA certificates are used everywhere And so you can have cases where, for instance, you have users that deploy their VM with an HTTP server and simply the HTTP server works well. It has a public service but the maintainer connects to the VM using SSH and it's not using any certificate it relies on the first and first use pattern It could use open SSH certificates but it has not access to the ecosystem of X509, and so it's"

Next slide So let's see how it works in our proposal to establish a new SSH So the proposal is called SSH 3 I'll be happy to discuss renaming later So now let's focus on the idea of the protocol itself but how to start up an SSH 2 connections. First, you do the quick hand shake Next slide. Once the handshake is a step established, you use HTTP. You send the HTTP extended connect method, where you can set a protocol. Here is SSH3 and to authenticate the user you use the authorization header of HTTP and so basically here you can use any kind of authentication schemes that you want with HTTP. Next slide. If it works for if you choose a good scheme and if the user really authentications then you will have a 200 status code and the conversation is established, and you can use quick strings and stuff.

Next slide and you can also have connection migration so that if you change your IP address, if your user is mobile then you can reattach the quick connection with disrupting the SSH connection which is quite nice. Next slide You also have quick that encrypts and authenticate all the control headers. Next slide You have access with low effort to do X509 ecosystem quite easily So here on the screenshot is just to show that without prototype, we just rented an Azure VM, run the server and using Axx generates the certificates as a classical HD server, and you can access it right away without the tofu pattern. Next slide You also have your multiplexing, so let's say you have several VMs or content on the same physical host. You could put a reverse proxy on front of it and do multiplexing based on the URL or based on the user or based on the SNI, for instance. Next slide. You have a sheet authentication so with that you can simply implement password or publicly key authentication that are used with SSH2, next slide you can also do a certificate based client authentication, but you can also do more. You can use, for instance, open ID connect without any middleware and stuff, which is widely used And you can also think of maybe a or next slide, maybe web author or Pass Keys.

Next slide So what about the threat? So there is one here, TCP only networks so sashv2 runs on top of TCP port 22. It's quite well supported on the internet. HTTP 3 runs on UDP Port 443. It's less well supported so it might be blocked by default in many networks So there are ways to mitigate the problem we could use TCP as well in addition to UD by running SSH over HTTP 2 There is also the recent quick-ound streams proposal, which is proposing to run quick over TCP That might be interesting as well And we could also run SSH over web transport that supports both quick and TCP so it uses both for us and so we don't have to bother too much about that next slide And so yeah, that's that's it's it for me. So now I have a couple of questions for you So is that work interesting? Does it? ring a bell um it's interesting, what would be the best? outcome for the proposal? Would it be an act? SSHV3 candidate in the future? Of course, we need implementation that worked well before thinking of any of that but still, should we integrate it to another? existing protocol? I know that mask is already doing the whole UDP-IP forwarding stuff, so we might think of an mask method such as Connect Shell or Connect process, or maybe we could think of other designs is anyone interested to collaborate on the draft I'd be happy to have any person that wants to"

So let me know If anyone wants to implement and interpret, let me know as well. It's quite easy to implement because it's only the connection protocol to implement on top of HTTP 3 so if you have access to an h3 lib with TLS or quick, it would work well It's interesting enough that we have a bit of a queue to discuss So maybe we should move on to that. Sure Mike Bishop is first Mike Bishop I'mai editor for age three Bishop, Akamai, editor for H3. So I'm, I like the general direction. I'm a little caution about trying to do an something on top of HTTP and then reach down into quick I think web transport might be the better path forward there if you're going that direction. I also kind of wonder if you still need the TCP connections when you doing something that might already have mask on it. Okay well... But that's stuff that can be worked out later. As far as the dispatch question, yes. I do think that this is squarely in the ITFs remit I don't think there's an existing working group that would contain this, so this is probably something to have a bough on, see if there's enough impetus to spend up a working group Thank you, Mark Nottingham Hi, Mark Nottingham. Longtime user of SSH very happy to see more being put into it I question what the utility of putting it on top of H here is, of the list of advantages that you said you were getting, almost all of them are just from using quick not from HTTP, and especially if things are downgraded to H2 or H2 or H2, which can happen because remember, HTTP is a hop-by-hot protocol"

But really, question the need to go over HTTP And just at a higher level, maybe for this community, we see to be more and more knee-jerk, oh, let's put that over HTTP And while that's great for my job security, I think we should really think about that architecturally. So to the dispatch question, you would point to a boff also? I think Abaf would be fine. Okay, thank you. I don't have strong opinions on the particular path. Great. Tommy Pauley? Heather, thank you for sharing this Yeah, definitely interesting work I think we should consider this. I think as people have been leaning towards, Boff, would make sense just to figure out what shape would be right. If you are doing it over HTTP, as you've suggested, you're right that it's very similar to mask. It doesn't really fit in the charter of mask because it's not really proxying in the same way But, you know, if you're doing that, we should have definitely review from the community in there. We also have other things going on in the HDP BIS working group of, like, Connect TCP, of like, modern versions of also doing the similar thing. So we want review there if we're going in that direction, but I think also the point about web transport are interesting so let's have a boff and try to maybe talk about all the different ways you could spell this and figure out which one makes most sense Sounds good. We're going to need to close the queue if I can figure out how to do that, but David Skunazi is next Hi, David Skarnazi, putting stuff over HG enthusiast I'm really excited by this work.

Christopher Allen Yeah, so I share some of the questions of, you know, everything over H.T although I think that's it's not unreasonable, but I also feel like you know, we've kind of waved our hands at the SSP off side of things, and I just have a lot of questions about using the same keys for SSH developer use in some of the peer to peer things that are natural and easy with SSH that are hard with HTTP So I'm hope, I'd like to see this as a boff, but I would like to also either know that this is only going to be focusing on transport and, you know, you know, sort of make a better layering for authentication, or that they're also going to be looking at the larger problems of auth and khaki usage and all of that Thank you Great, thank you. Ecker, next [silence] Hi, Erica Skorla. So, you know, you definitely sing my song about having one transport that's good, and I think if we were designing us from scratch, this would, like, clearly be something along this angle would clearly be right The problem is we're not designing a session or scratch. There's a huge deployed base of SSH And so I think the threshold question, and so I agree with people who said that there should be a boss on to, um, going to do this. But I think threshold question for that box, ought to be, are any people who are currently deploying SSH? at scale, including the, like, big SSH clients in terms of in doing this? Because they're not an ITF producing something that says you do SSH for quick is kind of like not going to make it very well So I think that the ISG should determine prior to proving this BOP, whether or not that is, in fact, the case because having a boff when like no one wants to do it as silly.

Alex Hi, I'm Alex Schenhovsky, Google. I'm also one of the maintainers of Mosh, which is, I think the first use of an SSH-like thing over UDP And I want to say that I'm very excited in having this work move forward. There's a bunch of feature requests in Mosh that would be solved by this work by people basically wanting the benefits of UDP transport along with the reliable streams of TCP So I think definitely we need to move forward on this I have lots of evidence that users want this and would deploy this including Google internally users of Mosh So I definitely want to see if this move forward. I think Abaf is fine. I also think mask is fine, but we definitely would need to do a recharter I think that the question of why not quick is absolutely answer by the Mosh precedent. We need the TCP callback. We need all these things to work well. Okay, thank you Richard Burns Hi, Richard Barnes. Just a quick medical question. I think both is the obvious answer a plus one on that. I just hate it every time we dispatch something to a buff that takes another three months and we waste all that time. So let's, I'm looking over at the very ADs, like, let's please keep this moving and have a virtual boff in between the ITS Sounds good, thank you. Martin Thompson. Yeah Martin Thompson. I think Christopher mentioned this, but I think the question of do we do transport? or do we do transport and all the various authentication? options might turn into a bit of an attractive nuisance. So I suggest that some work be done ahead of any boff on refining the scope a little bit. So it's very clear what any working group might be working on because I think the plethora of options that were presented to us is likely to cause failure more than success.

For many, there are many pro just as some example the endpoint can update, rotate its keeper without the need or refreshing the VC The endpoint can also revoke immediately its the idea and the identity.

And ideally, that specification should be done in an organization that actually works on these verifiable credentials so I would just do that in the W3C, right, the specification alongside of the group who I'm not a W3C expert who already works on these verifiable credentials and does the work there. If someone does something similar for things like CWD and J.W.D as it would be, for, for example, in Spice then clearly there, there potential home there, but it was not proposed there and was not discussed, so purely speculation It looks pretty straightforward to me, just add a red to that registry and done Okay, thank you, Ecker Ecker I changed microphone, so we'll see if this one's any less terrible.

Okay, thank you Richard Burns. I am Richard Barnes I would like to dispatch this to the future I think that, like Eric and Hahn is are totally right, that the places should ultimately end up is in TLS or as a private registration, but I think the VC space is just too unsettled right now to do things in the ITF. There's a bunch of you know, multiple defined non-interoperable stuff, and we just need some time for the space to settle down and get some deployment first before we start defining these code points. Once that, settling down has happened, I think it'll be straightforward as Eckron Hunas pointed out, and we'll just do it in TLS, and it'll go. So if we're going to dispatch it somewhere today, I'll send it to TLS, but I think we should hold off a little bit before we do that. Okay, thank you Wes. Thanks, Wes Hartaker, I say.

We also have we see a strong correlation between a routes and having more optimized servers and better server location and so it actually makes the experience better routing but also v6 is you know the future that has been coming for a very long time So we want to use it. Next slide, please But, of course, we can't always use IPV6 even if it's available because sometimes it's broken, and that was the whole reason for motivating happen eyeballs in the first place. Next slide, please So there are various things that can go wrong Servers can essentially be available on V6, but be broken or slow. Networks can offer you V6 connectivity, but they may have middle boxes that slow things down or actually break connectivity. But one of the insights that we get from Happy Eyeballs overall is that choosing just one address and trying to make a connection to that and waiting before you ever try anything else that you have as an option is a bad idea. You're more likely to run into an issue. And this actually extends to things beyond just which IP address you want to connect to of a server but all of the other options you have. Banking on just one option working doesn't work very well. Next slide So I'm briefly going to go over what the V2 algorithm is.

They are a staggered parallel race where you choose your most preferred option, then you choose the next preferred option after a delay that's based on the round trip time of the network. Next slide You can look at this in detail These are some numbers that we've shared before in MapRG and other venues, but overall we find that Happy Eyeballs does a great job of helping us use V6 when it is a very available and when you have networks and when you have dual stack hosts available, but we also see that even when all the stars otherwise align a stack that's doing Happy Outwows v will end up using V4 around like 7 of the time globally, so we do still see brokenness out there So it still matters to do this. Next slide, please As a sidebar, there's some discussion that's happened around happy eyeballs that doing this type of racing can hide brokenness in middle boxes, etc. We believe that's something that doesn't belong in the core algorithm document, but is something that should be addressed and discussed somewhere within the IATF about how can we do better reporting for errors Next slide. All right, so that takes us to why do we need a new version So Nidie, go ahead. Yeah, so I'll talk about version three of the algorithm. Next slide, please So why do we need a new version? So there have been lots of changes to DNS"

Next slide, please please So the updated algorithm follow the same overall phases as the previous version as Tommy talked about earlier. Next slide [silence] However, there are slight tweaks to incorporate the new addition which are bolded. So when we asynchronously core DNS, we now query for SCCB records in addition to the quad ANA records, placing SVCB responses first, since they provide better hints about addressed families, ECH, priority, and protocol support There are some additional considerations to incorporate and prioritize SVCB-based responses in the rest of those sections as well. Next slide [silence] So the sorting algorithm for the addresses stays mostly the same except with the addition with the addition of ECH key SVCP priorities, and ALPNs, if they're present and we prioritize these ahead of the other criteria to maintain security while respecting priority signals and protocol preferences. Next slide And finally, when making our connection, the previous version raised attempts until the TCP handshake completed but this meant that we might have ended up with a broken or slow TLS handshake where another attempt might have succeeded sooner. In the updated algorithm, we raised connection attempts until the full handshake completes, whether that's TLS over TCP or quick.

However, as you've seen there may many areas that are involved in this version of the algorithm, which we'd like review from, including IPV6, DNS Quick, HTTP, MTLS Some options that have been suggested are continuing in B6 ops with reviews from other groups moving to TSPWG as it's a more general trend group or forming a new working group in W area, focusing on client algorithms and operations So we'd love any feedback about the best place for this work.

    "text": "There's a clear analogy to postal mail handling and all all-involved parties benefit from having a standards-based approach to resolving the problem. Next slide, please So, here is a real non-theater problem. What can recipients do about misdirected email? What you see on the right is an actual email? I got in late December. I get maybe one of these a week sometimes for a Diane Weekly, sometimes for a Jeffrey sometimes for a Doug. Some would argue that I should just mark the email as spam because it's the sender's responsibility to ensure that emails are sent to the intended party and should be double opt-ining a user to make sure that they only send email to the intended recipient for a given account. While there's a great of truth to that, there's also flows that make it much more challenging to verify an account holder's correct email address, such as if a user wrote an email address on a sheet of paper for sign-up or faxed it in, and yes, that's still a thing or representative took the email address over the form. Now, in this situation, the sender is legitimate and otherwise has proper mail sending hygiene with correct ARC D mark SBF and dek but what it doesn't have is either an unsubs link or one-click unsubscribe because it's not a sub-subscribed list. I have no standard way to tell the sender that they've got the wrong person for this account, and I really would rather not spend an hour on the phone with the sender to try and get them to update the records. It would be nice if there were, like one click on unsubscribe, a simple way to just tell my mail client to tell the sender that they got the wrong guy Next slide, please So postal mail solve this about a hundred years ago you probably get misdirected postal mail all the time. The post office knows this as part of the definition of first-class mail that they'll transit the letter back to the center if there was an issue with delivery. And one of the issues with delivery is there's no such person at the address. So you bounce the letter back to the sender, and hopefully that kicks off a process, whereby the sender can attempt to find a better address for the recipient or no another way to get in touch with them, like a phone number.

The human rights to you, and it's misdirected you can just write back to them like, hey, you sent this to the wrong person What I like about a proposal that gives a wrong recipient notification is that this benefits the wrong recipient who will, in theory, no longer get the emails not intended for them. It'll benefit the sender because they might accidentally be transmitting PII to a third party, and it benefits the correct recipient because they finally actually get the email that was intended for them Next slide, please So let's say we craft some sort of a return path for misdirected email We could call this a wrong recipient flow. So what? What is this option, what options does the sender have if they get? one of these notifications? The first is that it's likely that they have the wrong email address for the user, so they should make a best effort to try and connect with the user via some other channel to very a correct email address. They could use a phone call, a text message postal mail, email to prior addresses used send a push notification if the user has their app installed or even show a message in the app or web experience that they need to update and confirm their new email address. And they may want to stop sending emails to that known bad address for the account Note that this is different than a do not email indication. The user may have a separate relationship with the sender for a different account that is correct. Of course, and does note earlier, if the sender validates the email address mapping to an account this will mostly be avoided. Next slide, please Cool So if we think that email should have the same, no such recipient capability, as postal mail has had for centuries, what are some ways that we could implement? this?

Indeed, one of the 8058 authors has been helping me with the proposal. Next slide slide So here is the proposal. It's actually, in its essence, completely contained in this page. There's a header that senders include for wrong recipient notifications, and there's a post to the address by a mail client when the user indicates that an email has been misdelivered. That's it. You'll notice here a assigned URL, but there's explicitly not included in the standard a strict recommendation on how to sign the URL since it's only the sender who needs to be able to validate it The client just blindly posts to the provided URL after the user action with the fixed post body and nothing else.

I mean, you mentioned NDRs, but technically it's just encoding a user interfacing based on NDRs because technically we just send an NDR to the return path, and people would just be required to actually do some kind of handling for return path emails, which I mean if operators like ESPs would pick that up that much"

Could you be a little bit loud? Alyssa? Sure What I was saying was that it was a conscious decision to make 6973 advisory and not mandatory because we thought that making it mandatory would just cause it to become a check-the-box exercise that nobody wouldn't pay attention to. And instead, I think if you look, there's actually like a good amount of evidence of how it has been used in certain cases There's also been discussion about updating it so that's something that you're interested in, definitely would be interested in talking about that because there's lots of things that have changed in the times since it was published, but it's meant to be advisory and guide and not protocol.

Ted Hardy Ted Hardy, thanks very much. I think the basic problem here is there are three different things, yoke together and the fastest way to get progress here is probably to unyoke them So if you have small-scale things that relate to the work that's already going on in Cozay, unyoke them from the larger scale question and go to Cozay with it If you have large-scale questions of theta minimization and how it affects human rights, you can talk to Cullen or to the working group chairs for HRPC but those people can't do protocol work in the ITF, just like we can dispatch things to the IRF so I think you've got multiple different things kind of all put together into a vision here, but the actual work needs to be taken back out and sent to the right places, and there's no single dispatch for the whole. Some of it's just, frankly, out of scope for the ITF as a whole. So I just encourage you to go back and break this into the chunks of work that needs to get done and then ask again with the individual chunks separated out, and I think the answers will be much easier.

This adds extra bytes that needs to send for each frame, and also adds this additional processing It's not very expensive operation, but on the server side, where there is a lot of requests This is multiplied by a lot By masking was added.

You know, I think this needs more motivation, frankly before we should be thinking of doing it That motivation would come in the form of two things, one of demonstrating there's substantial cost associated with the padding with the masking, given that you're already encrypting the data and having to do AES or cha-cha So I think, like, the measurements will be helpful The other four measures to be helpful would be demonstrating this is no longer an issue And, you know, I think you work for a company that has a browser, so you could take those measurements if you wanted You could replicate the work that was done, you know, back in 2011 But I think, you know, saying we don't think it's an issue, but we don't know, the way we got into the hole was we didn't think it was an issue and somebody checked And so, I think at minimum before you move of security, feature, which you actually verify there's no longer an issue I do want to make one small technical point, which is, that the fact that you think implementations are only stooping on AD does not necessarily help, because the attacker controls the website server, and therefore they can simply do, they can simply do the cash poisoning on 80 themselves with TLS As far as I can tell browsers, we'll do HGPS on 80 just fine so that doesn't actually help you [silence] Okay, David Skunazi David Skinazzi, Masking enthusiast.

Alessandro Gadini, Cloudflare I think an additional problem to the mid- box cash poisoning thing is that there are some middle boxes that actually try to actively look at the WebSocket data and sometimes even try to inject like close frames. And I suspect that because the sort of the negotiation mechanism for the extension would be end to end, and because these kind of proxies tend to not be updated as often as, you know, we would like as Mark was saying, I suspect a lot of those would probably break. How much that is a problem in practice is, I guess, to be seen but it would be good to try and maybe some experiments, if possible, before we decide to actually do this.

In this case, if there is a fossil flooding attack is ongoing, and the attack is transferred from the network of the operation to the enterprise, for the enterprise it can detect the attacks in seconds, but because of the limited resources, it can mitigate the large-scale deducts attack So it need the help of the operator. Before the operator, although it has the enough resources but because of the sample-based, detect method, it can only detect a text in minutes, which is very slow. So we think the emperor, and the operator should exchange the information to do the collaborative mitigation Actually, we already have Dots Open Threat signaling to do the exchange of the information. The enterprise can initiate mitigation requests to the operator, and the operator can acknowledge that text in time, in minutes, and the device the mitigation strategies, and then give the response to the enterprise, and then the collaborative mitigation can start Next slide, please.

It must be mitigated by a scrubbing device. So in this case, the DOS client should choose the DotsR1 server one.

This should never happen, but it's does, and one of the reasons it does is because in Java, the native char data type is actually a UTF 16 code point, and if you prefix in a range by taking the first 10 characters, it's real easy to end up with one of these things. So these are really problems They break in all sorts of ways and just should never appear. Next slide, please Then there are some other code points that are not characters, and they are called non-characters The history is complicated and boring, but Unicodes specifically that don't use these except internal applications. They don't define what they mean by internal applications, but I'm pretty sure they mean not over the internet And they can't be displayed. They have no use So what we want to do is offer three subsets that in part are in whole avoid these problematic characters, and thus aren't safer and better So the first one, next slide, please is called Unicode Scalers And this is all the code points that aren't surrogates and it's actually pretty widely used, not just in Seabor and IJson, but over in the W3C, you know, the White Working Group and things like that, they use Unicode Scalers quite a lot and they're much better than all the Unicode points because they exclude the surrogates, which are the most problematic but they include all the control codes and non-characters and so on Having said that, you know, you may end up having to have to use this if you are wanting to handle seabor messages Next slide, please Then, in 1998, XML picked this set of characters to bless"

So that already makes it a useful document in some way. But I think it's really should be useful And the episode that Tim related to was in Jason Parth, we had this"

Toxic waste is something that is not Unicode, but something that adjacent parser is going to ingest and then get terrible stomach cake And then Tim even had an example where one of his systems broke when that happened. So that's one thing Then there is this weird term problematic character and every character is problematic is problematic, and lowercase A is problematic What you need to understand is what is your application and what do you want to do with these characters and so on So I think we really need a document that gives useful advice to people who want to define new protocol If you want to use an old protocol that already tells you how to do that So SMTP tells you exactly how to operate in this space. We don't need a document for that but you need a document for new implementers And I think we should find some way to have such a document I thought I might just write it quietly somewhere but now that this document is out there as well, it's going to be the next subject in this meeting, so I'm going to shut up now Okay, thank you. Harold Haral Alastram Unicode offers many opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot This document well, I like the presentation better than the document because the document seems to say that as long as you're only handling code points and don't care what the code points mean you can get away with only doing this, etc of rules"

This could be a use document But I'm not sure where we should take it to get to that useful document. That was my next question [silence] Ory Steele. All right Orsteel, incoming Art AD The, back to the disc patch question, I heard folks saying we will this was a Pracey profile, Precy is a working group that's not currently active Has there been, is there a giant pool of work? that needs more Pracey work in the chat? I can hear folks saying they looked at Pracey and they decided not to use it in recent documents for various reasons. So I'm bit concerned that we're sort of pinning Pracey on this while we can also see evidence that folks don't want to use Pracey To the dispatch question, regarding this, it seems like it's headed either for an AD sponsor or for a new Pracey working group with a whole bunch of other challenges associated with that process And I don't like either of those options personally.

So no working group needed Do you want to summarize that? Okay, so for this draft, presentation is a good brief and provide useful advice, at least a good starting point And for the work, so people maybe more prefer to precise, although it's not popular yet, so and the some suggestions to work more on the prices and make it more visible and yeah.

Next slide, please So obviously, this is not happening in a vacuum We had this draft in 1936 which was called an RFC at the time, RFC 20, which we actually turned up into a IATF standard some decades later, which is ASC And Esky was an externally was an externally defined document that we imported and started to use a lot in the Internet, I think we can say it's built on ASCII and well an interesting document here for instance is RFC4, which is the telnet protocol specification some of you may remember telnet and that defined a network virtue charmnet. And that's pretty much what has, uh, um, added the specification to asky as a foundational document, how we actually use it in the IT and then 15 years later, it became clear that ASC is not enough We had to do something about the cover more characters, and we got an ITF policy on character sets and languages, and Harald is one of the"

I think we all agree that UTF is the way we are going to interchange a document and the underlying Unicode is going to be our character model And actually, five years later, we got another internet standards which defined YouTube which defined UTF 8 more precisely. This came as a sequence of several documents until it was completed And finally, in March 2008 John, who has also been on the microphone already, co-authored document that essentially replaced NVT the old network virtual terminal, with one that is based on unique code and answer a few questions that came up when you do this So this is essentially the platform on which we stand and the question is is there anything left open here? Next slide The problem really is, or not the problem, the problem, the opportunity the nice thing, is that we don't need a network virtual terminal very much anymore So we're not using Telnet that much that much We are using SSH, but today we are defining protocols that have their own structure. We have XML, we have JSON we have C ball, we have whatever And these already provide this structure that we use to have to derive from ASC. And ASCII, you have something called record separators and unit separators. I don't know if you remember those. We actually used them in JSON sequence but normally the structure is coming from something else like XMAR JSON, CBOI representation format. So the protocol designers today use XML"

And, well, at the end of, at the start of the previous decade, I was helping in designing a protocol, and ran into the problem, we needed some more text So we actually referenced 5198 but it wasn't that useful I mean, it still works, but it was a compromise. And as some people have said, unique code is more complex than ASCi was. So protocol designers really need help. Next slide So, given the this came up again in the context of another development that I'm going into called Coswit I started writing a document and trying to get feedback on the art mailing list with some excurs to internationalization directorate and also got lots of good feedback and learned a lot beautiful the approach the approach here is to have a relatively simple menu of choices that a protocol design can make Unfortunately, these need options because applications are different But this is about eight pages of documents And then I have some more 10 pages of appendices about terminology, which is really important in this way about the history legacy issues and how we got that toxic waste into our system sometimes Unicode Normalization, which relevant to many people who think it isn't relevant to them and finally relationship to 51, 90 next slide so the objective for this document was supposed to be used for protocol developers"

But also maybe as a reference that the new specific can point to and say, we are using this particular subset of unique Of course, this subject could be expanded. A lot should become long document, then it would become less use for developers. So really, the guide aspect is quite useful as it is. The reference aspect, is. The reference aspect might require a downref in a document that uses this or might require some standardization. So I don't have a strong opinion on this, but I think that would be used to have as a reference mechanism I'm not thinking so much about formal mechanisms like presi profile and so on, but simply as something that can be pointed to and, for instance, the difference between one dimension and two-dimensional is pretty important in many other cases so this is something that this document can be pointed to So I could just continue, develop it in quiet on my own or we could set up something that looks at this in a more consensus-oriented way I'm not proposing anything specific, but given the previously discussed document, I would like to hear you Okay does anyone have any opinions on dispatching this? Karsten, what in the absence of a queue, what would be your preference about how you would like to see us dispatch this? Well, I thought I got pretty good feedback on art So there is a certain kind of consensus that is wavering through the room, but it's not captured. And I'm mainly interested in getting in"

Go ahead, Colin I'm not an expert in this space, Colin Jennings. I've seen an incredible amount of time and energy spent into these problems, and my read of your document car is that it comes to slightly different conclusions on some of the things than some of the other mini working groups that have looked at this area deeply. And having yet another set of conflicting advice on this stuff will probably make the situation worse than better. So I think if we do something on this, we need to do it in a you know, fairly serious working group type way. This is not something that an AD can just, you know, sponsor or that we can just do slow in some area like that. We'd need to get, we need to be very serious about it and be willing to deprecate some, you know, say some of the stuff we did in the past was wrong and we're going to do this instead. Sorry don't agree with that part of your statement because I mean, we have legacy and we will always have this legacy Of course. We will still have Jason with all that toxic waste in it we are not going to change this. This is for new designs, useful points that people can congregate I understand, but it's advice for new design might be a little bit different than what some of our previous published documents would say about new design, and that's why I think this will be complicated Thank you. John Clenson [silence] First of all, I agree with Colin about the complicated part Our general internationalization work is in a bit of disarray a situation which has been discussed at length with some of the relevant ADs, and we may be on track to getting some forward progress, which we have, in my opinion, been less last couple of years"

I'm not opposed to this draft, but I think it needs to be part of a larger picture Thanks Thank you, Ted Hardy Ted Hardy, I believe again, you have two different things you're trying to do, and that the answer may be different from the two different things. From the guide perspective, I don't think that needs to be a standards track RFC and in fact, it might be a better guide if it were not an RFC at all but one where it could iterate more rapidly as experience with trying to use it for different protocols situations was learned. So I think for the guide side I would suggest to take it out of the RFC stream entirely"

How to all this, John again? have some of the same objections to this draft as to the other drafts meaning that the amount of trouble you can get into is much larger than the draft seems to indicate But comparing this one to the other draft, [silence] to come to... They are frankly incompatible. Publishing both would be a disaster So, if we want to specify something that says here a reasonably sane set of unico to use in these particular situations we need to get one. We can't dispatch both [silence] Okay, that's the end of the queue Can you summarize that? Try.
