And the rest of the presentation really talked about the innovations we've had over the last 10 years I'm going to cover these four different protocols and then conclude by sharing more about where work is happening So decentralized identifiers are one of our big innovations. They were approved by the W3C version 1.1 and there is a new maintenance working group currently in progress along with a mandate to specify a resolution So how are our digital identifiers managed? today, sort of today meaning perhaps? five years ago, but there was not many choices when our community started work.

They might be about another person, so, or another thing Like, pallets of goods can't hold their own credentials like an entity that is helping manage them through the processes is holding them. And then the holder can share information share verifiable presentation of the verifiable credential to a verifier In the earlier language of identity management, this would be the identity provider and that would be the verifier would be the reliance party but because we don't have a phone home model, notice how the issuer and the verifier are not actually connected or talking to each other, this is a different type of identity management model, so new words were appropriate appropriate And the issuer anchors, the public key material that they used to sign this credential somewhere and the verifier can go look up the public key material associated with the issuer and then decide whether they believe the credential came from where they it's claimed to come from and also whether"

Those are all being actively grappled with within the EU they have set out very clear requirements that wallets must meet If certain oligopolis meet those requirements, they may be let into that ecosystem but they are very cautious to avoid that happening They have put millions of dollars into large-scale pilots and also reference architecture, reference code that's open source Right.

Okay, so particularly, in a bunch of IOT spaces, we are often spending up today private PKIs, this monitor just died. Okay And did it die before? No, there it came back And one of the issues is, for instance, if you're aware of a concept called an I-Dev, which is I-Triple-E 802-1 certificate, it's not very well defined, and about 90% of it are just pointers to RFCs But when you get through that, you wind up with what's called an I-dev ID and people or enterprises makers will spin up a PKI, a private PKI, and they'll then stand an IDEV ID in every device That's true at some level for mobile phones. Some vendors have an I-dev, I have a device ID in every phone. And there's also things where, for instance, there is, you know, every batch of 10,000 phones has a has certificate that attests to the fact that I'm a phone of a particular kind, and that's used in remote attestation But every single one of these private PQIs, it enforces its own namespace.

It's hard to do, right? You can put path constraints and other things like that, but that simply makes it more and more complicated um so there's lots of good things for it and actually industry is moving very i don't want to say quick but, you know, it's kind of like elephants don't move quickly but you know you still don't want to be in a stampede of them And that's happening and that's, that's a, that's good because they're actually putting a identities and five years ago if I said you're going to put an identity every device about half the entities we're like no no that's too complicated. Well, and about half of them were all already putting identities in their devices, and they didn't even know that So then we have the thing, okay, I'd like to make a TLS connection. I'd like to make it to the other end, and I'd like to use the identity I already have, and how can I do that?

Maybe what we should do is use the namespace we already have We used for servers, and that's DNS. And so then the question is, okay, so how do I manage this? How do I put? TLS identities, client side certificates? and how do I indicate what's going on? So that's what the dance working group is about and and there's just you know you think, well, isn't it just a solved problem? And yeah, there's just one or two little bits that we needed to add.

And so we basically are looking through all a bunch of different things. And we have an architecture document that explains how these different protocols would use client-side certificate why they would use them i would and we have an architecture document that explains how these different protocols would use client side certificates, why they would use them, I can't go through all of that today, and how it would happen In order to make this possible, one of the basically the critical key piece that we needed to be able to say was when you make that TLS connection, you can already put you know um basically the critical key piece that we needed to be able to say was when you make that TLS connection, you can already put, you know, an FQDN, a DNS name as your identity that already is supported, has been supported for ages The issue is having done that, the server side of things is like, okay what do I do with this name? And historically what? you do is you look at your configuration file because you better be configured to use that thing and that's all there was And the concept that you should go look at up in DNS, is from the message from the client to the server that's well you could configure that but if would be configuration. And so what we've actually introduced is a new TLS extension that says, and the name you're looking for is in DNS So go look at it there. Next slide, please So we also looked at some data at rest. So that was a TLS side of things. So pretty much all those previous things were all using TLS. And we then looked at some data at rest.

You want to see this again, I would suggest you go back to the video recording because it's much more entertaining several years ago. Thanks So maybe one question. So I think we definitely understand the motivation and the use cases And I think you probably have got this question a lot You know, is DNS the right? vehicle for doing this? So do you see any problems? Yeah, so I skipped that a little bit or there was maybe a different deck, slide deck that I could have used that had more illustrative things. The issue is that that DNS is already kind of, it's already decentralized and it's already I want to say accessible in the sense that any can go and get a DNS name. You pay a small amount of rent, and then it's unique So that kind of accomplishes what what many people need. They need a unique name that's long-term stable, that they control and they don't have to keep you know paint a people need.

There's informational RFC I'll get the numbers wrong. 4332 or 432 I can't remember which one it is And in that case, we stored raw DNS, raw RSA keys in the reverse DNS.

Yeah, christian huitema the, I have two problems there in your discussion is one you mentioned casually using TLS mutual authentication yes but there are lots of practicalities there, like for example if you go to web page the last thing you want is authenticate so you have to have mechanism to know when you shall authenticate to web page and when you don't so i guess i guess the the last thing you want is authenticate. So you have to have mechanism to know when you shall authenticate to web page and when you don't. So I guess a piece I missed is this is not about web browser to web server stuff. Yeah, right?

So you don't actually own a DNS address you rent it. Yeah. And the rent can be cancelled if one of the authorities tells them and say, yeah, this guy is to doing copy-rari infringement, cancel his DNS And that is a big risk.

My name is Jysol Kumar. And on am very grateful to the dinner-ojee chairs for letting me present some of the perspectives that I've been working on with colleagues on this topic or these trends and themes of centralization consolidation and fragmentation. And we thought it would be a particular interest to this group because of the amount of work that's been done by members of this group on these topics What we want to do is bring some clarity to where they connect as trends, and that's why the name of the presentation is one ring to rule them all So I hope to spend just 10 minutes on this, on the presentation, and then have time for the Q&A an equal amount of time for the Q&A. Great, so moving on to the first slide what the chart shows is what we have analyzed about the text available the literature available on consolidation and centralization that shows taxonomic inconsistency in terms of the use.

And similarly with fragmentation. And that's what we really want to be asking here. Can the IETF do anything? and should it be doing anything? So as you can see on this slide both centralization and consolidation refer to concentration of power, fewer entities having more control and the implications that has for internet architecture and for end users as well But what we noted is that consolidation refers to more the market forces or external market forces and economic forces and centralization is broader and can be about facilitating architectural changes at the protocol level which may then feed into and shape external forces. So it's broader in that sense And that means that efforts to differentiate between the two really come down to where the impact on the network and the end user arises primarily or solely from economic market forces or also from the design of standards and protocols So that's consolidation and centralization And then moving on to fragmentation So what we've got on the slide there is, again, this is a contested term, but there are a couple of frameworks, the World Economic Forum and the Internet government Forum, Policy Network and Internet fragmentation have endeavored to provide frameworks to define or utilize what the term means.

I also wanted to show you what we thought was relevant at the IETF recent meetings, well, particularly 117, there were a couple of present which dealt with the definition of internet fragmentation and these are really one of them, the presentation by I think it's John Heidman and Guillermo Baltrow really quite on the narrow end of the spectrum about connectivity of publicly available IP addresses or more than 50% can connect to each other. That means the internet's not fragmented if that's not the case then it is. So that's quite very narrow definition. And then we had a presentation by Nick Merrill, where he presented a way of measuring fragmentation that's around a set of proxy measures for different layers of the internet stack And really, I think what's interesting about his proposal or research is that it shows how internet fragmentation or how the internet is being shaped by geopolitical forces and control points, which are really about concentration of power in fewer entities, particularly U.S US-owned companies, and how that affects how data is rooted And then we found Mallorina knodel' ID on GitHub also very useful, and because that"

Yeah, there's more about those presentations, but bringing us to the second part of this presentation really, which is what has this got to do with the IETF? What have they all got to do with each other? And what we find is that they share a common concern about concentration of power and resources. And this is of concern because of the impact it could have in time on the stability of the network of the internet as a whole and could impact its openness as well So what's missing is an analysis in our view of how protocols and standards could impact control point, whether by augmenting, their control or diminishing it or being neutral And what we think would be instructive is to consider the end user in all of this as a starting point We wouldn't be starting from scratch if we did that because there are existing principles, including the end principles and RCC's looking at how that's being how it's evolving. But we think that focusing in on how, yeah, how the end user is impacted and bringing together other frameworks could be helpful to answer this question So, moving on Oh, yeah, so this is a kind of provocation"

Are we considering user rights? What is the impact? on choke points or control points or single points? of failure potential and are we preserved the core principles of the end-to-end principle?

Some of those are more like policy ones but some of those are also about whether or not, for example, standards that could impact that need neutrality if deployed, you know, there are, I think a range of use cases there, but what we wanted to do with this presentation was just really present some of the key points and that core point about what unites all of these frameworks and concerns and ask whether there would be interest in building out a framework based on this train of thought.

I don't know if you agree with that or think differently Yes, so actually that RFC that you just mentioned it also says that inappropriate concentration of power on the internet has become concerning phenomenon one that protocol design might have some influence upon, and that's where, you know, that's the starting off point for the question, or answer to your question, which is doing something, what does that look like?

And of course, right, the people who are losing out are the rest of us, right? That aren't big companies on either side It's not marginally making things better. I would also point to, yeah, like sender pays framework in EU and South Korea. Like there's loads of effort to try to correct either the centralization or the consolidation, both the technical and then the market that are just leaving the rest of us out so what I also have for many years agreed that fragmentation is not a perfect term, I think it is the closest one that describes the fail points for people. And yeah end user also is an imperfect framework because I think a lot of these effects are bigger than just like how it impacts the individual, right? Impacts commerce and competition. It impacts human rights. Impacts like much bigger issues.

And where, you know, the hardware supply chain could also take lessons from this approach. andrew stone your point in the chat, I think that the whole reason why we're proposing this more holistic approach that brings together all of these different aspects and principles and frameworks is precisely because just looking at it from one vantage point isn't having the desired impact and is impacting the openness of the internet So we think, you know, bringing me to clarity that these frameworks is our ideal And I haven't been able to follow the chat as I've been speaking, but yeah I thank you all for your, for your time and for all the comments and happy to take this onto the list The contacts are on the last slide and so it's the idea which has much more in it.

And I think in this area, the web innovations stagnated. If you can go to the next slide, we talk about science What we mean by that is that we talk about the DNS and to the next slide, we talk about silos.

So we interact with services via all sorts of protocols and then services store data in usually databases or file systems in the backend but that data is not really usable by anybody except for the entity that collected and stored the data Short example, it's impossible to address a row in a table in a database"

The other one is having control over the data. So that's what we mean by silent I hope it's obvious my observation is that solid is much easier to explain in hindsight So I was thinking maybe of giving you crowd, maybe five minutes to figure it out and then I'm going to explain it as well about going to be much easier. But anyway next slide please Yeah, so this is from the technical report. What's all it is a set of specifications that provide that applications with secured and permission access to externally stored data in an interoperator way These permissioned part is probably the new part and a don't know if you have more questions about that. I'm going to try to touch on that So like I said today, we interact with services, with applications and the applications with services, but the data is hidden in the silo. The solid approach, it kind of reverses all that Instead of having databases, that are structured in a way to serve the application because and make the application performance in service content, we promote a way, it's kind of a new paradigm in which data is stored in solid pods and it's more like if you are domain model it's application independent"

It's a full control over it. The problem is what happens when you want to share it with other entities. So it works very well for enterprises that interact with other entities or people who want to interact with enterprises or people who want to interact with enterprises or people who share data So when you build the first application, basically the pods become sort of a backend for free for your application And if you don't need some additional things like indexes and all that stuff you basically don't need the backend at all because the solid protocol protocol gives you access to the data That's maybe not that interesting, but if you build the 10 application, the 10th application feeding from the same data or maybe 80% of the data the data is already available to you so a lot the the costs of building applications in the solid model is much more effective So what happens when you have the data available? how do you share it with consent?

We use OIDC, by the way, what IDP you use what private keys you might have, and what store is, meaning data pods, you control We also use link data. I'm not going to talk too much about that unless there are questions And as I mentioned before, applications can connect use connect, applications actually use a user identity and via OIDC and one of the trusted IDPs can authenticate and then also authorized with whatever credentials they have to add access the data the pod and the data in the pod and different users, different entities might have access to different kinds of data in the pod pod As I mentioned, I think the solid becomes more interesting in the pot.

So in a way, Sol is a more general web dev if you want, right? WebDev was used kind of in the same way to get access to data in a web dev service So, um, solid is in different is agnostic to what data you put there, right? You can put your images you can put your medical record you can put whatever data, right? So that's governed by vocabulary, as I said, it's sort of like the domain modeling and then it can be shared. And because users control data and they can share data, they become active participants in a data supply chain and they share decisions about what data is shared As a bit of an aside, the fact that you control access to data doesn't necessarily mean that you control the data itself there are some edge cases we have governments in production, for instance, who provide pods to citizens.

But what I started to mention is that while you have control and you know who requires access to the pod, and you can authorize that access or not, it doesn't necessarily mean that you can change the data.

And in particular, for not notifications, I'm really looking at these crowds to give us some advice and help my question is actually how data are identified given now there are applications independent that's the interesting question, yes, very good question So because data is in a pod, the pod actually is identifiable, uniquely identity globally, and data is uniquely identifiable within the pod as a namespace. So the combination of the two uniquely identifiable data. There are other models we're exploring, but that's what we support today Okay, so that is, data is identified by the containers, the pot. Today yes. Actually, you kind of have to do that anyway. We do that with domains and there are better models that we are exploring, as I said Thank you you Hi, Rolf Gerald. So your model provides protection for the data that is inside the pod Sorry. And so when it's at rest at the destination or whatever, is a system that is storing the pod, so you can issue as many pods as you want, you can send it to different destinations, that's correct Sorry. You can encapsulate your data through pods and send them to a different destination Well, you send basically an address but yes. You send a what, sorry? An address So then a requester can request access to the data. Yeah you may get it or not. Okay, but does the data ever travel? somewhere else once it's in the pot? The data at some point, yes, you cannot it's getting a bit"

I think I know where we on request if there is an access grant to the requester. So a copy will be made. I think I know where we're going with this. So my concern is not so much on the transit or not if there is an access grant to the requester. So a copy will be made. I think I know where we're going with this. So my concern is not so much on the transit or when it stays in the host is execution time. So once the data is being executed and you don't have any way to verify what the software that is using that data may or may not be doing with the data itself, all the protection that you have in the previous steps seem to be to be disappearing because if I want for instance, so part of the protection that I always understood Sully was trying to do is to give you your own sovereign across your data. Correct. And you should be able to determine whether you want your data to be copied somewhere else or not And so I'd execute time, my concern with solidity has always been, but that may be because I don't understand the protocol in full that's why I'm asking the question my concern has always been in the last mile. So in the execution time, what happens? with the data that doesn't have knowledge that it is data and that has no knowledge that is being copied? In my opinion, it's very hard to talk about this without talking about the concrete use case because I would say that, and I agree with you, by the way but I don't think Sol is the only thing you should rely on, right? so in the world of decentralized internet that we all I think agree with its premises, right? So some people talk about identities, very good conversation Some people talk about, well, Soli talks about storage, but it's not identities or solid are not going to solve the problem into it end. So we talk about client-to-client protocols and other things that are going to be layered on top of Solid to provide protections like the one you ask about and some other features. But solid is not providing a 100% answer to what you addressed. And actually, we talked with Lisha"

So a good example would be a calendar and what I mentioned as client to client protocols are kind of like Cal Dev in relation to web dev, right? But the calendar changes The fact that you access it and OK, you made the copy whatever trust model you used to trust that the data in the calendar is correct or accurate the fact that you got it and the store of copy doesn't really need me whatever trust model to you use to trust that the data in the calendar is correct or accurate the fact that you got it and the store of copy doesn't really mean much because the data may change but again it depends on the use case.

And I must admit how that happened is now almost of historic interest rather than current interest Moore's Law is coming to a halt We can't continue this doubling with venturing into physics that we really don't understand. And the constant ability to maintain the pressure of every 18 months it just doubles Doesn't seem to be an immediate future option We're going to slow down. What does that mean?

Not really Is there anything it could have done differently? Not really It wasn't theirs to control What was there was that Moore's law opened up an opportunity to unseat the incumbents in the telephone industry and high-risk, high-volume capital, coupled with Moore's Law, took it over That was always going to happen It had all the inevitability of a brick thrown out of the 50 floor of a high-rise building. It was going to fall and hit the ground No other outcome. So from my point of view, there is much to study It's becoming historic, I think, as we move into a different phase of Moore's law.

Suppose you run your own mail server using, say, Microsoft Exchange Well, you can have a fishing attack. You can have something like that But if you move to the cloud, well, that was actually the sell point, the big company are going to secure their service really safe and not of that will happen may not be true but that's continuing and look at what's happening with AI it's a typical application of what Jeff was saying about economics It turns out that training this big AI model is only possible if you are ready to blow a couple of million dollars a billion dollars. So the only guess you can do that are the guys who actually have access to a couple of billion dollars in funding to blow on a single model, and we do it again, and we do it again and the net effect is that they end up with these models which are very very powerful and that nobody can replicate because you don't have the same access to capital And the net net of that is we get further centralization because the venture can capitalists and investors generally have pushed investment and the model is always the same push enough investment quickly enough that you dominate a field and then use the revenue to put it further and further creating some kind of an avalanche"

So Anno TDI, both when Nixia asked me to come in this panel on Sunday evening, I said, reluctantly yes, and then suddenly I see boy, there is Jeff and christian bormann the panel. I mean, what the hell am I doing? here? Anyway, so I can here with two sides So in my job, I'm a global security strategy at Broadcom, formerly Simaotech And I do speak a lot with execution of the Fortune 100 and especially the top 10 banks and so on I do an eye job, which is I spend sometimes in an ATF, but mostly in the ITU So in the ITU, who I have in front of me, is not tech people like us here, but is these regulators. Next week, this like happens 85 of the people will be regulators so maybe we have two optimistics on my left. Maybe I'm the wrong like happens, 85% of the people will be regulators. So maybe we have two optimistics on my left. Maybe I'm the romantic here. So when I when I walk in the forest, I like to see a forest that is wild enough. I like big trees smaller trees, smaller trees, and I hope that this whole ecosystem can, you know, sustain each other and develop diversity and so on. But fortunately, that's not what happens. I think Jeff and Chris are very right. It was predictable that what would happen by the brute force of all the economics, finance, and investments and all of what the rightly explained would lead to where we are now. That means a centralization and concentration But there are some other voices and other forces that play. I will try to give you a few examples The first one is on clouds, and I think what is fascinating is what happened on Friday"

So I have some of my customers that telling me, and I'm talking about the third largest bank in the world, say, we are in rebuilding our data centers. That was before what happened on Friday We are rebuilding them precisely for the fact that they want to have independence from the upper scalers on the cloud and they say no rebuilding them precisely for the fact that they want to have independence from the upper scalers on the cloud and they say nope, you know the price is going to cost us, but this is about our resiliency in the long term And all of the promise that happened from the cloud, yes but it costs a fortune because there are other forces that are imposing, I don't know remember what is the profit margin they must have 60% profit margin, minimum, so today if you run a business and you are at only 20% profit margin, your owner will off-board you will off-board you are in the new financial world. So there are new forces that happen because action means reaction to The second group of people who are making a change, and I think that the second question here are the regulators so you take for example the EU has created recently two acts. There is one is called Dora and that's not the explorer. Another one is Sierra So what this is about? Dora is the digital Operational Residency Act This is only about the financial entities That's a very clever act because what they realized is that the each member state of the EU could not have the asset to measure, understand all the what's really going on with the centralization And they want to make sure that all the financial entities are resilient in the long term. So this is about risk management, contract management, cyber security, and a couple of other things"

They realized that they need to create a second parallel control point on the ICT supply chain And when you read the text, you have an entire set of causes on concentration. With concentration incident concentration and so on and that's not run by the ECB. That's run by the ECB the text, you have an entire set of calls on concentration, with concentration, incident concentration, and so on. And that's not run by the ECB. That's run by the ESAs. They created a joint committee with an overseas framework by which they are going to have a funding to make sure they can control the ICT chain. It's a very subtl construction, I must I have not seen that so far for a long time, but the point is that there are things that are changing because the market reacts to concentration. The resilient problem is becoming bigger and the regulator, some of them start to get in So there may be some different views in the future by which we start to rebalance things. There are plans of interesting side effects from that I could discuss that if you want that are fascinating to look at but that would be my starting point Dirk, you want to talk now?

I think that facilitated the advanced in Silicon. Of course, this is, you know, back and the force mutual enforcement the more power in computing resources the better development of faster development of the new applications And the development of new applications, on the other side really pushed the network device applications on the other side really pushed the network development as well.

So I think we don't really understand all of the incentives that are driving the behaviour and sort of sub-bullet point of three under number one we probably ought to start more some of the longer-term implications of the centralisation because of those incentives thanks any immediate reaction? Can I say? Yeah, okay. Yeah I mean, I've been thinking a bit about this business of where does it go? And it's very clear that if you have, especially looking I've been thinking a bit about this business of where does it go?

I mean, this business of natural champions means yeah they still there but they're not exactly in influential. So what's the next step? What will happen? What will happen probably is that power likes power So politicians like power and they see the power of these big platforms So what's very likely to happen is that they are going to strike the deal so that the power of the big platform is applied in a way that please the local politicians and vice-sever they are going to strike a deal so that the power of the big platform is applied in ways that please the local politicians and vice versa. And that's what we are going to see that's pretty much we're going to see if we don't actually do something about it because the natural trend for example you have okay we see that in regulation like preventing piracy which is actually about enforcing copyright laws and making sure that the copyright orders make money.

Because you are competing and everybody is saying at cost plus something to sustain their operations and investment If you have a monopoly, the game change a lot because you don't have to worry about the competition, instead of selling at the price it cost, you can sell it at the price that customer might be willing to pay So suppose, for example, your baker"

And they're still happy but you're still fed but you are getting much richer than if you did not have the monopoly and the same is true across the world that that's a the reason why the Silicon Valley guys want to invest a big lump of investment to conquer a market because they want to build a monopoly in a segment of the market that they can be like this single baker in town, not the one that have to compete with everybody And when you are competing with them, at best you're getting this 20% margin, so it's really hard So can that change?

You could move the coal by train You could make large-scale industrial smelting where you have adequate, you know, resources and labour You're able to move things around and create massive industry And the small number of folk that realize that became incredibly rich, incredible quickly, and the labor force became incredibly exploited incredibly quickly. And the social ills that were around in America in the 1890s were paramount. Or paralysed and became a political problem the Sherman Act was a counter to the that tried to say eloquently that it's when you're big, the social ills are bad. Just being big is the problem. What you do is also bad, but it's not what you do. It's being big And the Sherman Act was about busting big. Now, big business really did push back"

Ford and Jim rose, massive monopolies went unchallenged in the early 90s those two companies controlled 70% of the global car market. America was happy The rest of the world was not so happy but it persisted no unchallenged. The Sherman Act was never applied The only time it kind of resurfaced again was when the excesses of telephone monopoly became unbearable politically And it was really an American problem. The rest of it was when the excesses of telephone monopolies became unbearable politically, and it was really an American problem. The rest of the world did not get there at that point but AT&T certainly was Oddly enough, when the Americans took on AT&S, it started a global switch to deregulate the entire telephone industry, the largest and most value industry of the late 1970s, early 80s on the planet, employed the most people, was the dominant activity. Ripping it apart sherman act style going it's not really that you gouge customers It's not really that you sit on and actually block technology The problem is you're too big. So let's break you apart and make you small. So we're not going to prosecute your behaviours. We're going to prosecute you for your bigness Tried it again with Microsoft, failed abysmally have been nibbling away at Google, at Facebook failing abysmally. Because in some ways, there learned, as much as the rest of us have learned, that it's more subtle in the way power inserts influence in today's world So how do you respond to that?"

I wish we had a more agile public policy sector that could react Because quite frankly, the way the EU is working nibbling away with punitive fines they're not punitive, they're not behavioural correcting they simply actually encourage more of the behaviour they were trying to stop. So I'm incredibly pessimistic that we know how to respond and the folk who possibly could respond, I don't think they have the tools Because there's one thing politicians really don't like is pissing off voters So banning Facebook tomorrow is not a political answer, no matter what else you might have in your ass arsenal. And therein lies the core of the problem If I may, I would like to be give a different view on that, but fundamentally Joff is right is just that there are tools that may, frankly, who heard about the term theory of harm, a TOH? There are tools that are regulator can apply beyond the big harm just that there are tools that may, for example, who heard about the term theory of harm, a TOH? There are tools that the regulator can apply beyond the big cameras like antitrust law or shaman act or that type of thing It's interesting that they have not used them yet too much and one of the issue as well is that the hyper-scarers learned a lot what happened from the telephony and the AT&T was broken apart. So when they build themselves they build themselves in an intricate way so that if this should happen, it would be much more complete for the regulator to detricote I don't know the term mike english, to untie all of these construction. So it took perhaps what is it, 10 years to deregulate, probably something like this, of the telecom industry? Worldwide it was 25 years. 25 years. So they are betting on the fan that if it takes like even longer than that And you can see all sorts of other attempts, for example, taxation you have the OCD that started to say ah we cannot get"

And I'm sure the lawyers of these big company are doing all what they can to undo this as well but it's not easy and I don't know how again I don't have all the answers but to answer how should societies and market react and maybe bind to the first one, I think there are more things we should study because a TOH is quite interesting object to understand My company just acquired VMware, so I can tell you we've been under that for a year and a half so I've been reading a couple of THOH. These are exante and not exposed as well, so there are a couple of things that matter I can tell you we've been under that for a year and a half. So, I've been reading a couple of THOH. These are ex-ante and not exposed as well, so there are a couple of things that could matter on the legal side as well So again, to back up one, I think we could, first of all, better understand what is the weaponry that governments have Why is it that they have not pressed the button yet? Or was there a deal when they did the OCD? to say, well, you accept the taxation? and we stop continuing the antitrust law? I don't know. But there are things that we are probably not fully aware of what's going on And on the which groups and stakeholders should get engaged? get engaged where we should engage with the regulators and if i if i want to give jump on the next point my point is that the regulators are not here they are in the ITU so the question is and I some people will hate me for that, but do we want to start? to collaborate a bit with study group three in the ITU to go? things perhaps better? information here? I'm just opening it opening it. So we have to wrap up really, really soon, but I still want to give the people in the queue a chance to state their comments or questions. We have"

So I was thinking we could talk about that in terms of like how we should react and which interest do we want to push and I would suggest that some of the interests we should push are the interest of human rights holders Not necessarily corporate rights holders, take care of their interests quite a bit. They pay our salaries and stuff But even Mastodon doesn't allow end users using the platform to choose a license for their posts and they certainly don't let them put a cryptographic signature over the license in a way that would let that, like, would empower them to enforce their copyright interests when, in terms of what's changed research all the big time companies are trying to make AI products out of nowhere in part by literally scrubbing the licenses out of GitHub data, Microsoft So one thing I would say is that, like, we need to, for the sake of decentralizing the internet, decentralize the internet, decentralize the legal control over the information of the internet not just the technical control, but the protocol designers, all of us and cryptographers can help, and as well as the application developers and the user interface designers by making reference applications that empower users to choose their license or even more granular rights as to copyright and to the end-to-end principle get the data out of the middle of the internet and on the ends by in part empowering users at the ends to put copyrights to prevent the big powerful companies in the middle from, and governments from monetizing their data. So I'm curious if anyone has thoughts on the importance of empowering human rights holders by empowering them to choose licenses over their data and make cryptographic signatures before they leave, before they go into the network So he takes 30 seconds.

So until we are able to do that, the problem is that other people understood the theory of design before us and they chose a path for us Now, if you want to try to go to another path from technology, law, ethics, and onto anthropology, which would give us to where you want, unfortunately some people chose the path before us. We could have a chance to do that, but he's going to require a colossal coordinated effort from people to get to the position you want. I'm not saying no, I'm just saying, just be a mindful of Let's move to christopher janz to christopher inacio the queue I just want to comment on you kind of the assertion that Moore's Law is going to end I think yes but no Denard scaling is getting a lot harder, but 3D chips, 3D systems are going to come online, right? I mean, you know, we've already have interposers. We already have systems that do this with chiplets already, and that's going to I think, explode. But that's also going to allow particularly large companies to be able to build combinations of silicon that aren't generally available as kind of catalog parts as what's known in the industry which I think will have, you know, kind of lean towards folks who can build silicon companies that suit their needs a little bit more So I wonder how would you guys change your answer under that? version where, you know, more cost more powerful silicon and then you have the power to invest in your own accelerators and have them integrated might change it? it"

So I think the mic in front of Jeff is not working, but let's go on with jeff because he can't hear. This is Dino I want to make a point about Moore's Law, but I have more important points to make um maybe we shouldn't characterize it as more Law because you're, Jeff, you're looking at it as per unit compute on a single die. I mean, I mean, Elon is building a new model with 100,000 GPUs. So the compute power is increasing. It may not be per unit but these clusters are going to become more and more powerful So I'm not sure the doubling every 18 months on a single die silicon is really an important measurement. But the fact that Jensen at Envidia says that"

So he's creating his own new chart that's going to be a little bit different so having said that then there was a point that Christian made about bread You should never buy a pizza at full price. There's always a coupon where you can get it cheaper. People that don't collect coupons, those are high margin customers for those pizza makers. So the point there meaning is, you can't price things too high or we don't have the decentralized model where humans have power. If you can't sell to a large market because the prices are too high, you're forced to come down just to a point where they can barely afford it. And what's going on in the U.S. now is nobody can afford anything and they're going delinquent on their credit cards. And so it's the banks that are starting to fail so that's that's one point number two how can we solve this problem? You got to follow the money, Dirk. That's all there's to it And why do we have somewhat of an open platform called Twitter slash X? Because there's a billionaire that bought it. If you want the dinar to help, you invite and convince Eli Musk to come here because it's for the good of humanity to do this. And if he, thinks these people aren't capitalists in this room, he may help us. Follow the money Okay. Thanks, Dino. Let's see see Could I go? Dirk?

Okay last question by Raoul What happened was my grandpa? Is that what you want? Yeah, sure A very quick comment about Moore's law. Moore's law was actually Engelbart's law Douglas Engelbart, the inventor of the personal computer His law applied to microprocessor and he had identified that you don't have to just look at the scaling of microprocessors, you have to look at scaling of micro processors, you have to look at scaling of into totality and then see how you're going to come. That changes the situation how that changes the environment So just to put that into context Okay thanks Raoul.
