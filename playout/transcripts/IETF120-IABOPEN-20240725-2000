You can reach I.B at ib.org and has these folks on it.

That's what we're doing now. We're going to have a liaison update from Barry And so what we try to do at every IB open is kind of highlighted different liaison relationship and just learn about what's going on there We have two workshops that are coming up over the next six months and we're going to get an introduction to both of those so that you can learn more about us about what's going to be happening in those workshops, how to get in engaged and how to participate and then we're looking forward to an invited talk about community networks at the end, and hopefully this would be a great opportunity for us all to learn more about what's happening there. Okay All right, so the IV has documents that it works on we have two that are quite mature. That should be coming out as RFC relatively soon. We have the privacy partition document, which is a technical document that we've discussed here before. That's an OTH48 that should be coming out as RFCs relatively soon. We have the privacy partitioning document, which is a technical document that we've discussed here before. That's an off 48, so expect it soon.

So we had a talks about, like, generally, why did range of topics. And the goal of this is to push for an interim meeting. So we kind of gather some topics and do an interim so this worked out pretty well last time. So we had like an interim in February and some of the work we add identified as like was like discussed in the green boff that happened yesterday so it went pretty well so I think that's the model we kind of want to try to follow like do some hybrid meetings once in a while but also try to do most of these things virtually because a lot of the people are not able to attend the meetings. So it'll be it's like works like a really good model and as being green i think it like also helps like that we're doing it mostly virtually yeah All right, and we also have the EDM program which is going to be meeting tomorrow morning at 8 if you want to get up early and join us. We're discussing a draft there that is not formally adopted yet as an IAB document, but we've we've been working on in this program, discussing some print that is not formally adopted yet as IAB document, but we've been working on in this program, discussing some principles and guidance for how to do protocol greasing in general. We have a question yes you've used two acronyms on that slide with no definitions which is completely opaque to visitors.

Okay, now we're about to my slides Mogs relation to the IETF, the, the output of MOG, the goal is to provide a place to talk about the abuse of these systems, of messaging systems, of mobile systems and how malware contributes to this And the output is best practices, documents There are a bunch of those. Information sharing among the MOG members, and that's often very significant because it allows us to talk more about mitigation of abuse and there's a lot of education and outreach for the members mostly So a lot of this is it's all members oriented. And technology transfer, the technology transfer is the part where it relates to the IETF We've had a bunch of things come to the IETF that were incubated in MOG and we bring information back into MOG that they then use in their planning of what best practices documents they write to advise the community So MOG's been heavily involved in things like the email authentication work that we've done in the IETI DCM, SPF, Dmark I personally don't like calling it email authentication, but that's the term that happens to have have gelled for this. Mogg's brought work into other work groups. UTA was a particular notable one.

And that's very true with multiple just as it is with the number of our other really good liaison relationships So IETF work is important to MOG, liaison work involves me taking information back and forth and helping people figure out how to bring work into the IETF, and now I have the involves me taking information back and forth and helping people figure out how to bring work into the IETF, and now I have, you guys have a more formal program to do this now, which is great.

I'll just note that I attend the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium every year, NDSS, which is run by ISOP And they, this year, by far the largest number of paper submitted had to do with AI and machine learning And then when you looked at the little bar charts that they had, the bar charts for AI went all the way across the page And the next one only went like, you know, half an inch or something so anyway AI and they're looking at three aspects of it, abuse that's facilitated by AI systems, abuse of AI systems, abuse of AI systems do bizarre things, and using AI to counter abuse to detect"

Well, yeah, it is You still need to close down port 25 to keep abuse down on your systems. So we updated it And in addition to just making it seem more current, there actually turns out we're a few substantive updates that made sense So we did that Some of them are new things that are popping up Best practice for sending domains. That has to do with email marketing How do you send out your marketing? email to people who really want to receive it and avoid? sending it to people who think it's spam? What are the best practices? for avoiding annoying people? with your marketing? And there's a link at the bottom that's where you can see all the published documents The formal published documents of MOG are public even though the the meetings are not.

Thank you for sharing It's useful update And next up, we're going to go over the workshops that are coming up so I'll invite Mark up. Do you want a drive or do you want? Hi, everybody I'm going to talk about the AI control workshop that we've just scheduled for the IP Next slide, yeah. So there's some interesting things happening in the world as an example in the EU, they had a directive path in 2019, which talked about how people can opt out of an exception for copyright So normally copyright is kind of an opt-in thing. You know, you have to say, I license this to you to allow somebody to use it but for the AI purpose, this directive says, basically we reverse that and you can opt out of that by reserving your right So next slide and that was kind of codified in what's popularly called the AI Act which was just passed recently in that providers of general purpose AI models need to obtain all authorization from right holders if they want to carry out text and data mining over such works And so, next slide, that's just an example but what's happening is, and the suspicion is other jurisdictions are going to do similar things perhaps But what's happening is that AI, crawlers, AI providers are converging on using the robots exclusive protocol or robots. . . . . . which is an IA that AI crawlers, AI providers are converging on using the Robots Exclusion Protocol or Robots. Text, which is an IETF standard as the"

What properties does robots dot text have as an opt-out mechanism for AI crawlers? Next slide And so, for example, if you look at a robots.com text file, you see that it allows you to distinguish things by user agent, so by the identity of the crawler. But there's nothing here that says, I want to opt out of AI altogether. If I don't know the crawler name, I can't really opt out of it. So what mechanism is? there for this use case in robots. text that is amenable to someone confidently saying, I have opted out of AI scraping, for example? Next slide. Furthermore, some people have brought up, this was from some hearings that were held at the Copyright Office in the US. I almost said here in the US Whoops. Yeah was from some hearings that were held at the Copyright Office in the US. I almost said here in the US, whoops. Close enough for my purposes, but I'm far away usually And, and, you know, authors are pointing out and advocates of rights holders are pointing out that you know, this was kind of a land grab that, you know, AI crawlers went out and spider the internet or reused existing indexes of the internet before anyone even knew what this use case was. And so what about their rights? So how does robots dot text apply over time? Does it make assertions about things that, you know, content that was spied to years ago, for example? And that's another discussion to have Next slide And finally, there's a lot of content on the internet that robots .text isn't really amenable to talking about because the actual content creator or rights holder doesn't have the ability to write to the Robots. Text file So, for example, this is a reason, recently very popular social network for some reason, LinkedIn or more popular than it used to be. And the IETF is posted to it, but the IETF has no ability to talk about"

Next slide And so we've spun up a work to have a discussion about this There's a recognition that the, you know, the technical issues here are there, but they're not the biggest part of the work It's more of a discussion between rights holders and people who might want to use AI or people who spot our content for AI, and of course policy It's more of a discussion between rights holders and people who might want to use AI or people who spot our content for AI and of course policymakers. And so we're holding this workshop to have that discussion so we as a technical community can listen to those different parties and start to think about what the requirements are and what the problems based is. Next slide And so it's a workshop we're holding in Washington, D.C because we want to engage with those communities more than we want to engage with the technical community. We're doing it on a relatively fast schedule because there was a recognition that if we don't hold this, soon this year, it's going to get bumped into next year by various events and holidays and so forth and so on. And we really need to have this conversation this year. And so the workshop gonna be held 1920 September, and we've made submissions due on the 2nd of August we're not necessarily requiring to submit a full academic paper we just need kind of expressions of interest and positions so we can understand who wants to come to this thing. It's an in-person workshop and we're going to hold it under Chatham House rule because we identified that a lot of the parties who come to this may have sensitivities about being quoted in public, either because they represent a government or because there are commercial considerations either on the AI side or the rights holder side. And so there will be a workshop report and we'll try and distill all that we hear but we're not going to be identifying individual parties without their project permission. I think that's it Is there another one? No No, that's it. That's it. Thanks. And there's the URL at the bottom So any questions?"

I think it's an important topic Mark, you spoke a lot about rights holder on one side and AI on the other, and I think by rights holders you meant copyright holder. Is that right?

All right afternoon is a workshop about the next era of network management operations. There's a number of people involved both from the IAB as well as the MOT chairs and the Ops ID as well So way back along long time ago, RFC 3535 is actually written about a workshop that was held in 2000 by the IAB about network manager At the time, there was a bunch of sort of competing forward technologies. Where do we go from here? S&P was quite old. COPS was one. Well, should we do stuff over HTTP? Should we use XML? I mean, there was a lot of discussions So in this workshop, came out a bunch of requirements and recommendations sort of, you know, where do we go from here, how are we gonna consolidate? where, what protocol should we use, what format should we use, and we queried a lot of operators at the time, so it was trying to bring together coalesce both operators and protocols engineers to try and get some agreement on sort of, you know, where do we take, you know, managing networks today Is anybody else in this room, were any of you present at that? I actually was. Oh, Rudigar was there. Awesome Yeah, so the people have changed That's clear indication, right?

Prometheus is very popular and things like that. But what came out of the recommendations from 3535, was, you know, XML was in the hype at the time so NetConf was born, pushing it over both SSH and H HTTP with rest, and then Yang is the new data modeling language, which was a deeper structured language than what S&P MIAB and COPS PIB gave you at the time. Next So it's been 22 years. It's time to sort of think about what's new. And so the NMOP working group has recently come up and one of the things that the NMOP group is charged with is to look at these technologies that are in use to manage and configure everything from routers to Nhosts to these days know, these days, you know, wireless light bulbs and all sorts of other things And then figure out, you'll notice at the bottom bullet, I actually refers to 3535. What? should we do? So next slide so it's time to do it again, right? It's time to actually take the big picture approach It's time to look at the full gambit and say, where are we and how do we think? longer term? How do we think, you know, what is? what is our trajectory for trying to get It's a very wide venue, right? Network management is used across all swads of the entire IETF set of protocols from, you know, managing BGP to you know, managing web servers to managing everything So the big picture approach is actually kind of hard, so the IB wants to hold a workshop, another workshop, about that.

Well, can you provide internet? service? No, no, no, we're not an internet service provider ClearSky is a not-for-profit federal agency incorporated corporation in Matt Canada. We were incorporated March 31 2017 In Manitoba there's 63 First Nation communities We're collectively owned by 44 of the 63 And for a community to become a part owner, it's just a matter of filling on a forum, and then they become a part owner of Clear Sky We are the mandated organization by the assembly Madatoba chiefs and that political process took us about four years to complete So we carry the mandate to build the fiber network in addition to that the education and training piece wants the fiber is in place How do they use it?

Respecting the First Nation principles of OECAP And part of that process is having meaningful consultation with the community In keeping in mind that each community is different not only in their technical readiness, but also the side geography, political leadership, and traditional leadership. So it's not only talking to the political leadership for the community, you have to talk to the right people in the community to get the community to support to move the project forward Next slide"

The next piece is the transit so that's the connection from the major urban center to the community. And the third piece being Gateway so typically the connection in the major urban center to the global internet So the ISP, we work with the communities and working with the community we provide them three typical options They can become their own internet service provider, which many communities already have a local internet service provider, so we replace the wireless backhaul with fiber backhaul They could choose to farm it out to a third party and in that case, we work with the third party to provide the service or they could choose which a lot of the first name communities lean towards is kind of a hybrid model where it's branded as a community ISP but in the background, there's another ISP that runs the switches and IP space billing system. But any boots on the ground is done by the any work in the community boots on the ground work is done by the local community themselves. Next slide, please please so build methods These pictures are from a roughly an 80 kilometer fiber build in northern Manitoba As you can see the soil and the environment conditions We install conduit it's essentially a plastic pipe The reason we do that, it provides a clear path to run the fiber through and also minimizes the future replaced costs. So once the fiber is installed, it doesn't have an infinite life. If it's hung on a pole, it has an estimated life at 20 years If it's buried in the ground, it has an estimated life at 40 years"

We're connected in Manitoba, there's, like I said, 63 First Nation communities on reserve population of about 150,000 So some community, a small community, say, two, three hundred say 2,300 people. A large community would be 5,000 people So it's very difficult to make a business case to connect the individual community, which is why we have to rely on grant funds. So the initial grant funds cover the initial build costs and of course the benefits having connectivity in the community the more so the social benefits, you know, health education public safety entrepreneurship Imagine trying to run a business create a business. If you do not have internet, access and say you don't have a computer It's very limited how far you can go and running your business Next slide, please so building in remote areas well there's a short build season, especially from Manitoba We have to wait until the ground is thawed for our, so we can bury the fiber deep enough Typically, that's June. So our build season from June until the ground starts to frost over which is end of October, early November Also some areas are not connected by all season roads. They have seasonal roads So we have to wait until there's 32 inches of ice before we can get the heavy machinery and heavy truck on the ice roads to stage equipment and stage materials for later build later in the hole in the weather gets warmer.

Some funds may cover the hardware at the POP but they do not cover the CPE equipment So we can install fiber and get connectivity at the community, but we can't we don't have funds to install the hardware at the industry homes legal barriers service agreement and partnership agreements working with other entities to be able to provide connectivity to these communities Next slide, please So the well, this is a map of the City of Toronto their fiber map, two major telcos"

Well, the funding monitor wants the fund models want a complete solution so because of the funding models you're left with this situation where you have fiber running to a neighborhood by one telco. Another telco puts in a grant application to provide access to, say, a neighborhood a neighboring you have fiber running to a neighborhood by one telco. Another telco puts in a grant application to provide access to, say, a neighboring, a neighbor or neighboring neighborhood So there's another grant agreement, another funding. So you have fiber on both sides of the same neighborhood, but two different telcos or you may only have one telco that has fiber to your premises and you're limited to who you can use as a service provider based on who owns the fiber as opposed to a shared access infrastructure So if we simply build fiber and it was community owned and everybody has access then the customer would have a choice of who their internet service provider could be as opposed to being limited to who owns the physical infrastructure that runs to their premises So like a road, the internet is for everyone Next slide, please Why fiber? This project actually started 11 years ago-ish under the assembly match Mantoba Chief's health portfolio At the time it was, how do we get more bandwidth to support electronic and medical records?

It was the only technology that could provide sufficient bandwidth to support EMR So the project scope expanded from more bandwidth for EMR to connecting communities with fiber Is there a need or a fit for Leo and other wireless technology? Yes, it is in the plan, but we need the bandwidth for not just internet, but you know, voice services, streaming video, digital radiography cell service, especially with 5G cell service So there is a fit in there for Leo and other terrestrial wireless, but we see it as a backup in case, or when the fiber gets cut, when the communication gets cut, to have the critical communication go over the wireless network Plus with the wireless network, there's distance limitations plus the electronics are exposed to the environment so they have a life anywhere from three to eight years the sweet spot being about five years so there's always continuous replacement cycle for all of us equipment. As opposed to buried fiber, like I said 40 plus years That's estimated. I know in Quebec they actually use 50 years as the estimated life for burying fiber.

That's our technical plan. Well, it's part of our technical plan So we do have the technical plan to connect all 63 First Nation communities in Manitoba both the physical and the logical network design Next slide The financial plan, I think it's pretty sure straightforward. So we're using a we use a 70% subscriber model, so once the community is connected with fiber, we're using that 70% subscriber model in the community we can show that the project operating is a not-for-profit is sustainable, and we can replace the fiber at a 40-year life experience But the big block is the initial build costs So we need the grant funds to do the initial bill, but once it's built, it is sustainable going forward And the First Nation communities all, they short, they have to all work together. So for this to work at all, we need to leverage economies of scale so we need to work with everybody and everybody needs to work together Next slide, please The legal plan items such as, you know, service agreements for transit or access to existing fiber or co-location agreements Community ISP partnerships, you know, in case there's a break fix that needs to be done.

So we kind of look at this here Is there any specific set of problems that you encountered that our protocols haven't kind of helped with? troubleshooting things or anything? Is there something you want to bring to us? as problems? So we do have a place in IRTF that's called Gaia that kind of like could be a place for you to bring any kind of like gaps in our solutions like for the internet protocols that could make things better for you going forward or for another community just like you somewhere else to go forward yeah i'll try to answer your question so i like I said, my last technical certification was server 2012, which I know the government still uses because I'm working, a friend of mine is actually working on a project to upgrade the 2020 server. So I know it's still in use, but like I said, I'm 10 years out of time with the IT stuff. I've been working more on pushing paper and project management management Our entire network design, the longest fiber run we have is about 200 kilometers. I know in I believe it's Ontario, they actually have a fiber run that's 300 kilometers, but that fiber run is for redundancy and resiliency on their network, so it's not the primary connection So, I don't know, maybe technical specs to allow being able to push the signal farther distances where there's no option for power along the whole length From a policy side, dig one's policy So if you're going to open up the ground for anything, walk sewer, putting in new roads, replace bridges, put in conduit I mean, conduit's like five bucks a meter They were spending $1,000 a meter on a gravel road. Add $5.00 conduit. I mean, conduit's like five bucks a meter. If you're spending $1,000 a meter on a gravel road, add $5 a meter for material cost to put in conduit. That'll save us, you know, $60,000 The install conduit is roughly $60,000 a kilometer in these remote areas"

Funding models the funding models need to be more flexible because there's a lot of expenses that are not under eligible costs that we have to source those funds outside of the grant funds, you know, through revenue or some other other means And prioritized not for those funds outside of the grant funds, you know, through revenues or some other means. And prioritize not-for-profit organizations, because connecting these communities, there really is no business case. I heard a presentation earlier where all yeah all the easy problems were solved 20 years ago Well, if there was a business case to connect these communities, the major telcos would do it already would have it would have been done but it's not done. Because it's expensive And we're talking a community of 300 people to 5,000 people. It doesn't make sense for a major telco to build infrastructure there to provide service unless there's a finance incentive for them, but there isn't. So that's why we offer as a not-for-profit. And that's why we separated out there there to provide service unless there's a financial incentive for them, but there isn't. So that's why we operate as a not-for-profit. And that's why we separated out in the three separate business pieces. So the Gateway so there's lots of gateways you know internet exchange points we just connect from there to the transit piece to the community. So the transit's a separate business piece and then you have the internet service provider, which is we work with the local community In Winnipeg, there's actually an internet service provider that is one office building A friend of mine runs space in there, there's an ISP, and the ISP is literally one office building. So all the tenants in there subscribe to that ISP. So it doesn't have to be here I mean it could be very small And it works Thank you. I don't know. Does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. Thank you Thanks, Pete. Totally cool stuff. Absolutely fabulous Three really quick questions. The ownership model of the fiber plant after it's built is the not-for-profit still own it? Yes.

Under the CTI grant, it was last mile builds only So while there's no transit, what are we going to connect to? so it didn't make any sense so then they came out with new grant funds Universal Broadband Fund is the big one now but with the ubf again they're looking for that end to end solution. Where you go to the telcos, okay we need you to build the fiber infrastructure or the wireless infrastructure to provide service to this community. Well, you're essentially creating a monopoly for that community. I mean, the community really only has one choice because you only have one owner of the infrastructure. That's why our model is to separate it out. ClearSky owns the transit and then we don't care who the ISP is. That's up to the community to decide. We fought the same battle locally where I am, and that's a great model, much better than what we came up with. The last question is really simple Don't you guys have permafrost up in northern Manitoba and how do you deal? with that? Yeah, that's a great question So the actually, permafrost is actually really easy to run fiber through. It's actually like cutting butter I mean, I said a rule of thumb, we use 60,000 per kilometer to build Going through permafrost, you could actually do it probably under 40 40,000 a kilometer because you don't have the rock"

The one thing I'm wondering about is, you have this model where the community runs their own ISP. Isn't this a big challenge because you need to train the people with the technical expertise? Are you involved in that as well? Simple, the question is a little bit more complicated, but the simple answer is yes we're involved with that. So the three business models we offer the communities, they become their own ISP Some communities already have a local ISP, so we're just replacing the wireless backhaul with fiber. They could choose to farm it out to a third party. So whoever that third party is, we work with them Or they could choose like a hybrid model or a white label model where it's branded as a community ISP, but in the background somebody else runs it So we help with that negotiation process and in there we build in that so if they choose the hybrid model which a lot of communities lean towards it's built into the agreements that when the community has the technical expertise to run it on their own they can then take over that ISP process or that ISP company and I know it's focuses on internet, but we're talking the transit so internet's one service cell phone, voice, television computer radiography, I mean, the list goes on and on and on So transit has multiple uses. Yeah, maybe too sure if you can answer that question, but to go one step further, is there also barrier by these communities to maybe use the internet?

That's it. The high school I went to had a catalog of 110 credits. So I could take something like grade 12 physics. Well, grade 12 physics is not offered in First Nation because it's not part of the core To be hired by Manitoba Hydro Telecom, you have to have grade 12 physics to get into some university programs, you have to have, you know, like grade 12 physics chemistry, bio. So as you have people that come out with the community to go to higher education, while they're all already behind their peers because they have now they have to go back to high school to take these other courses to get into university Right. Thanks. Thank you you All right, I think that is the end of our queue. And the end of our main agenda here. So thank you again, Bill. I think this was really insightful and fascinating to hear all the different things that you're doing, and this is really great"
