I did steal a slide from 1 sixteen, so face masks are not required. I'm Glenn Dean. I'm one of your co chairs. This is David Lawrence. my my my other cochair, Eric, would you like to say hello? You are our our esteemed area director, And we have a very short agenda for today. Can you read that? Okay. So so We have the first thing I do, we we've we've got the general setup We've got the welcome to the chairs doing, and we have the scribe all set up to go. So we don't have to bake or scribe today. Thank you, Scribes. It's awesome. It's awesome. Internet. Tim and editor gonna do it? Okay. And then so The I just discovered. I was just informed there are 2 working group last calls that I put into the data tracker. and I thought the data tracker then sent an automatic message to the list. It didn't. So we will be extending these calls by 2 weeks I will get that sent up to the list. and I will learn how to use the tool fairly because I was pretty sure it sent a note to the list when you you moved it to the workgroup plus call state, but we'll get that fixed. So just add 2 weeks on absolute August 3rd. And that's when we'll close both those calls. We have a very short agenda today, so we have one draft be presented by Dan, Dan Wang. Wing. Wing. delegated credentials to host encrypted DNS folders on CPEs. We need to work on the short end of these titles. They're getting too long. Alright. Dan, Kamada."

I'm Dan Wing, and this is delegated credentials to host encrypted DNS forwarders on CPE. next slide. So what we're trying to do is get local CPE to to support encrypted DNS. so that we can get all the usual features out of a localized DNS resolution on the local network. But we run into a couple of problems trying to do this. those are at the bottom. One is and CA sign certificates difficult to get. We'll talk about that. little bit more detail on another slide. And The let's let's move on to another slide. That sounds good. So DDR and DNR are nice approaches. A problem with DDR though is the the ISP's propensity to change IP addresses rotate IP addresses means once we get one that is signed, it may change. We don't know when that's going to occur. And when it does occur, when we do get the the public IP address changed, we need to go off and fetch a new certificate. And during that time, we can't offer encrypted DNS to the local network."

    "text": "which kinda blows. We also, of course, can't get a signature for a 192 private address the same problem with v Six. DNR works with FQDN, which is cool. We can go get names and and the i ISP managed CPE operator Could have serial numbers or account numbers or something and generate unique FPDNs for each one of their CPE, and that works alright. But in deployment, it was found with lets encrypt that they don't like serving out that many FQDNs signing that many FQDNs in in a 1 fell swoop. And then renewing them comes up with a similar sort of problem So this is where we we poked around at how else we might solve this other than talking to a CA for every single CPE. Next slide. And then the last problem that I didn't talk about yet, which is that the CPE are often unavailable and unplugged kind of a small problem because once they're plugged in, they can go and and gets you know, go and and Talk to DMS, talk to a CA or talk to the CPE Management system and get some things. But it is It is a problem, and delay is providing that encrypted DNS. Next slide, please. So the two mechanisms we investigated for this and and we chose subsurts because of the the pros and cons that it has. are subsurts and name constraints. So name constraints has been around for along a while, requires CA support, but there's very few CAs that support it. and not a lot of implementations that we were able to find Subcerts on the left doesn't require CA support, which is nice. There's a small change to the TLS"

    "startTime": "00:08:00",
    "text": "client and server that are needed, they have to send a a new TLS extension that But what's nice is that's out of the out of the cryptography necessary for TLS. So it's just in you know, it's in the handshake and and not in a scary part of modifying TLS. And there is some client support. So Firefox supports this today. And I saw that the the Facebook homepage supports it as well. So kinda cool. There is existing implementation experience with it. not in exactly where we need it, of course, but there's the full rotation experience, better than nothing. Next slide, please. So this is this is the high high level view of how this would work. When the CPE is plugged in and comes up, it talks the managed CPE service. So oftentimes, the ISP that the CPE is associated with, but it doesn't need to be the ISP. It can be a separate service that, you know, ASUS, NETGEAR, whatever. operate as a side effect of you purchasing an ASUS or NETGEAR security enabled box thing, and it talks to the managed CPE service gets the delegated credential brought down, and this is what to the TPE, and this is what avoids having to talk to the CA. And then that is what's presented locally to the encrypted DNS client. and that means the encrypted DNS client The the blue box is everything in the in the home or in the managed, you know, in the the local network. And it means the encrypted DNS client needs to support the delegated credential for this to work authentication to work, so it knows it's talking to that CPE. validates that and then moves forward. and that's it. Chris, Chris, Russian I am ready for questions. Hey, Tim. You're you're out the mic. I don't think it needs, but you're at the mine. What's that?"

Okay. because I was So I work for a US cable company. we will never give they never give out FQDNs to to CPEs. So it's like they'll do, like they'll do it for pointers, but not for it's like, let's not talk about that. But can you run your own private CA? because we have our own, like, CPE devices that we may be build with other you know, vendors and stuff. And I could see us running something as sort of our own sort of custom CA to give these out, but problematic. Yes. No. you know, I guess, doing sort of internal CA's and sort of Alright. It's so So here's a problem. Yeah. And, also, we're doing a lot of dual stack now. stuff now too. So I I I need to go read how if there's that that's gonna affect what you guys doing, but I don't think you will. Right? So we don't care what's going on with the CA, which would be to the right and off of this diagram. It it's out of scope because it it doesn't need we don't need any features from the CA. if it's a private CA, That that's cool. that Ben Schwartz, Meta, So I I think if anybody has implemented DNR in a client today, then This draft is a nonstarter. If nobody has implemented DNR in a client yet, then maybe this draft has a chance. Because if anybody has implemented DNR in a client today, and hasn't also implemented Square for delegated credentials then they're going to you you have created a situation where that client walks onto your network connects gets a DHCP to DNR or however or our ADNR or whatever. and then attempts to connect, gets a TLS handshake failure, presumes an attack and drops the connection, which means it has no DNS service on this Oh, great. Great. So"

    "startTime": "00:12:01",
    "text": "I I think that we needed to sort of answer that question, and decide if this is basically, we have 2 options if you wanna be able to do this. one of them. is to update DNR really fast. I guess it hasn't it doesn't have an RC number yet. yank it back from the RFC editor and try to modify it. And the other is to define some kind of extension so that you can that has to be or basically define a new DHCP code point and a new RA code point to say, like, okay. This is DNR, but it does require support for delegate credentials. So if you don't recognize it, you have you can you'll just ignore it. Alright. because otherwise you you have this better case. Yeah. avoided talking about it in the presentation, but in the draft is a small section which I I don't like on how to deal with exactly that problem. And it and it kind of hand waves, I would say, at Duquilas SSL and and basically some other sort of fallback mechanisms, all which kind of bring in all the problems that I talked on slide 3. Yeah. In in particular, I wanna the reason that I I think this is especially important to focus on is that I don't want us to sleep walk into the situation where this is deployed, and there you know, therefore, situations where this incompatibility is happening. because in that case, what will inevitably, I think, end up with is that the clients will have to take sort of a soft fail approach where they They've used DNR. They've done the TLS handshake. They've gotten a failure. they they're, like, certificate validation failure and or whatever. And then they can't afford to actually break. And so they'll they'll have to come up with a soft failure. And if the client, if we're encouraging clients to have these very soft failure modes, then we're reducing the security that this whole system offered in the first And that that's a good point. there's already enough pressure for soft failures to occur. I mean, yes, I recognize there's already already a lot of pressure"

I agree with the point Ben was making I don't think You wouldn't we would we should necessarily go with, like, pull DNR back or that we would really require new DHCP and RRA code points my initial impression is could we not instead here define a parameter for the SVcb parameters and make that mandatory we think it's gonna break such that new client like, old clients would just fail to parse it if they don't understand that there's, like, This thing used delegated credentials. You're you're right. The mandate the SBCB mandatory parameter saves us again. Good design on that thing. So that that was one comment. And then just around the document itself, it's not just reading through it, scanning through it. it's not clear to me which part of this as it's defined as, like, a standard tracking? Like, is the normative spec here it talks about, you know, there's DDR and DNR. It talks about delegated credentials. But as far as putting them together, it actually I couldn't find, like, To to clarify, like, this only works for DNR, Yes. This will only work for DNR. Okay. So I think it'd be good to spell that out. I don't know a ton. I haven't looked into the delegated credentials. much in detail. But right. I'm I'm assuming there's nothing we could do to have it kinda dynamically include coverage of the IP that it has so that DDR would work We probably I I don't know. I have to look at that. Yeah. guess I I would be curious. I mean, DDR does leave it somewhat open to say that"

So it would be interesting to see if we could have something we're able to sign in here to say that, yes. Like, at at this moment, that IP address you're getting is also somehow fine Okay. And, Eric, your next before you do that, I will ask you to please refrain from high fighting This is a very serious working group, sir. And I saw that high 5. You you guys did back there. Since since Tommy Ruth, one of the or already address one of the things that's gonna raise. The on. Like, I think there's a need for this. I also say if we can find a way to get the to deal with the IP address, sir, the case here for the other mode that would be nice just because in starting kind of in the he's starting to play with this on that slide. That's also turning out to be as pence, or more painful than we already expected it to be, and that was already painful. gonna be a problem. But the I may for the CPE case, I'm wondering if this is one word worth also thinking at bigger picture of whether there's a better like, a more general solution for this. because I think this is one that I keep saying over and over again is whenever people wanna run kind of Trust trust your TLS within their within kind of their home network environment. we don't have a good solution there. and having a kind of we can one off adhere to get something out there's still gonna be a lot of other cases where it'd be nice to not have to keep what kind of having I think about that every time I connect to my stupid printer and my stupid a one off leash. mass and my stupid 19216811 router. and I get a certificate challenge and Yeah. That'd be awesome. And it's clearly it's kind of clearly outside of the it's like on as far outside the charter of ADDD as you can get, but it would be also nice if like like"

It wasn't just specific to this particular I would love to work on that. guess. That would be awesome. And and maybe this is a step Ben Schwartz, Meta. I I wanna second that. As an example, we just mentioned that maybe you need a new mandatory, service bindings parameter. you know, that probably is a totally general purpose parameter. It's not DNR. configuration. It's like delegated credentials required. that could be applied anywhere even on the web. and the But the the flip side of that is that the reason those cases have proven so hard is because it's very difficult to reason about the security properties of a certificate whose private key is 2 feet from the from the client. You know, with whom you have you know, ideally, a good a good trust relation ship. Ideally, they are the the person, the relying party, but also they could be the attacker. Right? So if you put one of these delegated credentials onto a box in my house, then I can probably extract that Deligrade delegated credential. and you know, and now impersonate this thing and knows, you know, what kind of interesting situations that that creates. Right? So it's in a sense this it begins to look like an abuse of the CA system, an an abuse of the PKI. and I would I'm not saying that's a show stopper, but I'd like to see some some very thoughtful analysis and some some broader security expertise on Okay. On that question? Okay. Cool."

We do have a few minutes if anybody wanted any general discussion They bran wanted to bring up to the microphone about the working group or anything else. going on in ADD. Go in once. Are you coming up, Tommy? Yeah. my thing disconnected. So I'm not gonna actually get in queue. Tommy Poly Apple. since You know, Ben was raising the question about implementation for DNR. So so you know, DDR, I think, you know, people have implemented in that and there's a bunch of resolvers supporting that On the DNR side, that's something that we do not yet have deployed on our platforms. I'm not aware of any other clients that are currently running that in production, And I'm also curious about routers that are actually supporting that. So it would be good to have some conversation with the people here about, like, intent to implement and interrupt testing it's been difficult far for me to find, like, okay. because, you know, there's something off the shelf I can easily test with to say,"

So to clarify, you're suggesting something near term or something like a hack thumb thing in frog. Yeah. Yeah. It could be a hackathon in frog. That would be a fantastic thing to kick off and just say, hey, everyone. Like, let's actually make this happen. Or if if there are people already who have that and are willing to you know, make boxes available that'd be great. it is certainly, you know, trickier to test dnr without kind of all the parties getting together as opposed to, you know, DDR, you know, once quad 8 and quad 1 did it, it's easy to just configure yourself to hit those and test it out end to end. If I can make a suggestion, I mean, implementation is a little bit outside the scope of the working group, but not entirely. A lot of working groups -- Yep. Yep. -- help foster the hackathon work. Yeah. So so I think that's a great idea. I was also gonna suggest that maybe if you wanna kick off a note to the EDI list EDDI because it is the encrypted DNS deployment initiative. And -- Sure. -- hackathon or and and pointathon testing might be a really good thing for that. that that community. And it gets a bigger community than the people are doing the spec development in this room. Yeah. I guess, I mean, as a question to the people in this room, are is there anyone who would who would participate in a hackathon for that that we know of here. and and Ben already conveniently ran out the back of the door. He's gone. So me take care is not letting me in, but Do do you wanna go to Andrew first, or I'm I was gonna respond on the question. Tell me us.

Okay. Alright. What I'm hearing is that we need some discussion on lists And I'm gonna suggest we we blasted the both lists because it'll get a broader audience of people that might that might be able to sign up and say, I've got implementations running.
