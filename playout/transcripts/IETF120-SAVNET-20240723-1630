And prefixes will the same subnet tag of the facing subnet will be added into the allow list In this example, Router A and Rort B connects to subnet 1, so they will generate spam messages for Subnet 1, and since the spam message to each other After integrating the spam messages of Route A, and Route B, they can generate a prefix allow list at interface 1 and 2"

We do not have a specific piece of terminology that I have found in the working group yet about this A non-goal for this presentation or the mechanism is to talk about how we actually calculate the SAP tables for the devices, as we've seen in prior presentation there's many discussions about how we gather these things, how we determine the level of trust about the data and these are going to be a difficult note conversation separate from how do we actually program these things. And there are circumstances where a service provider may wish to actually leverage source address validation absent any of these mechanisms, maybe strictly by provisioning so the operation model that is being proposed in this document is that interfaces and fording elements, and I'm using the word fording elements separate than routers because the devices that may be doing the stuff could be a switch, you know, firewall. It may not be anything that normally would speak BGP, but no, BGP is just the way to shove the data into it. And the data that were passed is basically the information to provision, what we generally call, a SAV table. The distinction in the document here is this is not a single, large, no, table for the entire device. This is really individual sub-tables that are applied to interfaces And the interfaces get the tables, you know, provided by membership. There are four classes of membership that's being proposed in here the first one is that some of the membership might be for a specific interface in the network. There's may be a membership that is a subset of no interfaces. You could call this a group, an interface set. The terminology, you know, probably evolve as we continued discussions For most of our inter-domain cases, two common memberships know will be useful, which is I am having membership based on this is attached to a given pure AS.

And we have a simplified no table here I'm not talking about enforcement direction, and I'm not talking about the traffic enforcement. These are things that have very good discussion already across the working group. This is strictly talking about how we get the state around the network So, routers one and two, have interfaces ADNC and know the expected no SAV table for the prefixes is listed on the right hand side Example of an interface specific memory could be used to populate each of these things. So as an example, you know, prefixes one 3, and 4 might be enforced at interface A Maybe we actually say that, well, uh, interfaces B and C are part of a group that would receive 2 and 5. So the controller, actually has been configuring this and stuff to this group, and two and five is what you're up for period ASs, we see that we have, you know, ASF 100 and 200 is adjacent OASs and perhaps we're telling the controller, to distribute things to devices that have tables attached to these ASS's four sets of prefixes say two and five and our final case, you know, origin ASS is, you know, we see the no primarily for origin validation we see this isn't say two and five.

Now, anybody's familiar with BGP layer 3D? VPNs is going to find this a sort of familiar analogy We're basically creating a new affi-safi. You know, it BGP to pass around SAV enforcement state The NLR that's proposed in the document is a very simple thing. It's a route distinguisher and a prefix Prefixes know for SAV enforcement may be present in a significant number of hoarding elements across the network. So the consequences, now using the groups, we need a way to actually be able to distribute things potentially to a large number of interfaces, groups etc. The various types of memberships we just discussed And this means that a single BGP packet may not be able to contain all the memberships And we do actually see this for layer 3dpms as well So the proposal here is that the route distinguisher allows us to actually say this is the originating device, you know, it's four octets, and we're using a B2B2 identifier, and we have two bytes worth of space to be able to say, you know, these are, you know, this prefix is present more than once, map it in there Again, you know, we sort of know what these things look like from there three PPNs And very similar to layer three VPNs, how do we actually take this membership and put it inside of it? BGPPDU? For layer 3 VPN, we use extended communities that contain route targets.

It's just a, you know, AS number that's embedded inside the community. You already know what this looks like from their 3 VPNs The thing that's being proposed here that allows this group style membership to scale out, the layer 3 VPNs can happily be deployed, you know, full mesh, you know, IBGP, they can be deployed route reflectors hierarchies of route reflectors, controllers, etc But when you're using BGP, especially in a large reflected environment, you need a mechanism that allows for device to say, I'm only interested in things that are local A given layer 3, no VPN router, may have one or two VPNs attached to it. It doesn't want to see a thousand VPNs worth of data A SAV enforcement device may or may not want to see a large or small number of routes depending on what the role is and what it's attached to We see this in all the presentations. Once you've calculated the state, it's going to be wildly disjoint as to how things show up don't send everything everywhere the control needs to know that. The devices themselves only need their local data. R.T constraint RFC-484, does actually have a mechanism to provide, you know, in a sense, a subs subscription. This device has these local targets, or in this case, SAVT members that it's interested in. And this will build a BGB distribution graph to send only the things that are of interest.

For the topology, in question, this is the enforcement topology that we're generating state for The table on the right is the only thing that's actually being conveyed in the protocol. But in order to compute the table in the controller, it needs to know for example if you have feasible path or lose URPF PRPF, the controller, the computation, they need to know as an input what are the different updates that are being received at the routers, not their best part, but all the updates. Yes, and as I put in, you know, slide number three a non goal is how this state is actually gathered. That is a separate matter from the installation of the state. I completely agree this is a necessary thing, whether or not these mechanisms for gathering the components and disingling the components go into the same AFISC affy-safi. I don't have strong opinions about that. I believe they probably will end up being separate But as an example, Barsav could be used to poppy this table at the controller. And you know, the controller then signals in the, the SAV enforcement state. Okay, I will talk some more details later. Okay. Thank you Hi, hi, Li bing liu from Zhongguyenlap. Two questions. The first one is that you say to characterize different membership groups according to the potential in coming directions of the previous Is it right? Correct So it's four different types of groups. The intention of the groups is to say that for this logical SAV table,"

So in this case, it is not a highly dynamic mechanism. You know, the subscriptions are to some extent managed but the memberships themselves could be and this is one of the reasons why I'm leaving the details, unanswered right now, it is possible for this mechanism for the membership to be dynamic discovered from attachment point, potentially to some of Shurams points, if we happen to know from local B2B procedure, maybe supplemented by a additional provisioning protocol that the customer cone is no one specific thing, this mechanism potentially can just simply add itself dynamically to its subscriptions for enforcement you know bar BIRSAF doesn't talk about how do you attract missing data as an example. This is a mechanism by which that could be done Yeah, Jeff, they match the time discuss on the list. Okay, thank you for your application thank you for the time Hello, good morning, everyone"

As we know, Sao Zhu can be considered a a couple of source prefix and valid or invalid interface set wen lin the architecture, it's mentioned that we can use some management tools to first facilitate the source-address validation to have installed our rules And the BGP spec is a convenient tool to do traffic filtering and controlling so here I will introduce a use case to use BGP flow spec to help installs such rules. And existing flow spec extensions can also be used to improve the efficiency of such install such as inter site, we can group interfaces so that we can reduce the overhead of full control plane. Next, please Okay, here is the use case It's one of the use cases Here, let's focus on this figure uh we have a controller and in the local as we have three rotors and two of the rotors with blue color, have been deployed south-net mechanisms and in the orange rotor south-net mechanism is not deployed We still use the traditional or existing sound mechanisms.

And the source address validation can be enhanced by installing X external saw rules for example, if we, when we use exists, SAW mechanisms, we may not be able to get the complete set of invalid source prefixes and we can use Bd BG flow spec to help complete the source prefixes on the rotor the rotor so then the orange rotor can do a more accurate source prefixes filtering Okay, let's use case and about it can do a more accurate source prefixes filtering. Okay, that's the use case. And about how to generate south rules in do a more accurate source prefixes filtering. Okay, that's the use case.

So SISP is an option that proposes a public idea registry that contains all the AISs that both want to deploy something and are willing to set up a software-nair appearing relationships So we hope that are newly adopting AS can use this registry as a reference and picked appropriate AS is to set up a peer relationship to exchange science specific information. And because RPC is already a global infrastructure for routing security, we believe that this is the most suitable choice So the SISPA object is necessary for automatic appearing. On the right, there's a, and here's an example, and we the most suitable choice. So the SISP object is necessary for automatic appearing. On the right, there's a, and here's an example, and for AS4 and AS1 to generate the accurate stuff sub-block list or allow lists they need to set up connections with other software agents and using the SISP object, it can identify or the appropriate ASS to set up the period relationships to exchange the necessary information to set up all the lists So this is the second time we have presented this job draft and in the last IETF meeting we have received some comments on our first version"

And the second comment is on the SSVE content and we were asked to extend the object to cover both IPV4 and V6 address families And we also want we also would like to extend the object from only one address to a list of addresses because an AS can have many South NAC agents. And last we have some comments on the appearing establishment algorithms using SISP We are asked to illustrate the exact algorithms and also want to show the appropriate amount of information needed for newly adopting AS. And finally, we want to make sure that the aspect is not bidirectional in our current text So based on the comments, we made some modifications to our current draft draft Here are the main updates. First we revised the content type section to include the suggestion to include the suggested and we are going through the process trying to register this code point and secondly we revised the CISPEE content section too, so that the AS1 module can cover both IPV4 and VSE address families and also a list of IP addresses for AS. And thirdly, we revised the session 6, which is using system with some considerations for its establishing a peering relationships using SISP as well as detailed procedures for establishing such a relationship.

The first step is to identify all the ASS in the preferred AS passes to various destinations and rank them in the frequency according to their frequency in a descending order The next step is that we retrieve the SISB object and obtain all the candidate ASs and these AISs which have deployed South NAC and the third step is that we want to find select the appearing candidates based on their rankings, based on all the candidate AIS we found in step two.

For disclosing, Savety client users testing data for research use only and discloses data with user's permission SubT can test many dimensions, many different dimensions of source address validation like private addresses routable addresses, and it can test the direction of source address validation that is the inbound and the outbound. So it can also test IPVAR addresses and IPV6 addresses and Saferty can test the spoofable prefix lens And this is how does Safari work and very many we mainly do four tests that is outbound moving test, inbound spoofing test, trace route test, and trace filter test and there are some details of how does safety work and I think I was, I think I skip this section and this this is how does Savti disclose measurement results and first of all Safati will only disclose outbonds source address validation data on users' current data on users is how does SAVTI disclose measurement results.
