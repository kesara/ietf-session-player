My co chairs are, Jaime Jimenez and Kirsten Borman, And before getting into the core of the core session. Huge congratulations, Jaime. For the new addition to the family and of course, and thanks for bringing in new later directors, working group chairs, media takers, whenever. Thank you so much. The switch is q. Thank you. Okay. People today are assumed to have read the drafts, including the agenda, our goal to to make a good use of our time to discuss, issues and open points business in a civilized way. The attendance list is compiled automatically by Miteco I'll keep a look at the chat. Today. We had, you know, takers, Christian and Rick you so much for helping, Jess. We also help And, of course, this is an officiality of meetings, so do not well applies. Please get familiar with that if you're not already. It's not only about IPR patents and so on. It's also and especially about our code of conduct. So please be nice and professional with one another. A few practicalities. We've been recorded, and for the in person participants, remember to sign in with Miteco, preferably with the on-site tool. You can find the link on the cracker and the screenshot in this slide.

This is the quiet packed, agenda 1st day we'll continue with this chair slot for a while with updates on the working group and the documents. Then we have custom leading two slots, one on the remaining documents of the Qualcomm cluster and 1 on the HF document on cri's. Then Martina leads, a slot on 2 documents DNS over coop and, newly released related coordinate in our Christian list this lot on cooperative communication, and we had 2 versions, released since I TF1, 18. And escrow presents an update on the new working group document about group communication for cope with proxies. And then Rico has, two slots related to score, 1 and a score capable proxies, and 1 on 2 documents on updating, key material or identifiers, for Oscar. And then we conclude the number of slots on individual submissions too bad by Christian or up nontraditional responses, and on.

Corcede was also, approved recently, and in the ether queue, not stuck just, under the regular process. As far as I know. And it's anyway on today's agenda in the Qualcomm slot.

We have a number of documents, in the, white post working robust call processing, one is, group of score on its version, 21 now. Is still, waiting for a shipper right up and the latest version, did address the comments from the shepher that have supposed to be confirmed and then we are really waiting for the write up. So we are on Kristen's hands for that. Then we have the 2 remaining documents from the core cluster that Krastin will cover, on today's agenda. Komai, that underwent a number of updates more are expected before, a next working with Plus Gold, young library, technically is waiting for Shepard up, but it's been put on for a while waiting for Koma to be a pretty much completed.

It's a text based format. So there are still things like IP addresses or time of date Springs, that that are represented as tech strings in in Jang's Hebrew.

So this this is, the upcoming So on to the the main point here, Koma, as I said, this is based on on Yang Sibo and on the it. Management.

And, 15 is, this session about potentially having further parameters then then We work for constrained devices, but this may also be something that we leave to a future extension. So we have to understand that. Basically, the the current idea is that With constrained implementations, you also have a somewhat limited information based. So it it's okay not to have these filter parameters like, depths in but maybe the reality is that these information basis are growing and, and the need for these filters is is increasing. But then dev doesn't really work that well either. So just copying it, it's is probably not not the full, answer here. That's why this is an an ongoing discussion. So the the, plan is to get those remaining comments that I just talked about addressed and get all these examples made which are always a bit of a chore because, they're they're hard to test with the with the software we have right now, And, that will lead to a dash 15, and we probably will do working group last call that that's Kumar?

But this uses the co op encoding and would be nice to have a seaborne encoding for that as well. So that that's why we are working on CIs, and we are also trying to to increase the coverage. No. Funly, one thing we didn't actually do before this version 14. Was actually describe how to to to, translate between the the co web representation of your eyes and the CLI representation of of your information. So this is a a new section and we did other minor things like, doing a techno notation way of talking about CFCIs, which you don't need, but makes life easier. And, that there are a couple of chores that have to be done. We definitely need more chest vectors. We, decided to make the scheme registry non negative because COAP In co co op only supports, no negative numbers, on-site numbers, and so far we had made the registry out of negative numbers, and we will switch this into a positive excuse me, non negative numbers."

So this, more slides and each of these. So this is essentially just the the option structure that's opaque from the point of view of COVID, but of course, it's a cbo encoded, CI. And, yeah, we had to define what happens when you put in both proxy URI, I am proxy CI. And, the proxy scheme number, needs to be an unsigned integer because cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, we cannot, coat anything, but unsigned integers. Could, of course, made this, into a seaborne encoding, but that's really not needed. So we decided to go for unsigned integer URL scheme numbers.

Basically, the only change since, the last IETF in Prague is that we added some references to the relevant service B and TNR RCs in and our own draft, which I will talk, later on. And so, basically, most of the deliverables that we were asked atitfone 118 for the working group last call. Were fulfilled. There was a question of implementations. There is our Python and dry it implementation and There's also a bachelor student of ours who's working on an implementation in unbound. My question would be if there are more implementations by the working group, maybe. Apparently, not. Okay? And then the other Okay. And then the other deliverable was that we were supposed to provide a problem statement regarding service bindings, which became the draft I will present in the remainder of the talk.

Yep. So people know which parts I covered. Thank you Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So regarding resolver discovery, so the current land landscape is set for all the DNS over HTTPS still as quick there is this discovery of designated resolvers short DDR, defined in RC, 9462. Which uses basically service b records, definition from the 2 preceding, RCs. And there is also, discovery of network dated resolvers, short DNR, which is, specified in RC 9463. Which uses DHCP and data advertisement options and uses a reuses the server service parameters from the service b records. In these options. And this basically looks like this. So We have these 3 message types, DNS service b records, ipv6 route advertisement options and TSCP V6 options. Where we have basically a lot of overlap between the fields.

So we also registered some for DTLS, which is now AAPN equals coat. Then we also need some way to identify a transfer protocol beyond TLS and CLS, which is, the co op transfer key and in Christians talk. I'm sure he will also talk a little bit about that. And then for Oscar and ace, We also needed some keys. We defined them also in the draft of course, we needed an equivalent for the DOH pass. So, some dock pass is also needed. And so, yeah, and for the, authentication domain name, do we wonder when it would if what this would be for Oscar and So at the moment, we decided to either have no name if we don't want authenticate and maybe future proof for some CI style authentication was ad hoc.

I'm just wondering whether we we want to this into one bucket with 3rd Vietnam. Because maybe it's not so useful without that. Well, you can use it without the NS Over Corps being discovered, you have to just configure it manually, of course, Yep. Christian Yeah. I I agree that the the the discovery options for for COB over details. I think we fixed the one or 2 items that are missing there. So those could just be used the large work for for DNR is about integrating this with as a token or score. I think this will take a bit get a might take the larger part of the of the remaining year.

The the problem I see a little bit with this is set the DNS of club. Discovery It is DNS over detail co op over detail s discovery. Is not just something that you might want to do with, with with only DNS of a COGS. So you also may might want to discover some service binding for co op over details. So I'm not sure if if Doctorft is, right place to perhaps this So I would rather maybe if if we want to go for a head with having some form of DNR already defined and then later work on at work. Divide that part of the work so that you have, co op over details, discovery draft, and then, quab over Oscar, ethoc, discovery draft. What document? Good to me. So we could still accelerate the the GTLS side where where we know how to do things, and, work a little bit more on on the Edok Sy Elskarside. Okay.

Without introducing new URLs for everything, without introducing additional cost per request. And this should also work well with proxies. What I'd like to focus on today is how this is addressing the the the whole on session. I follow-up, Kops, Kim, versus Kuppo or TCP scheme issue. So what we've talked about during IETF 118 is that, the the what the historical background is for for why those are different. Being that with IP led roles, you just can't distinguish otherwise what the protocol is. Whereas the observation from the t to t achieve meeting in in Prague was that actually everything that is not, IP that that does not contain IP literals or or DNS resolution before sir, service fee records. Would just work with the single scheme. So that is now, and that is one of the changes, in the latest versions of the document also recommended for new transports. We it's possible and describe and document how to use, the co ops scheme for multiple trans for for all for new transports. With some caveats, and those caveats, kind of depend on the history list.

They are using transports that are not IP based, but that have their own addressing human, we won't run into the issue of and port could be, a UDP port or TCP port there. This is really, ITF's tech specifically. The document now has guidance on on what to do in that case. But following up on those guidance might not be trivial. So that those those appendices that describe what should happen in that case. I'll I'll I'd like to ask for good working group review on that and input for for how to make those better. The other changes are are more on the editorial side, especially on the transports of the security guidance, mainly profited from removing support for for more cornerish cases. So when there is trans supporting when there is, transport layer security around certain optimizations are just now not described as possible, which vastly simplifies the security handling. So what's what's left for going forward? Because I think that the that the, parts where we need to process The input that has come from from the larger IETF. With all this SBCB stuff. Is now in a rather good shape. So we can look at what is left. Outside of that. There's one long standing item about how we describe which your eyes this is applicable to."

But looking at how things work in HTTP with more focus on the origin, that may just be the simpler way, both in terms of implementing end and tracking in terms of tracking it and also in terms of of wording it. So I think it would be a good idea to make the switch. But there are pros and cons for both. So I'd like to hear your opinions if anyone has any right away, that can puzzle pause here. Seeing nobody, run to the queue while continue. Relatedly, there is the question of how are descriptions in our in our C6694. We'll have best best handled when a device says, hey. I do have some long term stable name, even though you're contacting the overrun short lived, for example, link local address I want to advertise both, how do I phrase that best in 6 to 690? I have no strong preference which direction we go, but as this document is approaching completion, we should make a choice. We could also say that we don't think that 66.90 started covery is not relevant, but then again, we, the possible successor coral is a bit stuck because I didn't get to make much progress in that over the last year.

That is just more compact, but would need some elaborate reasoning 2 to to reach up to Reconodicalize what this actually means those mental hoops we have to jump through will just go away we're not using 6690, and they are not technically hoops to jump through. So an implementation can just be referenced slash food and and work with that. Yeah. So do do you have a preference on on on which of those versions to To focus on? I probably would have to look at a few examples of this. So the last part, the last of the open question is is what precisely to do with your appendix. So there are, and just jump back briefly because it's more illustrative there. There are 2, appendices. One is filed. How to use SVP records or service parameters for coop.

So we don't need it immediately. How do we how how can Do we need to phrase that here? And if so, with which automation because we have core plus TCP. We can express things. And the other question is that, if someone wants to express literals, where do those service parameters by the way, I'm not really defining here, but importing from, the draft, which can with the split we agreed on a few minutes ago be simplified we do those go when we have a URL, and that appendix is a bit of a mess because it's introducing something out of necessity, 10, 10, I think the way it does it is kind of usable, name, but it's just a it's really just a strong draft.

It would be preferable to test this with something where, the process are automated in the co op library, but that is currently not planned for a IO co op. So interrupt testing would mainly be about particular applications using this and I don't have an immediately obvious example. We're trying to grade that. Yeah.

And the idea is that through the proxy, clients can basically reach a group of co op servers and gets the responses, the individual responses remotely surface, relayed back to itself And this should also support some of the different types works instead. That can be defined, you know, using co ops. So we have a forward proxies and reverse proxies.

So you can see the proxy sends out the group request on behalf of the client there. And what the client indicates is that it's based interested in handling these multiple responses and that it's also capable of handling these multiple phonces, and we combine that also with, time indication now. So there's space the, multicast time out option that magically includes that time that the client is willing to wait for responses. So, the client can also Yeah.

Between the client and servers. And also, there can be security between the clients and proxy on top of that, So this can use DTS or TLS or oscores. So the options are, are open. So this helps also proxy to, authenticate the clients, for example, before, doing the operation. So there's basically 2 layers of security here. K. I'll go to the next one. So the purpose of the presentation here is just to do a quick walk through the changes that have been made in the late revision, So I will, start with that So there's always a couple of simple changes, of course. So we have the editorial fixes, readability improvements, and I can say we find some typos even, so that's all, Yeah. Fix. And There are some clarifications made.

Or, do it through the proxy again. In this case, a proxy will be acting, not as, basically, you know, a group proxy, but group communication proxy, but as A regular. One to one, communication proxy. Also, we clarify that UDP over IP multicast is the default assumption for the transport. Of course, there can be alternatives, but we consider those to be Out of scope for the moment for these documents, And 3rd bullet here is the change that also, consider the new co op options proxy URI and proxy scheme number, So, defined in HRF draft. So this can be used as an alternative encoding for basically the information, sent to the proxy by the client So this proxy should support, both 4 months basically, you know, all the one and then the new one. So I'll continue with, updates there's also two points that were, discussed in previous interim meetings, About reverse proxy. So Thanks for question, for raising these points here. Good. So, Yeah.

That means the client does not include any special options, what this was discussed and, Yeah. We all think in the end, also discussion that is better to have, basically, the proxy require this option in there. So, that also provides an indication the client is is willing to get multiple responses and is also able to to get responses. So that, provide some extra safety in the protocol. And the point number 2 is that, we did some edits to, yeah, not use the RFC AT75 style of, encoding of, Yeah. Basically, you arrive at the proxy within your right path options, but we use more to co op, way to do it, which is cleaner. Okay. I'll move to the next slide now.

So, basically, we have a set of rules that provide you information that indicates that when should you pro protect an option even if it's less URI, to maximize the amount options that are actually And this becomes possible because now you have these nesting and shading of Delscore.

We also have a state diagram in appendix p which you can see in the next slide. And, when we were working on revising these rules, one, side effect we noticed is that when no proxies are enrolled, we end up actually protecting the, you are a host and you are a porch. Options. So they will also be protected. You have, see a sovereign client setup. And, the good thing is, of course, this, this, solution will be backward compatible with points that will not actually implement this, update. So let me go to the next slide. And this is the flowchart of this encryption escalation, I won't go into it point by point, but overall, It's a set of rules that help you determine that. Yes. I have this outgoing message, m, including an option, I'm gonna protect this with those core And another question becomes, okay, do you actually protect this option or not? And then by following these rules, you will end up with, the termination that Yes. Even though this option was reading in class URI, it should be protected. No, it should not be, protected. And, of course, again, the policies can creep as much as possible, but some options you, you cannot encrypt because, of course, they will actually be needed to be read finding intermediate area.

So, One of these points is, that was pointed out by, Christian, actually, is that before you decrypt a message using our core, you should check if you're authorized to perform this operation practically, this means checking if a security context is available, and in an allow list of, that, Alan sender is in an allowance that informs you that you are fine to actually decrypt this request. And this has some use cases, or this is applicable resolve the anonymity of a server, if you have reverse proxy in front there is an actual scenario what this can be important to do Your own point adopted toward authorization is actually a case of something more general. So we switched the naming to say instead of authorized operation with the acceptable operation and acceptability depends on local configuration and authorization, for reverse proxies, yeah, we consider that a reverse proxy can actually act upon the URI Port and your host options. So they are also, in a sense, is now to be proxy related options, which is relevant for our And the rules will be defined. Yeah, to continue on this, Another case that was noted by Christian is that if a request, comes to a fuller proxy, and the target is the proxy itself.

Another point to avoid infinite looping in our rules because in the in the rules that we have, as you can have nested layers of all score, you may actually end up going back to the stort. So you do multiple, nested decryption or encryption. So avoid, possibility of infinitely now say that an endpoint should define a maximum number of Oscar layers. That is a that it is able to apply, remove And, this can have certain bounds. Like, you cannot have more layers than you have active old score security contexts, And, if this limit is reached, the the decryption will fail on the reception, side, yep, we also updated the state diagram in appendix c. And, yeah, it was a bit typo, but minus to squeeze in some of these additions that were pointed out to us So next steps Well, we want to look a bit closer at processing the hope limit option. Because that is to be used in a particular way, and we want, of course, to make sure that some options that exist that the rules we defined do not interfere or breakthrough functionality while still maintaining the maximum level of encrypting whenever it's possible. We also want to look at when should you, and define that more clearly that in certain cases, you should actually add an alter option. After you have produced the corresponding the encrypted option. This is relevant for observe, for instance, we want to handle multiple responses, for same request. Brother. And this is based on the same rationale as the corroscorgroupcom document. Yeah.

So I can just continuing stand. Yeah. So point number 1 was that we wanted to those pointed out that in some situations, it may actually be fine to allow usage of non random nonsense, previously, we always refer to the non system's random values in the text. In some scenarios, you can actually make sense to use counters and we define this concept of a capable device meaning that you can actually persist context information after boot, meaning it can right to persistent memory. So that's a more capable device. Such capable devices can actually use non systems counters. Because it can store and remember the answers for, after it has rebooted, So now we explicitly allow the usage of nouns as encounters And we do recommend that the counters have the same size as analysis, which is recommending 8 bytes, 5 and to put the solution shortly, the non capable devices that cannot stored persistent memory. They must use random values."

And, a 3 there's some privacy considerations that the it is preferable to use random nonsense for privacy. Because if used counters, it can leak information about the frequency of rekeying done. So of course, this is consideration that has to be taken into account if it's a tradeoff between use encounters and, and using the random nonsense. Another thing that be change was that previously, we really considered a clueless execution to be strictly, a request response pair, However, was pointed out that it may be fine to have more flexible, message flows. So for instance, Christian had a scenario based on the, simple registration to the resource directory where you may actually want to have a request be CUDA's message 1, and then another request be CUDA's message 2. And there's really nothing stopping this from working. We also elaborated on this now, and provided some examples. So, basically, can see here an example to the right that declined sending at, well, the client server on the left is sending a request to the pair on the right, And than the pair on the right is whatever reason, it may that point, wish to send a request to the pier on the left. And there's nothing that, is preventing being done in this kind of path and with 2 requests. This, again, was very relevant for the resource directory, simple registration proceed."

Instance, maybe there's a notification that is just going out from the, Server, And that can sort of ask you this message to So overall, it's about, not having this treat coupling between escudos must be a request and response pair. Can actually be more flexible in that. Continuing on, we also added, how that capability that accudos message can actually be as a normal regular application message. Because in the past, we always said that a useless message must target this special well known kudos resource. There's actually nothing preventing the CUDA's message from being just a normal application request that the client wishes to send at that time So on the client wants to do a request to slash temp on the server, this request can then also serve as CUDA's message 1 And practically, this means that the CUDA's message can target any resource at the server. There is some Suttleties that we need to consider here, which is that the server cannot be showed this request is fresh because it's really sent using a just generated new, security context So if the service, needs freshness, you can actually respond to initial request with a protected for one serving as kudos message too. And that for one can then signal to the client that, okay, the server needs freshness, and it responded with the 41 So The client now has to show you to just resend that initial request that it that it, originally sent actually retrieve the resource representation.

So another point we covered was the, splitting out of this, update, of Oscar and the recipient ID procedure. He has to recap what this was about. It's a method for 2 payers to also update their post score sender, recipient IDs, this was based on some other discussion on the mailing list. Basically, it can be a standalone procedure, and that's how it's defined in the separate draft. We also show there an example of how it can be embedded within the CUDA's execution, if you wish to rank kudos combined with this ID update to actually get both new IDs and run computers at the same time. And, yeah, it has a number of properties. Basically, have a new option defined disrecipient adoption class where the sender can define what new receipt in the deed wishes to use. So both pairs basically choose their own new recipient IDs, course, both peers have to agree and opt in to actually do this uptake procedure. Otherwise, the communication will break. And changing the ID is actually, by the way, triggers, duration of new score security context because the IDs are part of the key generation procedure. You shouldn't do this immediately following a reboot. If you're running it standalone, in such case, you should first stop by running kudos And, there's some rules on not reusing the IDs,"

So whether no matter whether the request was actually sent or not and the those are called phantom requests and used in in some kind of notifications. There needs to be a sequence number to send up for the request those will be referenced in responses. No matter how, Now, matter when a response is generated, there is only one response that may ever reuse the request notes. And responses can be ordered. Responses may need to be subject to the replay window subject to some basic to the expectations be to have the the implications behavior And if there are follow-up requests as there are, for example, with observation dates, dates, Then the responder and the client needs to tolerate that there might be reordering between the received responses and either either decrypts the responsibility of the context or tolerates that there are decryption failures because there was just a notification on on the fly in flight while the client sent the updated request And I think that's a rather concise set of rules.

Both for ad hoc and, and age registration, it is it should be possible to send that request unencrypted. Because that request would really not contain any information other than, hey. The there's some device contacting of the resource directory. Yeah. There's just 50 chance what it is doing. I'll look up oral registration. We're not leaking a lot of information there.

More than 2 decades ago, the IP protocol stack was considered unsuitable for space space, This led to the creation of the BTM Architecture its fundamental component, the bundle protocol. However, a very recent draft revisits that conclusion and claims that it feasible to run an IP protocol stack and to end for the space. And the document suggests the use of co op along with also HTTP. And, we this document, we claim that indeed, coab is a suitable protocol for deep space. Because mostly COB has been designed for constrained node network environments, which share to some extent, quite a similar well, some, similarities with the characteristics in this space. So, this document has an intended status of informational, and we aim to offer guidance of how how Cop can be used for if space. So this is a very quick overview of the content in this draft. First of all, regarding the underlying transport, we proposed using crop over UDP. Because in this case, reliability is still optional. There's the shorter header size of UDB. Also there's better support for group communication and there is not the penalty of, for instance, the initial handshakes which are which occur in reliable transports. Then, there's a number of parameters which may need to be, modified or may have to be will have to be modified also some related times. For instance, m start is by default 1. However, it is possible to increase this setting. And, that's as long as there's some mechanism, some way to ensure that there is, no congestion issues there. However, an open question"

So, yeah, at time, I'll will need to be updated, as well as suitable, tune for each particular scenario. Then max returns meet is by default equal to 4. However, perhaps we might want to consider lower values for this parameter in order to avoid maybe to higher latency for current messages. Then there's, the times shown here max latency change lifetime, non lifetime, which are all in the order of 100 seconds or a few 100 seconds. So this will have to be increased may at least a couple of orders of magnitude in deep space environments. And then there's a open question, which is regarding question control, do we actually need conjunction, controlling deep space environments at all. By the way, I take the opportunity to also announce that, tomorrow. There's site mapping, called deep space at 8 AM local time here. And, both this document and also this open question will be the discussed in further details. So feel free to attend it if you are interested. And, then also co op offers, of course, the observe option, which is, very useful suitable in each space environments as it allows a client to obtain, results represent representation whenever, resource changes in a very efficient way then, regarding blockwise transfers, when needed, We proposed using our senior in 177,"

So this is the the second document it's entitled co op of a bundle protocol. Here, my co author is Anna Calvira's also from UPC. So, there has been some interest from the DTN Working Group, in exploring coop of a BP.

So in this regard, we are offering the option to for sender to trans well, to use blockwise transfers. If the details about, contacts in the path from the source to the destination are known in advance. But that's, as an option. Also, we understand that we need, and actually, we attempt to define a new co op over BP URI scheme. Here, called, co plus BD. And then in appendix k, we provide a number of tables which integrate to provide reference values regarding some, times or related parameters, for case of interplanetary communication, So one example is this table here. Which provides, round trip time between 2 celestial bodies of the solar system. And, also, this would correspond to the minimum time out that would have to be used or some equivalent exchange lifetime for my returns meet equal to 0, And by the way, this is in some idealized scenario where the latency comprises only propagation by the way, this document will also be presented in more details on Friday.
