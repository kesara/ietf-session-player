So the updates to the draft are in section 4 and section 5.2. We will talk about these changes in the next few slides. Next slide, please. In section 4 of the draft, we have removed the text discussing requirements for ABR algorithms as previously discussed in the working group. These requirements for ABR algorithms are out of scope for this draft as the intended audience for this document are network operators. These operators are interested in providing edge computing resources to operationalize the exon application use case such as the one presented in this draft. On the other hand, the choice of ABR algorithm rests with the XR app developed. Next slide, please.

Just some some data points. Thursday night football last year, was for the first time stream exclusively on Amazon Prime, averaged about 10 to 15000000 viewers. 3 hours a night, 15 nights a year.

And continuing we could continue doing doing this with brute force unicast. It's worked reasonably well so far. But maybe there's a better way, a better way that's more efficient that reduces cost dramatically. for doing what is being done now. and also makes possible things that that maybe aren't quite so viable these days. Live streaming is not the same as on demand streaming. The biggest difference is latency.

The other things join rates are vastly different for on demand streaming, You know, it's it's a typical diurnal pattern of, you know, it's it's expected. It's smooth.

So that's the kind of motivation and and and why why we're proposing this architecture. What is the architecture? What are the components It's Trudian, which stands for tree based CDNs. And the goal is to leverage the concepts of overlay networking as well as advances in in the evolution of of of native multicast to deliver a service to end users regardless of where they are. They don't have to be on a multicast enabled network in order to receive this multicast content. It it's comprised of 2 components. The native component, we can call on that on that that is the part of the network that is native natively multicast enabled. and, specifically, it uses SSM ASM has officially been deprecated as an inter domain solution. And and SSM vastly simpler. and addresses the the use case that we're most interested in here. And for the parts of the network that are not for for for"

This is something that multicast is generally suffered from. So if you are multicast enabled, you enjoy the benefits, and if you are not, you just get tunneled over. The most important thing is the end users get the content they are not dependent upon their last mile provider. to offer them multicast to to in order to get this content. that? Did that not try it again? did Alright. There we go. make sure I didn't go too far. Okay. Alright. So diving in a little deeper, the components. like I mentioned, the native part uses SSM, why SSM, it's vastly simpler. And it it it solves one of the fundamental problems of Internet multicast, which is it's too complex. We hate it. You know? It's it's too difficult. With with SSM, you know, you eliminate about 90% of the a day of multicast. In terms of protocols, typically PIMSSM, but It doesn't have to be. It could be anything that delivers the SSM service model So you could do MLDP, GTM, even BGP And VPN beer, treesid. You name it. Any anything that can deliver multicast natively in an manner. you can use it. Like I said, SSM is the most common deployment, but And and then there's the overlay component. And the purpose of the overlay is to dynamically build tunnels to the end host or And it it it could be the host. It could be the application layer. or it could be a home gateway router, for example, that is multicastinate"

But the the most important thing is ANT allows you to hop over the unicast only parts of the network. Typically, it's in the last mile, and and it solves the the fundamental last mile problem. can also avoid things like you know, Wi Fi and other in home things that are not multicast friendly. This solves the other fundamental problems of multicast over the Internet, the all or nothing problem, which is, you know, every layer 3 hop from source to receiver, must be multicast enabled. Otherwise, it won't work. That's a really, really, really high bar. And getting everybody on the Internet to run yeah, every every every router and firewall interface on the to run a routing protocol is is really difficult. Just ask the v Six people. So AMT solves that, which just tunnels over. And it also the chicken and egg problem of there's no content because there's no audience and there's no audience because there's no content. ANT is kind of the typical deployment, but it could use anything. You know? Lisp is an example of another tunneling technology. Any tunneling technology that could solve this problem could be used. AMT is kinda built for this use case, though, and it's kind of the the most common deployment scenario. So here's kinda how it's gonna look. You know, you can You can see you have a con does this thing work? So you have your content provider. This is your source. Oh, wow. They're connected to the native component, the 3 d n provider network. And if you have local receivers, native receivers. They receive multicast the way god intended natively.

So you may say to yourself, gee, isn't this what a CDN does? And and, really, it is. I mean, what is a CDN, but it is It's you know, an efficient way of delivering content And CDNs are basically doing multicast without doing multicast. I mean, they're essentially if you look at most CDNs, and there's different CDN models. But if you you know, take the take the typical model where you deploy books, Wrong button. Okay. You you deploy these CDN boxes call them caches, call them whatever. Right? And then you send the content to each of them. and then they handle local replication. Right? and that's that's great. It's it's you know? It's just like multicast except, you know, it works. You don't need everybody to run PIM on every router and firewall on the Internet. But if you add multicast instead to this CDN. You gotta and and This is what Treaty is essentially doing. let's rename those CDN boxes to AMT relays. and we will build an efficient native multi cast tree to those relays. And then the relays will handle local replication. And you may say to yourself, What's the difference? Isn't this the same? So there's there's there's a couple nice benefits to this architecture over traditional unicast based CDNs. The first point is we can move this replication point a bit closer. to the end user. because it can sit on a let's say, a peering router."

But the big benefit And this is, you know, where you get your, you know, huge savings. is these relays aren't, you know, typically a a CDN box is a rack of, you know, X Eighty Six servers and you have the rack them and power them and cool them and plug them into routers. These relays are essentially as a function that is built into the forwarding playing, of of routers. So if you have a routing form that supports AMT. Essentially, you can build a CDN on a chip. essentially zero cost, you know, a couple lines of config in your router. You suddenly can offer CDN services. So if you have that that hardware. you know, you can offer these services at 0 CapEx. and you can argue even perhaps 0 OpEx. because, you know, you're not powering a bunch of new things and cooling a bunch of new things. So this is how you can deliver that same service at what's been called, you know, an order of magnitude cheaper than existing CDNs today. Alright. So the benefits, much more efficient network utilization. You can like I said, it's it's been set. They're they're there's a a network out there called the UmedSAT, and they've said, they essentially use this model. They're using their treaty and provider, the research and education networks, GeomT, specifically.

Can the Internet do that today? We don't know if if if it can. It'd be really expensive. The other thing is, you know, this is a much more sustainable greener solution in that again, you're not you're eliminating the need for a bunch you know, racks and racks of devices. because it's built into the the forwarding plane of the network. in network infrastructure. It's enabled service providers to offer new services. replication as a service. And, again, if they have existing routing platforms that support this They could do this at at@potentiallyzerocost. The other thing about this is, you know, difference is this is based on open standards based architecture using a widely deployed and widely available protocols. Whereas CDN architectures tend to be proprietary and not quite So, you know, interoperable. Also, requires far less coordination between the content provider and the CDN. There's no storage. It's just forwarding packets. So if you don't have data storage, you don't have to work protect that data. You don't have to worry about things like key management, all of that stuff, is handled by the content provider and the end user that's a rep And the The CDN is just pushing packets."

And then the other the the biggest substantive change was we added a section or we added to a section basically, the the the transport layer differences. between Trudian and traditional unicast based CDN. So folks have rightly pointed out, well, you know, CDNs work in way, and there's things like reliability and billing and authorization and ABR and know, a lot of these issues are less multicast versus unicast and really UDP versus TC So, you know, a lot of TCP is is utilized today, and there are, you know, obvious benefits TCP. But, you know, using UDP, it's you know, in in this with multicast, it's going to be much more scalable. and there are tools to address each of these things. So where the purpose of this section is not to solve these problems.

Again, with with you know, TCP based unicast, you can ensure that and authorize each individual user. With multicast, the packets go everywhere, and you don't necessarily know who's getting them. So, you know, this is This is A consequent. This is no different than any other broadcast medium, amino. a wireless area network is is a wireless network has same issues. you send packets out, anybody could be getting those packets. So If you're concerned about who gets them, just encrypt them. And if unauthorized people are getting it, it's meaningless data because it's encrypted.

So I'm not sure you have to look at that one, but to look at the this one, if you're using, like, a 3 d and those type of things, So I assume we are going to use subscriber based on replay case shown toward the inside still I you know, I try to think how how your scheme can scale to such a, you know, like, number. I can give you for 1, a concept and happened the last year in China, to 100,000,000 subscribers. 100 a minute. Well, that goes through the multicast. So yeah.

    "text": "On to the SVTA update from Glendy. Hi. And, Glendy -- Yeah. Can you hear me? Okay. Sorry. From where I'm standing right now, oh, there it goes. I couldn't figure. That's what I was I'm like, I was psyche Anyways, I'm Lundin from Comcast, NBCUniversal. And here I am giving the industry which I typically give at Mops. from the this group. For those who are familiar with SVTA, a member organization. of about a 100 companies right now. And the best way to think about it, if you're familiar with Natog, it's kinda like Natog. for video. So we take a lot of the technologies done in the IETF. You get a lot of operators content providers, seeding people, over SVTA. We take those things. We deploy them operationally. But we also do things where we develop requirements. read feedback into groups like the IETF. And if you're active in CDNI here, You already see a tremendous amount of stuff that comes back in from this VTA. wouldn't it be nice if CB and I did this? and requirements come in. CD and I does it, and then go back up to the SVT. So it's a nice going back and forth there. t And if you are In this room, you're interested in video, there's a very good chance that your company is one of those 100 companies that our members today, And if you're not a member, Will Law, come see me, and we will hook you up. with whatever we need to do to make Rola a member of this from CA. I'm on the board, and I can make it happen. No sales pitches. We also cover a lot of ground because, you know, look, video is complex. and there's a lot of technology that goes into delivering video at scale. So we do QA. Do we do networking and transport? Where we talk about things like DMS. We talk about multicast. You know, we do open cache, we do metadata,"

    "text": "We do security. We do privacy. We do a lot of that stuff. That's the important glue that takes the technology base that comes out of place like the IETF. and turns into a production environment that you can deliver video to the World app. Okay. So these are things of interest. I was trying to make connections between the two groups. So I mentioned CD and I big connection point. We also are doing work on multicast. multi CDN delivery. There's been some presentations down there. Quick is, of course, something that's interesting, and it's a there's a quick POC going on right now. SVTA. when we come to Prague, and I'll this is the pitch to come see moths in Prague. expect to come with a deck full of measurements and stuff of what we actually experienced in our PLC, in the SVTA around quick. And the quick POC, there isn't to do a speed test to say HTTP 2 versus 3 or whatever, we're really building a reference environment for how to do those environment tests in your own production space. and then learn where you need to do better or different or make some choices. And one of the problems we had identified was that people didn't know how to assemble quick test environment. to test their environment see how quick would work and how to tune it. So that's what we've done. We've done the reference implementation. of the tests. And then we're gonna get some initial results. We got I got some preliminary results, but they're not very robustly done. We're just starting to really expand the test suite right now. and get more test data points collected. So come to Prague, and we will give you that data. There's distributed tracing work being done, and there's a paper the group I drove over at SVTIA that started to work on the question of DNS and streaming. other words, all the weird bad things you can possibly do in DNS documented in one place. Okay. In the fall of this year, the ice is gonna go to a lovely city called Prague. We've been there before."

I can probably get some guest invites But we're gonna be there Wednesday Thursday in product. ahead of the ICF. We're also going to try to arrange some joint activities here at the IETF. So things like tagathon stuff that overlaps between the two groups, to try a little bunch of hackathon projects. And on Sunday, afternoon, We're trying to put together a essentially, a video people interest group. It's not gonna be an IETF meeting. It's got MBS PTA meetings. It's gonna be Are you interested in video? and technology and stuff come together and talk about that, how we can work together, the priorities are, what the interests are, And right now, I'm sort of thinking it's gonna probably be from a one to 4 PM, public at the IETF Hotel. on Sunday. So you make your travel plans, don't show up On Sunday, come on Saturday, even better. a few days early, come to the SVT ADD. Take Friday off. Do some touristy stuff around Prague. It's an awesome place. And then Saturday, go to the hackathon, get involved. The only thing we're gonna do is we're gonna ask the groups that are have overlapped at the IETF if they can move and request their time to be on the Monday, Tuesday agenda, way, if you're an SVCA guy, you'll have to stay till Friday. Okay. If you wanna know more, there's people you can talk to. You can talk to me. can talk to Sanjay. Sanjay Put your hand up. You can talk to Chris Loppins. You can talk to Ali Beggint. you can talk to Will Walk because he actually has been at one of our meetings. And you can talk to Leslie. So and or you can talk to your member rep.

I can say that the The board has a revised IPR set of rules that have been proposed. they are reviewing them with counsel from the various companies that need to review these sorts of things. and we're hopeful that something soon will happen. Awesome. I'm I'm feeling very let me put it this way without you know, being detailed, I feel very positive. Okay. That's good to hear. Thank Okay. Thank you. Alright. Thank you, Lynn. Alright. So now we are at the AOB part of the meeting. So is there any other business? Anybody had a brainstorm decided they wanted to stand up and be the shepherd for the ER document? Sanjay? Not for the shepherd, Sanjay Mishra. I just wanted to ask a question to Will. Did you have any suggestion on any language for the IPR that for example, Akamai, would like to propose that might be a way to sort of hear what Akamai has to say about the IPR rules, Well, that may have been appropriate conversation. plus Yes. I can I can respond Yeah. I'm an engineer. She never asked me anything legal. and I can't actually comment. But I I do know it was it was a review. So errors. many of us at Akamai would would like to join SVTA. There were issues with the IPR. Our legal team reviewed them, gave feedback back. We then heard from SVTA that they were revamping them. Hence, hence, my question. good to hear that this progress, and we'll certainly be reviewing them once again when the new IPR conditions are Great."
