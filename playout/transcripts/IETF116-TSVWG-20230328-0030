Is is that incorrect or something. And That that's what we get to get resolution on. I think you know, a lot of the applications that we list you give examples of the draft are well below one megabit per second. So I think know we can probably change that to a lower number and not be excluding many applications today. I'm not seeing in the chat. Some comments from Christian, suggesting sixty four kilobits per second from maybe two this a bit per second suggestions.

I'm aware that many people in the world don't have what we regard as normal we live in a satellite connected pliers, I place this meaning a place that's really remote. Then this is not a common rate. And I don't think the It should be making statements that kind of assure that these people's are sub citizen some power of Internet. So I didn't not a bit careful. I'm also wondering whether we really need it. That's high as a hundred megabits for the draft to actually fulfill the goals So maybe one percent of something small might be an interesting topic to look at and That was my push back individually. That kind of these numbers seem rather high where we could do other things I think future, we can evolve the number anyway.

So I I I really if we do anything like that, anything like saying, hey, So application can dispense with condition control because So we use sorta data. The solid should be really really really explored. Okay. Where your point and this this is not to be interpreted as a threshold below which an application does not to can congestion control. This is just a threshold below which application can use a particular diff code point. The expectation is at all the existing Care guidance and Bg around Udp your congestion response or circuit of breakers that all still applies. Excellent years. Okay. Now on Jason looking good.

Making it percentage based just makes it you know, relative to of that links attributes happen to be.

So I shared Christians concern and what other people have said that what might seem an inc amount of traffic one network might completely float another network. Greg and I've talked privately about this. I'm kind of repeating it for the benefit of everybody else. I'm a firm believer the if a flow doesn't want to build a queue, the way it does that is to use alpha s. And we respect the congestion marks to adjust it standing rate. Cannot not build a queue. And giving any develop the false impression the they use the non Q building desktop mark And magically, that means their flow now doesn't build a queue. There is no magic. You only avoid building the queue by adjusting your rate. And I'm already hearing developers Oh, I copied on q building because we said so. That's why we don't need congestion control. So regardless of the intent of the document application developers are treating n qb as a free pass and went congestion control. Because the network will guarantee that ever will queue.

So those discussions around encryption And Joe's proposal was to avoid Stating the encryption algorithm detail in the draft and simply reserve the cold point for encryption rather than assigning it. Or authentication was up the other topic which raised more eyebrows than the rest of the document. Is arguably very close to Tcp a in the method. And we could do the same reserve the call point rather than assign it. But Joel thinks that there's a lot from Tcp a which can be reused. So how should we play out with these encryption authentication Should we start a separate them? Or and should be not.

It is easier in... When you implement this. Just jump to the previous connection rates. So the thing is also it is more much complicated to implement this kind of mechanisms and and you lose what you could see as your own flow preferences but sometimes you lose, but it is more most complicated to imp these recommendations that not implementing it. But the problem then that will face is when we had in internal discussions on the retreat phase, some people said to words. But when you retreat, why don't you just have the question window? We are being too careful when we see that Something I'm has ten to network work we just want to be a much more cautious that that that is needed or not. I think this is something we need to discussed on to agree on what is being too cautious and what is actually still having a slow start that is efficient Even if you're you network week when you notice that changes in the network, you may want to do as good as us just start Is to this case. May the the thing you don't want to do when you have a very long delay link. And the large is loose all Walks of buckets. That you have to paint fully translate speak later.

It could be just simply an increase in delay. So such that you can react more quickly to see if to see if congestion is starting to build much like some of the real time control.

It's probably better not done within quick because it probably is more than quick although little quickest is the obvious place what you could do this first. Then should it be done in a separate booting room? Should we form a working just control. Well, clearly while that was even being debated, the idea to form just working group. Is maturing and the idea of congress will be talked about in the next presentation. The whole idea of congestion control is no becoming something which is a hot topic. Excellent. I love this. But where should this work be taken? Now we talked to her our Ads and I don't particularly it a lot challenge cow channel link the Ad, but maybe on this one, I can try.

This draft only started after I retired And so it's very, very early work. The goal my goal has always been to find ways of characterizing condition control. That gives you a good definitive understanding of what things are healthy and what things should people shouldn't do, which is not based on comparisons with between algorithms or anything like that. Because I'm essentially using the draft like a little wiki. And gonna keep it person to the point. Experts who be able to understand it and a lot of other people This just mean. It's really for the people in this room and in Congress when if when into appears. I can foresee many different route for this document. One of the issue with it is it's really a bunch of little separate papers each of which is a separate discussion about a separate criteria. And individual pieces of it could be picked out into other documents. And imagine that time. Next slide, please. So I'd like some help. Know in particular, I wanna know if I've overlooked silly things that congestion controls can do to each other then didn't think of. The other thing I'm really worried about is it basically been away from the It idea for more than ten years. And it's pretty easy to discover prior art.

However, the application developers and I had some outright. Argument of some people at my former employer. Seem to think that Tcp could fix all silly things that applications could do. And I am very keenly aware of some cases where there are some applications which when you deploy them at scale at a big enough scale can cost congestion. And have done so. Much to the detriment of the other users. We need to actually address this issue and one of the issues about about this document is a couple of the criteria in particular this one. Has to be applied to the entire stack. It's not just a transport issue. It's an application issue. Which just it's a library issue. And that will have some interesting conversation and other meetings. Next slide. The most common case that you see in user applications is applications that do fairly large network transfers. And if something goes wrong gonna start over from the beginning the worst case pathological case that I've ever heard him was a major soft for install, which in the southern hemisphere. Ran out of time before it finished, and then restarted again. The next tonight. Until it finally finished. And who knows how much network capacity see that burn before it was fixed.

Can you please read the draft and comment on the list Hello. This is about encrypted the transport protocol path signals it's about sending explicit signals from the end endpoint to the network and point. from the network to the Proposal is to have this metadata to be encrypted in a way that only authenticate it on top network elements can encrypt and decrypt it, but it's only for processing not for adding more deleting these metadata. This is in line with the design principles that that are being discussed in the Ib for let need for explicit signals with most of the transport protocols moving to think encrypted note that monitoring any of these metadata, which was previously possibly is no longer possible. So the idea is to provide only the required metadata in a way that network could actually use it for network management and performance optimization. Okay. Thank you everyone.
