John\u0027s I haven\u0027t met the people personally but I\u0027m sure there are some guys they have done a great job and recently I think in the past year this slide deck was taken over by the edu team and they have been working on it since forever okay so let\u0027s see what\u0027s there okay so guys familiarize yourself well with the slide because this is the one that you\u0027re going to see at the beginning of every working session every every working group session as it says it\u0027s an IETF note well our slide so you guys better know that well this basically reminds you of that as an IETF participant you are obliged to or you are expected to follow certain policies that are in effect on various topics that uncovers the patterns or the code of conduct processes there are certain ITF BCPs that is the best current practices documents that are written by very smart people that I advise you to go and read they will tell you about the processes of ITF ranging from internet standards and working group processes 25 it tells you about the entire harassment procedures that the ITF follows about the code of conduct copyright patterns and participation and most recently this privacy policy DCP I think and this privacy policy it basically tells you that all the information that you give to IETF how is it handles all the procedures that how IETF handles our private information you should go read it if you are interested in that sort of thing so this is the most popular slide "
