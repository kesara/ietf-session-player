So on the slide, you can also find a pointer to the online agenda, which you may have seen already several times this point of the week and also linked to the heads which is the tool that we are going to use today. For taking minutes. Recall that this is a collaborative process So everyone feel free to join and contribute to the process of taking minutes.

The first presentation is the usual chairs introduction, which is currently in progress. That will be followed by a presentation on the date of the six low use cases draft by young going. And that will be followed by a set of two presentations by Reg and unknown? On the topic of path aware semantic addressing the first one is the base document for pas. But semantic addressing for L and the second one is a companion document which focuses on the reliability considerations of pas. Finally, there will be one other presentation even by myself, home the transmission of Ship compressed packets over fifteen dot four networks. So as you can see, this time the agenda a bit less part then as usual, That's partly Well, the pascal is here remotely. But unfortunately, he wasn't able to attend in person percent.

Then the next document is the six low use cases drafted. Here the document was evaluated by the then the offers recently updated the draft in order to address the comments. And then the last discuss ballot was cleared recently. And there will be a presentation later today Apparently, there's still a very minor common that will be addressed.

So this may message going upwards or by europe signals to those nodes. If you go to one zero zero, actually red redirect to the route. Okay. Which then we'll forward on the secondary top. Next, Now as kind of a optimization that you can do with you may consider that and one zero zero make the two signal to the to all of these child consider using directly of secondary addresses. Because my on the primary there is a failure. But I mean, this is could be optional just to to optimize things. Next? This is just an example of what happens see two nodes wants to to.

Secondary address of the node which is just downstream the the the failure link. Okay? So with this encapsulation, what happens if we shift the packet to the. Yeah.

No. It that's. This is we send outside. But we send up One zero zero says or the the is broken. So so I sent it through the secondary top. Okay?

On the robustness part because the root test this vision we can handle maybe multiple failures in more optical wait. K. Next, Okay. I hope I was sufficiently clear. As usual, any any any contribution any comments is very very welcome. We still need some work to do. We need To refine the wording wording, there are a few parts that Are not satisfied take the about the clarity. Okay. As I also notice in this slide that there is still some one important thing to do is to align the examples because actually, if you go to the draft"

I'm going to present the last date of his draft and entitled transmission of plus package over the fifteen four networks. My Anna and Flo like from Acc. Next, please. So first of all, a couple of slides as a reminder for the motivation the context for this document.

However, it is possible to apply all recent specification, which is called Chic. Which is the main product of the Lp one Working group which contains had compression mechanism. M with chic it is possible to compress the same by type six udp header, down to just something like, for example, one bite. So she uses static context and it's based on a priority knowledge of the header field values. For the package that will be transmitted. So that's why it can be a little bit more aggressive in had a compression that it performs. So then if we also consider application a protocol life app. There is no six little plants style had a compression defined for gu. However, there is specification on how we can compress go headers with chic, that's sort of c eight eight to four. The club headers are very size. So here we are considering two several cases a corresponds to no header options. Then there is the header size four bytes. And b corresponds to table six, fc eight to four whether there's an example with the card had a size of sixteen bytes. By using chic, is possible to compress those headers in both cases down to just something like for example, one byte. So overall summarizing if we consider the joint, Ip six Udp header. Felt any compression, it would have a size of fifty two or six sixty four bytes respectively with six band. We can compress that down to eleven or twenty three bytes However, with chic, it's possible to compress"

Although caveat here is that well, actual improvement will be lower since a Panel the specific device hardware features like the sleep current consumption. Mac additional application layer settings, the payload size, network. And so on. Next, please? So to illustrate this possible lifetime improvement factor. Figure here shows some results on the vertical access, it shows the maximum battery lifetime improvement factor. On the Horizontal axis it's the grab payload load size. And here we are assuming that we're using short mac addresses japan communication regarding the fifteen or four settings. And it is that this is for a battery operated sensor that transmits one message over fifteen four. So we consider two different scenarios, the start top meaning one hop communication and multi hop that we've mesh under. And also, we are considering the two possible cases for the cop header. So as you can see, the improvement factor decreases with the payload of size, although it remains quite significant, at least for some range of payload sizes, and nevertheless, well, we need to keep in mind that in practice, the actual improvement will be somewhat lower.

And also, we have a new call who's Flo Welcome board. Thanks for contributing. Next please? So this is a diff of the table of contents in zero one compared with the previous version of the document. As you can see, there are several new sections or subs sections. And actually, two of them are quite substantive in terms of the functionality that is being enabled now. So the first one is what we call the pointer base approach for multi hop communication. And the second one is enabling what we call a transition protocol stack. Which by the way we'll present on the next slide. Next, please? So now we're going to see the different updates in the one by the same order in which they appear in the document. So the first date is in section three dot one protocol stack where precise leaders, this new component that was mentioning the transition protocol stack. So on the left, we can see the two left most protocol stacks are ones that we had been presenting in or including in the document in the previous versions. The left one is the traditional six based. Stack. One in the middle, is the initial one or the main one that we have been considering in this document, where the goal is to use sheet for head compression instead of six low for header compression.

So it is to to allow reusing the existing six implementation code, but then also benefit from using chic for the end end protocols like Udp. Any comments? Okay. Next, please. So section three dot three describes the multi hop communication approaches that we are considering. Previously in zero zero, we had three approaches now we have one more that we have added in zero one. So as a reminder, the first one is what we call the straightforward route of approach. This is the one where all nodes including routers must store all the rules in using the network. So This is suitable mostly for small stable networks. Because otherwise, yeah, this approach is not very scalable with network size. So then to try to solve a little bit the problem of scalability. We introduced in the previous version that tunnel based route approach. By which only the endpoints are the ones that must store the rules and only for the communications they are involved in endpoints. So This is based on mode Ip sixteen nine fifty six tunnels, and then this is compressed by using"

Intermediate notes like routers do not have to store the compression rules. And however the advantage here is that the point of this approach doesn't require those routing artifacts. From ripple mode the tunnels and eight point three eight. Here, The solution is based on just having some additional field that you will see later after the chic dispatch which is a pointer and this will allow intermediate notes to determine to reconstruct which is the ip six destination address whenever they receive a packet, so that they can make routing decisions and send the packet to the next hop. So, later, I will describe a bit better what this is about. And the last approach is the mesh under approach where also only the endpoints are the ones that must store the rules for communication only only the communications they are involved in. Next, please? So we have also some updates in the tunnel ripple based route approach so please need first, we need to introduce a little bit of context. Yes, Laurent. You were in the form. Few seconds. Maybe Maybe you will speak later. Okay. I guess, you will speak later. So Yeah. On the tunnel repo based approach, So the overview is. We assume ripple no mode is used here.

Then C nine six eight describes what is needed to allow downward or upward traffic within a ripple network. And for downward, we need a tunnel except when the root itself is the packet source and the tunnel terminate at the last routing a device. So it could be the signal, if it is a routing away leave, or it would be the last six alarm the signal is actually routed and unaware. For traffic, then there would be Ip six ip fifty six also initiated. By the first six alarm, if the sixth line is routing and anywhere, And in theory, the tunnel is a May from the sixth if the six line is routing. Next, please? However, recall that in this document, we update nineteen zero eight because here, need to transform the mail into a must. So that's six nine transmitting a sheet Ip packet upwards. Then the the packet must be tunnel and that's regardless of the final destination. But then here we have the problem, which is what we try to address in zero one. Which is okay. When the Signal is and, What happens with the first or the last hop for downward transmission because we also won that transmission to be efficient. Also want to have some way to compress the ip six or the additional headers. So The solution that we have considered four zero one is that's communication. The first six alarm"

In this case, it's the last six alarm that should be provided with the sheet rules the package that will be sent to the last note, which is the six, which would be routing nowhere. So perhaps this is maybe not the most nice or the best possible ideal solution in the world. Because then it reduces a little bit the dynamics for the flexibility that we can have in the network. Here, this is a Wireless network, which might be quite dynamic. So to really apply something like this. We need to know in advance somehow which will be the neighbors that the first dslr hour will have or the elastic will have. So Maybe there's a little bit less of flexibility, but on the other hand, this would allow to be also efficient in the transmission that last or first hop. So Okay. There are no comments Then next, please? So yeah, on the other approach that we are considering for rollover, We just called point base Route approach? Here, it is to provide some alternative to the tunnel ripple based approach that I was just presenting. Here is that in the fifteen of four frame payload after the chic dispatch, we would place a chic pointer. And the pointer we'll indicate the location on the length of the destination address residue in the chic header. The ship compressed bucket. Okay? So here it is. Okay. The intermediate notes we don't want them to to store the rules. We want to give them simple from that point of view. So then whenever they receive, an incoming packet,"

After the compression. So the pointer will tell what is precisely that? Destination address residue, which is its location and size within the compressed chic packets. So here the assumption is that the destination is within the same fifteen or four network and for sending data to some external mode we would need to think about some additional solution. However, this is lightweight, you will see later the frame format for this. It's actually more with than the tunnel ripple based approach. It is also compatible with ripple repository story motor with other routing protocols and again, nodes are relieved. They don't need to store the rules for all communicating endpoints. Actually, they don't need to store any rules if they not involved themselves as endpoint. So Any comments so far? Okay, Later, I will present the format for this approach. So next please? So as you can see now we have, like, different communication modes enabled by using different possible techniques. Let's see whether as we progress, we identify that maybe we could get rid of some of them or combine them or what we do. But we've added the summary to clarify a little bit the different approaches that we have. So This is also added in the document.

And then we have the last one, the pointer based approach on the right column where it supports ripple repo story or other routing protocols. And here we just need the ship dispatch and also the pointer. Next, please? So section four describes the free formats. That are used by these different approaches. So I'm going to present is just the new formats that have been added in zero one. So first, we have one format added in for the two, which focuses on the tunnel based rolled over. This is for one case that we had been missing before in zero zero, which is when We have downward transmission and the source is actually the ripple root itself. In this case, there is no tunnel. It's kind of an exception. So the format is the one you can see on the slide. What you can see is actually the fifteen four frame payload, which starts with the page switch indicating where in page one to allow compression. By means of eight thirty eight. Then the corresponding source routing header and the ripple information some fields compressed with six low, and then there would be the chic dispatch after that the chic compressed packet. Please.

The first field would be the chic dispatch. And the novelty here is the checkpoint pointer, which comes after the shit dispatch. Again, the pointer will tell where in the compressed cheek header, there will be the destination address residue, and which is the size of that. So that any note can find and reconstruct the full Ip sales destination address even without knowing the rules. Then after the shi pointer, that be the contrast packets. And then if needed padding. So about the sheet pointer. Currently it has the format that you can see at the bottom of the slide. The first bit of that is a p, which indicates whether the next feels would be present or not. And the the second field is the bit pointer, which indicates, which is the starting position of the Ip destination address residue the chic Header. After that, Currently, there's a zero. However, perhaps this could be useful. Future functionality. And the last field is this address length actually it corresponds to the length of the Ip destination address residue. So this is the format that we are considering so far. And perhaps we might discuss to do in future versions of because for example, another approach could be to define a second check dispatch just to tell that comes next is a pointer, so perhaps in that case we might save at least the pivot let's see. Okay. That's one option right. Any comments? Okay. So next please."

So basically, we are not defining new formats here. This is just the same as those defining Rf forty nine forty four. However, using the chic dispatch instead of where there would be, the original dispatch with the possible Ip six had a compression at the time of forty nine forty four. So here, we can see the formats when no fragmentation is needed. Where the beginning does the mesh header followed by the chic dispatch in this case, or when we need fragmentation where we have the mesh heather and followed by the fragmentation header then followed by the chic dispatch. Thanks, please? And this is the format when no fragmentation is needed that we use the broadcast heather, then The order is we first have the mesh header then the broadcast header then the shake dispatch. So actually, we just follow what is in Rc c forty nine and forty four. However, again, for completeness, and clarity explicitly describing these formats. And then when we have several headers that need to be present, we follow the same order, they need to appear in the c order as in Rf c forty nine forty four. First the mesh header than the Broke broadcast header then finally, the fragmentation header. Next please?

The next header would be actually the chic Internet protocol number. This would be un by the way, for the moment, it seems like the tentative number four for here would be one hundred forty five. Let's see whether that is confirmed after the whole process. And then the payload of the Ip six packet is the chic compressed bucket, which in this case, is Sheet compressed Udp. Which carries a quad data unit. So in this case, What follows is the compressed udp club headers and then the club payload. And then finally, padding if needed, Any comment on this?

Even if we consider multi hop communication, then the fifteen four Crc will be checked at the top So first conclusion is that it's possible to actually align the Udp checks if we are using a sheet here. And then the other point is, okay, is there any scenario where we would not? Like to allow the Udp checks on. So at the moment, we didn't realize of any such scenario, So what we have in zero one is that the Udp x must be when using chic to compress Udp headers.

Actually chic can be applied not only in Lp p one environments, but also beyond those as you can see precisely in this document. And the new charter for the shi working group includes work Ic six based protocols of a chic.

So for the chic working group, this is like a call to see if anyone who's interested to actually develop such a work such specifications. Next please? So the last slide just rather a comment on the security considerations that we have the document, one aspect of them. There is one kind of problem. I don't c eight eight to four states that if there is a l two different from Lp wan technologies.

But perhaps we might still like to to benefit from the chic improvements also for the cases where security is really not needed. So in parallel, there is some effort, which is some document presented yesterday in the Lp one or Chic working group, which is an Rf c eight eight two four updates effort. And at this point was already presented. The idea of... Okay. Is it possible maybe to use the effort to update they to four to also lower the must down to a. So we had some reaction from Eric vin that's Perhaps the Ad, the security eighty would not be happy with that. However, perhaps maybe these considerations were not made at the time, So let's see whether we can actually discuss this point. And let's see. Whether it's possible to actually have the masks or the required in eight eight to four.

To save sixteen bits. I was very supportive at that. Because any modern protocol really needs to have crypto traffic security. And if you have photographic security then you know with high confidence. The data was is being corrupted. Intentional accidentally. But then when you talk about making security optional as well, I kinda feel like those two things conflict with each other. And I feel like we can't have both. We can skip the check. So we know we have security. But if we don't have to check some more security, then we become very vulnerable to accidental external corruption. Yeah. Perhaps there is also the point that in those networks, well, perhaps we will need to see how many fifteen or four networks of their are not using security or the no security mode. Because they would still even the the option of having no security at the fifteen at four level. But still, we have the integrity protection not crypto but integrity protection, which would suffice for aligning the Udp checks on. So I don't know if maybe that could still make sense in some scenarios. Perhaps The the point would be whether that many or not fifteen of four networks out there, which do not use security at layer two.
