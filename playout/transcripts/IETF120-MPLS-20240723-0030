So, so what we thought is like to optimize this specific unknown option handling action handling so classified within the same MN substack. So what we thought is like to optimize this specific unknown option handling. So we added the U-bit as part of each op code so that and all like the the multiple unknown handling could be carried in the same MN header so that's a the reason we added the U-bit and the format C, as well as, you know, like, the NAL actually like we changed it to three-bits to align with the format B let's see so previously we had the op code B where actually in some cases you know like upcode B may not be filtered so previously using the flag-based upcode with the zeros to fill in those so now actually like we added a specific we reserved a specific op code too which could be used for no operations so that you know like that that specific uh code be may not be uh mpc Yeah, thanks for the investment"

The whole paradigm of functionality of on-path telemet collecting operational state and performance data is the same. It's based on IAM header How it's collected, that's something that we can discuss So I would not say that, oh, that requires post-tech data because we want to transfer this data in the same packet because if we look at from the point of ROD issue, for example putting in post-tech data will require more information to be put in their descriptor that not merely indicates that"

So, or that information to be flooded in the control plane. I don't see that it being discussed in this document now So in my opinion, that it's not really the post-tech data is in requirements. The post-tech data is an option and so far I don't think that there was been demonstrated that there is a use case that working group agreed, documented in use case M&A use case documents that cannot be solved using ISD So I think that that's something that there was an agreement that we use ISD whenever it's possible And then PSD, if it could be solved with ISD. Of course in the meantime, there are proponents of PSD can work on improving their performance solution.

Is that why you're thinking of? the T-flag? That's what most possible. The P-P-P-Flag is just an optimization, right? So instead of wasting an op code so we are thinking we could use P-P p-bid and then then . Okay, maybe I must understand. You are proposing the P p-flag or removing the p-flag it is it is uh removing the B flag That's what actually like, just thinking about it that's what actually he said, can use of currently we have a p flag another option is can use upcode instead.

This is how you're from, Shuiiorei. I just want to remind everybody that the postcard mode and the passport modes are two very distinct modes Both are very useful and in but in on other hands the passport mode which is carrying the telemptory data in the package is very useful It's a lot of fast-pass processing and the receiver side can quickly in one RTT time and quickly react to the collected data to the source.

You go to the pre- that is 326, I don't think this can be called IOMDX, because the reason is very simple. You go to the previous slides, the format is totally different from what's specified in that RFC Because of the bottom step beats and the leading one bit, you change the ways of so many different data fields. So it's totally different I simply don't think it can be called a lot Dex anymore Yes, it's IAM DEX of RMPOS We have constraints of MPOS net networks and then we implement the function that is allowed by MPOS network encapsulation So do you see the functionally it's different? It allows collection, all the information elements that's being defined so far and even allows the same extension. So if more information elements defined for ire registry will be supported by this approach first i think the term iom d x has a its best five. Second, if you put it into the IOM framework, you should follow the basic specification of IOM For example, the IOM namespace, now you change it to, because of the leading base, you shorten it. So it's a different. It's a, it's example, the IOM namespace, now you change it to, because of the leading base, you shorten it. So it's a different, it doesn't comply with the framework anymore I think that's a bigger problem.

Okay, optional to me means it might be omitted altogether So if we omit altogether, that would be iom decks still, right? No, you fly altogether. So if we omit altogether, that would be IOM DEX still, right? No, if I need a 32PUS flow ID you can only put 30-3 piece there. No, no, but it's different Okay, let's go back. If you insist on analyzing based on base IOM Dex, RFC, 9320 if i remember correctly uh so not including optional fields, would that be IEM Dex in your definition? Of course So what's a problem? We don't include it for some implementations and we define optional fields differently for MPOS network I'm gonna to exercise my prerogative here.

Rakesh rakesh rakesh gandhi from Cisco Systems. Greg, you could go back to the slide where you were showing a sequence number and flow ID. Please this is extensive, right? You could have, I believe they have in IPPM defined 10 or more of such I could have, I believe they have in IPPM defined 10 or more of such IOM fields or that are being, because that's what the extensions and flags mean, right?

Okay, IEMDAX is not, in RFC 9328 does not define anything for extension flags They're just, you know, as good as reserved fields. Because what I understand that you can have time stamp, but there are a lot of other extensions you can have with this But again, it's something that it's not yet been defined, so I don't understand what the question is. Maybe we can discuss offline I can show you all the drafts where you find the access and No, drafts, again, we are not implementing drafts here we're implementing RFC but i'm saying that this is extensible so you can have a lot more data for you than this. Okay, when it's been when IPPM working group will define it, then we'll look at how to support it in MNA, of course And the second question is that, uh, there is an RLD problem will it, will this affect as well? Or this, because it's an RLB? it will not affect it. That's a good question So I believe that RLD is very important obstacle to M&A. And that's why on purpose, this proposal is only for direct export so that it would not aggravate ROD issue because I believe that transport their operational state in a trigger packet makes it more challenging because of RLD So if it's just for exporting, there are three other proposals as well That is just done to do the per hop telemetry.

And as I mentioned, if it's coupled with a hybrid two step proposal, then it given even further reduce the impact by removing two optional fields because they will be correlation will be done by using hybrid two step, for example. Yeah, so there are proposals like that as well so maybe we should look at it which is much shorter than this. Yeah, thanks. Thank you you Thank you. Thank you. Yeah So, um, I agree that by adding the flow ID you can eliminate the mutation path, but actually like if the midnotes are not still so legacy routers right then actually like you're going to have the same problem on the midnotes but actually it might there are different values in the LSC for the same flow well I don't think that actually, again, if there are two approaches to address the immutability issue with that IEM decks. So first, either limit the space that used for sequence number or don't use optional fields and use the mechanism of collecting data that provides you correlation"

There is another RFC for the IOM direct export It defines another option type. There are the solution. It has two pieces One is the in-stack network action with the P post-tech network action offset.

Next slide So as we discussed, it is to transport the IOM of option types in MPLS networks as well as the direct export. This use case is I are described in the MNA use cases drop All option types are listed in the use cases and we say we will work on them. The scope, there are a couple of RFCs from IPPN working Group. So we'll use the MN solution for Instac, post-tech as well and of course when we talk about post tech there is always the first new enable that we had to worry about. Next slide, please So the solution is in a way quite simple. There are, thanks to the extensibility of the MNA solution in stack, the upcode, the network action is defined that says that I need to perform IOM network action and there is a pointer to where the data fields are, that's in the post-tech. And we'll look at there advantages why the data fields are in post-tech and not right in the label stack. Similarly, if you doing direct export, there is another op-code defined for it. It's a different RFC. So the is a different op-code for it, different data fields are a bit different there as well. The rest applies that comes from the Amina solution.

There are obvious advantages of carrying data fields in post-tech. One is that you don't have to worry about ECMP hashing It only uses INSTAC, so data fields are out of the way. All of the encodings are based on the RFC that IPPN worked on to define all of the encodings and data fields and spend years and years developing. So we're just using leveraging the work there and it's it's, IOM has a lot of extensibility there's a lot of data fields uh that we add so in case the is an RLD issue, for example, the post-tech data is out of your way because you can say you don't support the network action and you can go to the next one in stack right away So there are some advantages like that if you're doing direct export or telemetry or things like that on a part of a half basis, a lot of the stack right away. So there are some advantages like that. If you're doing direct export or telemetry or things like that on a power-hop basis, a lot of data fields are like metadata. It just used to export the packet used by the controller So it can easily be in post-tech data. You don't need to be in stack, take it out of the way So those are the advantages why we think the post-tech is a good option Next slide, please So few IAN requests So we already have MNA solution in working with lab calls, so a couple of upwards defined, and the same kind of TLV for post-tech with upcord definitions as well, and it will say this is IOM, and you have pointed to where the data fills are"

Thanks Comments, questions? Greg, please come to the Hi, Greg mirsky. So if we can go to the example that shows the pre-allocated use of PSD so because that I yeah, here, so that probably is easier to illustrate and explain what I was asking, Jack is that because the pre-allocated space aggravates in my opinion, the ROD issue, because even that header might be within ROD, their allocated space for the data might be beyond it So how a node can deduce whether that's the case or not, because only with indication of the presence of post-tech data, it appears that there is no sufficient information to understand and take the appropriate action because the implementation needs to probably will have a compromise whether contribute data or skip it and keep their wire speed forwarding so that's and that's the case probably, it's more the question, it's not for EuroCAP not for this proposal"

    "text": "but for a more generic, PSD header. So basically, that's what Joel, I believe, I understand his question was asking is how that information can be conveyed so that each node down the stream can determine and make the action and basically and again, that probably would be implementation specific, but there needs to be information that can be read from the header information that which is a part of the ISD Yeah, I can answer that, and that's a good question. I think we had a mailing list discussion as well. Let's see that RLD is 128 byte and you have a label which is 4 byte So let's say you have a as well. Let's say that RLD is 128 byte and you have a label which is 4 byte. So let's say you have 10 labels, which is 40 bytes and the part tracing header that we have defined that has embedded in interface ID as well as the soft short timestamps So that's a 48 byte header. So if you add that, that's only 88 byte of RLD. The Nord can do 128 byte. So we know from based on our experience that we can do part tracing which much lesser RLD than Nord is capable of. So that's one data point. And to answer your second question how does a node know the RLD? So it knows because we define, if you go to the previous slide, Tony, please so we define the network accent. So it says TBA means I need to do I OEM, the part tracing And then it says that offset is let's say, 32 bytes from the bottom of the stack. So based on this information, say, oh, I cannot go 32 bytes because my RLD is so much. Let's say if there is a node that's not capable of certain RLD. So this gives you, because that's why we have the pointer or opposite says oh I cannot go that this"

    "text": "if there is a node that's not capable of certain RLD. So this gives you, because that's why we have the pointer or opposite. So this is, oh, I cannot go that deep. I cannot support this IOM. There is an U unknown action handling defined and you can skip IOM and you will move to the next network action. Yes so see and begin basically you use only an example saying okay, if we collect their ingress interface information and timestamp, but the profile there IEM informational element, that's much more, they're richer than that you can add residence time you can have some more So basically, why then have use all this space name space that has a different option of collecting informational elements that we're saying, oh, don't use them because that you impact your forward performance because you will be out of ROD or skip this node because this node has too shallow ROD, okay? so we have this powerful and very useful tool but we limiting ourselves and using it and applying it because of our things. So that raises the different question of, maybe we need to use it differently Okay, maybe not to use it as a hammer but use it really as a microscope okay thank you so thanks Greg And I think we need to go in staff So let's say we define power-hop delay measurement using the timestamp I recorded on each hop So that's the use case we can easily address. Then we define the next use case where we can trace a packet path in the network using interface ID. That's easy to define So you can easily define the data fields and you can extend it based on the RLD of the node"

Thank you Okay, hello everyone Yeah, thank you, thank you Tony Hello everyone. Good evening H.C.A.N. from ZTE Here's talk about the MNA for the 10 minutes latency. Let's slide Okay, first we would like to acknowledge the comments from Adrian Ferrio, lou berger, greg mirsky and Lowe Edison And would you like to, okay I would like to thank for your attentions because this draft has been presented at ATF 115 and 1 meetings Thank you And breaking up for a lot of time is breaking up very badly Your voice has become non-determined non-deterministic non-deterministic I'm sorry, this is working Rakesh, your sense you're here would you like to take over?"

Thank you, Rakesh Thanks, everyone So this draft are deterministic latency bounded latency use case for that net as described in the MNA use case draft and that net also has a document that requires some of this that talks about some of these requirements for that net scaling so we're trying to address the those two require using an MNAX and define. You can go to next slide, please There is a bit of terminology, which just wanted to make sure that when we talk about data deterministic latency, we're talking about it's a latency that we can control. It's deterministic It can vary a bit, but then you vary varies, we know what the bounds are as well It's measurable. So that's what we're talking about. When we talk about deterministic latency And network action is basically the M&A network action for this particular use case Next slide, please so it's a straightforward thanks to the TLV type of MNA solution there is an upcode and the length obviously and some of the data are basically related to the network deterministic latency as a couple of ADs we added there is already some work done for the uh f label or s label uh to map in particular cues and things like that And this is, we call it enhanced"

Next slide So there is a lot of good discussions in the net net about what data should be carried it there is there's a huge list of data and obviously in theory there can be a lot of parameters, but what really makes sense is the queuing method and the timestamp some of the deadline kind of information that this is required a certain of delay bound, and this is the timestamp this is a delay bound, and we need to respect that one one good thing that was alluded before is that that net doesn't have ECMP issue so it allows you to put things like times into the label stack next slide please. So draft has been around it has gone to a couple of very good reviews and many thanks to everyone who provided review comments and authors, we believe the draft is there for working group adoption Any comments or questions? We have one minute Yes, me. Thanks for rakesh gandhi authors So this is, you know, a it's a debt net related use case and I think it is an the proper place because we're defining the data plan encoding for the solution in MPLS Nevertheless, are you planning to present or have you presented this? in the debt networking group to get their feedback? We've done that in the past and I remember that that networking group chairs asked to be kept in the loop So what's your feedback on that? So there was a good discussion with"

    "text": "that net chair about this and this resulted in the simplification that we see that it only has a couple of parameters. The previous version of the draft had lots of parameters and it would be difficult to implement so that's why that's the simplification came from the discussion with the Datnet chair but maybe we'll make an effort to actually present it into the working group and get their feedback as well Do you know? Yeah, Chedon from Hawaii, I noticed that this use case was actually in the appendix of the use case draft doesn't mean that if we want to bring it to a more formal discussion or adoption, maybe we need a case draft doesn't mean that if we want to bring it to a more formal discussion or adoption maybe we need to move that one into separate use case document and being endorsed endorsed by the data networking group instead I mean is this a question for chairs or? maybe I didn't understand the question? Well, actually, in my understanding in the recollection of what debt net working group expressed is that this idea of latency, budget is not being adopted by the debt net working group So I think that I know I agree with TARIC so it seems like a solution to the problem is not yet been recognized by an acknowledged by that networking group. So let's first move in the steps So first get that net networking group agree that the latency budget propagation in the data package is the viable and acceptable"

So, yeah, so if we look in the history, there have been long time outstanding individual contributions in a dead net proposing their idea of propagating the budget through the network and then if you are out of your budget, then probably dropping the packet is as good as policy, but that is not yet been adopted by that networking group And that's exactly what is trying to solve Yeah. Thank you Thank you very much and see you next time bye thank you Thanks, everyone Thank you"
