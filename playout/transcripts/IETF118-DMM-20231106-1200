So the main updates or other comments are related to from a review from lender. And, the question was whether 5 g end to end network slicing is for the control plane or the data plane of both. And we've added clarification cover in the next page. And also whether we see the apple applicability of this kind of transport engineering in the front hall network due to time sensitive nature of the network. Here, I think this is already covered in the drafting. We replied. I'm just, copying that over here to say that the provision slice capabilities in the frontal network must take care of the latency engine budgets of the specifics lies for the frontal network. In in general, It's, the general practices you use layer 2 networks. And, means of slicing based on that. And the details are provided the draft already I think Linda has accepted those comments also. And then the question is is the UPF to service the destination path outside the scope of the 3gpp. So here, I think it is definitely outside the scope of 3gpp. The scope of 3gpp or the PDU session and the control and, data plane aspect.

It was user plane functions, and, and we give the examples of control plane functions, user plane functions, and the radio slice, common functions.

So any candidate or the unique address So we have another mean, if they're using in any cast address, I mean, the DNS resolution is probably gonna for that service is going to give that any cost address Yes. And then we don't need any interworking with That was my Yes. Yes. That's right. Yes. Thank you. And for I'm a shuttle from I have a question that,"

Sophie, IP address, Uh-uh. No. I I think of, in my opening is that I I know that the PTO session can created for next slide. One slice can can can perhaps can have one visualization. And now you mean that you will create a once, one PDU session for one service, right, so in here, we we don't consider any of the slides. So this line, the same slide, and we have the multiple serve it at different location. That's how I was calling. So I know that. Yes. One service, they have, have multiple locations. Yes. Site? I want to say, the service, or I can have a lot of service. Yes. Right? A lot of application. Right? So you will creator I is is pediatric session for each application. Right?

I think one PD session could be a pre cover for, multiple service because the breakouts be up available. In the fibers, Sorry. Can you Home. Question is here on why the, these twelve assume the, part service system. Creation I just want to ask her because is, 5 g interface.

So today, I'd like to introduce our new proposal about SRH reduction for srp6andmttp6ebehavior So here's the background. So Now RFC 9433 defines a server 6 map, a server 6 mobile user frame. Which is the inter enables the interworking between the 3 gpp mobile user brain, and there was also the server 6 transport network. Yeah. So so this this ROC defines a translation between the GTPU and the SRP 6. In the status manner. And here is a 2 additional draft about, related to this several 6 mapped. And the, second run is, SNP's map architecture, which is defined as a control plane. To enable the it's a basic mobile user brain. And the the sub bar is"

And so today, so we would like to forecast about, end MGP 60, if it is, translate, SRT pockets into the GTP you packet, which do you know to be address have, ip36 address? So in to to before the moving to the, this behavior. So, little bit caps, sir, but, sir, in the MDT before behavior, So in this behavior, so we use, we we need to know the IP brief for address of the genome to be. So we store this IP address in the seed. So In that sort of shows the IP before otherwise, but it's gonna be. And, also, we, need, our small session, which is used for the restoring the QFR and the teid So we can utilize, all a 120 edge bit of the IP basics And, we can enough, add a space, bit bit space to store the IP before address and agamo recession, But for all Fant, in the case of the ZenOB, have a IP B6 address, we need, more beats. To restore us IP basics you know, the address. So in this and MGTP 60 behavior. So we need the 2 seed to restore as a full information happy with 6,"

And then, a MVP 1. So we call it, SR gateway, in the previous, RFC and the draft, needed to restored the IPPCs destination address from the city 0, and also, Mister Raza did you've required the information for the DTP, you hit, like, TD ID and the QFI from the So this behavior is very, very hard to implement in the current how they're pipeline on the l routers. So we like to propose a new behavior, to reduce this, how do you unfriendly behavior. So we just put, one seed. To to destroyed that ipv6 address and, GTPU hit us, UTurizing the SR based map controller's controller brain, So in this case, so we we need to just one seat. To restore the GPU header and the PB6 address. So MVP to ingress PE for the downlink, just put ipv6 header, the distance address is, this behavior of the seat, I'm saying, so, MFPB 1, restore the IP V Six address and that if you had that, from this just one seat. He had a little bit complicated, but, this is a behavior of this seat. So here's the do you know the other race? So if we have, 128 beats, So we'd utilize,"

Read it, between the locator and the function, also, the, you know, the rest of prefix. But, always, so IP in the IP basics, so we using 16 4 as as a 64, prefix for the ipv6 network.

So he looks up to this table and gets 100 tons of for 4 4 beats, prefix over the genome's address, then so they, he, combine the reminder be Sierra field and the berphy. And then so he can restore the IP basics complete other race. And there was also a GPU head, is restarted from the other small session in the same manner. Is that radius, format. Bishabia, So here's the deployment options. So there are the 2 put down classic using a classic seed and, using a micro seed. Is the format 22 and the for 16.

So I'd like to ask you to this community to, about, some feed the box and the other price and the suggestions and this, proposal, but I have already received, one feedback from a community.

So because, so, I arrange this, order of the bit field based on the current and the and the DTP fold It's sorry, andm.gdp6e, So just to utilize, remind the 0 parting bits to the in the in the in the in the in the stores, you know, the address.

So the reminder that it is following, and then so I'll ask Mobis to join they're paying, In in this case, so information, which is needed to restore the IP basics dissipation address is in front of the beads.

So I'm welcome to your comment and the feedback and suggestion Thank you. there. Tom Helligan. Hello I have some questions. Yes. Actually, the the last slide was was was quite useful as an illustration, I think, that one there. Yeah. It looks more efficient because in theory, potentially fewer bits to pass and to forward But is the action of separating the destination address? More efficient than simply pointing to And did you test that? I'm so sorry. I I couldn't get the point. So in this situation, using microsids, you are hiding effectively. The said, in the destination address. Yep. Yep. You would normally use. Is it more efficient to read that in? And split it out. Versus doing that operation and pointing towards the Sid. SRH block in the SRH block. I mean, this this these are questions that I don't think have been answered yet, reasonably, there's an assumption if we take away the SOH, there's fewer bytes and it's better. Are not entirely sure that the actions, and indeed, some of the more complicated options that are available within my credit sound incredibly complicated. So, as much as this is a very simple use case, along those lines. I am deeply concerned that bits. It's touted as being more efficient and friendly at a hardware,"

That's important. And I think the third thing, and that this is this relates to a draft that we have in interior. Trusted domain SR V6. That once you take away the SLH in this case, at the moment, there's no real way to it from ipv6. And that concerns me deeply as someone who has to build secure networks. So, I mean, if you haven't seen the draft, if you'd like to take a look at it, we can always talk about it, but I would say that And and if there's a, a more appropriate way than an ether type, within this context to be able to differentiate SRV 6 and ipv6. Love to talk about that. Thank you for comment on the suggestions. So, I understand. So the max is not it's standardized, and now we are, going to find the how come be be SoftBank deployed, this, behavior and, it's always connected to that. Okay. I'd like to, discuss it among the OSAS Hey. It's Suresh Christian. My is not very good, but I think what Tom was trying to ask is the compromise between the space and the processing. I think if you can just give measurements for that, I think that's what he was asking for. Because it makes it shorter, but it does different operations. I think It's a fair ask for that. Right? And I like it, but one question I didn't get the answer from I read the draft, is that the how does advertisement work? The the longer prefix fed what what protocol does it use to send it? you you you're asking the first course. So Where does it go? Is it on RAN signaling something or so So it's a very smart architecture draft defines, ISED will route. Okay."
