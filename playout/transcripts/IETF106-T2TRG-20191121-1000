    "text": "people can put together in a focus working group there is a question about when you talk about onboarding in more general right what resources do I get access to who does this device actually belong to does it belong to Eric does it get access to the video camera at the door the thermostat whatever in the house that might be a bit more research here I don\u0027t actually know right we\u0027ve done some of that with mud right yeah so we\u0027ve already have all ready produced a standard there but but but it\u0027s not the manufacturer that decides who can access my my camera at my front door right that\u0027s me but how does the device belong to me well I can come up with schemes but it\u0027s not obvious that there\u0027s one answer and it could be different for different domains as well different use cases right so maybe figuring out where the boundary is is a useful thing but starting with the network onboarding I don\u0027t know about the sort of general inbound let\u0027s have a place in the IDF to discuss IOT as a working group is that you have you have to have some motivational factor to have people show up and actually try to do something even if that\u0027s writing some documents that describe what they think is the shape of the dot part of the world right there has to be some motivation that that drives focus in there and I think is I I t\u0027s way too broad for that but but also thanks Michael Richardson here um so I mostly agree with Mohit we should we should probably make use more use of t2 TRG I would particularly like to know the Friday schedule pre meeting schedule at least four months in advance so that I can adjust my other Friday pre meeting scheduled people around would have been there I would have tried harder to be there last week and I known more than it three days in advance but so I think we actually need that big long time as Elliott said we\u0027re running at a time right now I actually think is very little value in having the t2 TRG meeting this one here now I think that that it needs the the whole date to discuss the second thing is that I think that t2 TRG has has been focused on particularly like wish she typed things like McCool\u0027s and and caustics presentations earlier and while I find them fascinating I not a participant in that I think we need to branch into other bigger things and I think it\u0027s the way to do it but I wanted to respond specifically to the systems question the IETF does do systems architecture we have routers on the internet they\u0027re stupid and we have we thought they were and we have endpoints and that\u0027s a systems things and the internet doesn\u0027t operate without the fact that there are routers on the that move layer three packets around and the problem we have in all of the onboarding system proposals and the pushback we get as Eric just alluded to how do i onboard what on board two we have not described a system architect that says that a "
