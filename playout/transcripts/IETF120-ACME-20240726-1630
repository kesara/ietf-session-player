We've been encouraged not to try to paraphrase this to the people in the room so especially not to say, oh, this is just about being nice to each other It says a lot more than that so please read the note will and note it well well This is an extension that talks about repeats the stuff about the code of conduct and anti-harassment and what you should do if you are a witness or a victim of harassment some meeting tips for people who are in their make sure that you do sign in via the Datatracker or the QR code or the, Meetecho Light client And keep your audio and video off if you're not using the onset version For remote participants, please use a headset like I'm using and make sure that your audio and video are off unless you are chairing or present And I'm going to be with my video off for most of the time Okay These are the general resources for the IETF 120.

Yes, I tried to request some, sorry q mysel mpth i tried to request some time to discuss Acmey onions.

So I'd like if we get any other business at the end to just sort of continue that discussion verbally That's fine. Okay Right. So and Brandon says in the chat room that he is here and not sure if here is in the room or just in the chat room but it's fine either way okay so with that we can continue to document status so there have not been any new RFCs since September ARI, we have a new version from the end of 35 been any new RFCs since September. ARI, we have a new version from May 31st, and we have a presentation so I'm not going to steal Ernst Thunder Thunder DTN Node ID, we have a presentation about that. So Also, well, it's not really correct to say that there has been no new version since IETF 119 because the newest version is from the Monday after IETF 119 And for a long time, we've been stuck waiting for DTN BPV7, Admin, Ianna to progress.

So I think that those can now progress. One general comment that's editorial about this DT and Nose, ID validation draft is that the term DTN that's used in the title in a couple of sections and and descriptions of things is a little bit more general purpose than what actually is present in the sense that this is not a catch-all validation method, this is using bundle protocol version 7 And so there might be some good wordsmithing to have to clarify and replace the term DTN here with something either BPV7 or something a little more specific that it's not misunderstood what's happening here The descriptive text is all fine the mechanism is fine. There's no technical issue with this. It's just a terminology thing And the reason why it was mentioned only is that the DTN working group itself is looking at expanding its charter and dealing with things that are not just bundle protocol and we just want to try and be less confusing to somebody who would be reading this for the first time but that is something also that could happen"

There have not been any substantive changes since draft 04 was published, and I'm not currently like prepping things for a draft 05 or anything like that Basically, what that makes as far as I'm concerned is this is pretty stable. It is fully implemented as it currently stands by 10 independent client implementation and at least three server implementations and based on various things that have happened in the WebPkI space, at least two other certificate authorities have both pledged to implement RE draft as remediation items for various incidents that they have been tracking in the Mozilla, Bugzilla, CA incident tracker So we have implementation and adoption by quite a wide variety of clients and servers of the current version of the draft. I am not in these numbers counting anyone that's implemented earlier versions of this draft So yeah next slide There are two maybe three open plus questions. Okay, so the top open question here is for the last few weeks there has been one bug open on the issue tracker The discussion on that bug does not have a clear and obvious conclusion, but it's also a very minor thing. This is very simple according to the current draft, if a certain"

Following along from the rest of the Acme documents, the answer would be kind of no. The errors that we have are not super specific. The vast majority of new order requests get rejected with reason malformed That's kind of what you do for that new order requests. But there's a question here of like, should there be a new acne error type? Should this draft specify that you have to return HTTP 409 conflict? because that's kind of the semantics of what's going on here I think this is not necessary, but it's an option And so if people have strong opinions on that, I would be willing to incorporate that. It would be like a one sentence change to the doc Q, I'll get to you in just a moment Thank you Second thing, literally like two hours ago, someone filed another issue in the bug tracker. I have not had a chance to like fully digest what that issue is asking about. I will continue discussion on that bug Three, this has been stable for a while We have adoption in a bunch of clients and a bunch of servers.

This is a new kind of error I don't think HTTP foreign eye addition. None of the errors currently in Acme really makes sense for this. This is a new kind of error. I don't think HTTP 4 and 9 is necessarily the best thing And the Acme clients already understand, like, the error is returned by the HTTP status and then there is a more specific error inside so if we add a new error, clients that don't know this will still go oh, HTTP 400, bad thing happened, but the clients that are smarter can be more informed about what the hell went right And the, you know, Agni already requires that clients handle unknown errors. So I don't think there's a reason not to add an error and it's always nice to have a bit more specificity when possible Yeah, fair. I think there's a slight bit of complication there and that if I recall, correctly, 8555 doesn't actually have like 8 registry of acne errors It just has a table of them. So it's slightly unclear to me how to augment that I think that is an Ianna registry. It is an Ianna registry So thank you. My memory is incorrect. Then it'll be totally trivial to add that And that's the last slide from this part from this side from this from this deck? That is correct. Yeah, okay So what I'm suggesting is that to started working group last call. We'll try not do it together with DTI and Node-D because otherwise people get confused And we can call out the two open questions in the working group class call. We're not just there starts over two weeks of working with class call, but they started two weeks and"

    "text": "there are these two open questions and then hopefully that will get people to participate more Okay, so we can move on to the next deck This is also yours, we can see by the color scheme. Okay, I can prophet and well this has a name of a draft. This is not a real draft. I mean, it's not submitted yet. Correct. Okay So this is just, I want to use this opportunity to pitch an idea that has been bouncing around both my brain and the working group as a whole for a little while now I do intend to put together a draft for this for reasons that will become clear in a couple slides But yeah, this is sort of a like advanced heads up I intend to write this document. I will be seeking feedback Basically the problem that I want to solve here is that the new order request as a like advance heads up. I intend to write this document. I will be seeking feedback. Basically, the problem that I want to solve here is that the new order request as it exists has a couple not that clients can tweak, but they're very limited. You can request a knot before and a not after, but several ACPB servers let's encrypt included, ignore those fields And of course you can request the set of identifiers that you want. That's about it as far as the new order requests goes. So if you want to customize some feature, of your request, for example, whether or not to include the OCS, must staple extension, that all has to be as the new order request goes. So if you want to customize some feature of your request, for example, whether or not to include the OCSP must staple extension, that all has to come in the CSR, but including customization like that in the CIS is really unwieldy and unfortunate for a large number of reasons This comes really late in the process. This happens at finalized time so you can't change anything about how validation occurs based on anything that's going to be changed via the CSR"

    "text": "Cs are like untrustable I don't actually want to be parsing CSRs and I definitely don't want to be copy data directly out of CSRs. There's obvious ways to get around that, but I'd still prefer to touch the CSR as little as possible. They suck because X-509. It's also too fine-grained You couldn't tweak a bunch of different knobs in a CSR. What extensions do I want? What extended key usages do I want? What normal key usages do I want? All sorts of different things, and it's then up to the scene extended key usages do I want, what normal key usages do I want, all sorts of different things, and it's then up to the CA to determine whether they want to issue a certificate contained the particular combination of action All sorts of different things. And it's then up to the CA to determine whether they want to issue a certificate containing the particular combination of attributes that you've requested in the CSR and that's a combinatorial problem that you just shouldn't have to solve. And finally, CSRs are actually a pain for clients to minutes for a lot of the same reasons. People regularly produce CSRs that are broken and violate the X-5 and 9 spec in a large number of ways. And anyone who wants to be, at least a little bit liberal in what they accept has to deal with that So a new order doesn't work for us right now to tweak request and the CSR kind of sort of works but is bad. Next slide So the proposal here is reifying the idea of profiles If you've spent any time with CA operators, you're very familiar with the concept of profiles, basically every CA has something that they call a profile, which determines like what set of attributes and extensions go into the certificates that they issue. Many CA have many, many profiles because they tweak assets of their certificates for different enterprise customers and stuff like that. The idea here, is letting an Acme server"

And this is just saying one Acme server can now advertise multiple profiles that are still hand curated in the same way as their single profile is The pros of this are that it's very simple for clients to implement, and it's very simple for site operators to configure. For a client this is like one extra field in a new order request and it's like one extra config field for a site operator, it's filling in one extra line in a config file or selecting one thing from a drop down and a web interface The con, and this has come up a little bit, in previous mailing list discussion, is that there's no dynamic profile negotiation here This is not detailed lists of every single aspect of the profile so that a client can build a acceptance matrix of all of the different profiles they see and figure out which one match their operators preferences no, no, no, no, this is just, there's some profile names They have some human readable descriptions The site operator selects one for their client to require That's it. Very simple. Next slide Next slide, please There we go. So the concrete proposal here is that the directory meta just grows one"

Right now that's sort of up to the CA operator. Next slide And then you augment the order object So the order object grows a field called profile When you place a new order, the order object that you post to the new order endpoint can have this profile field in it. If you select one or if you don't and the Acme server selects it, default profile for you, that profile can then be reflected back in the order object when you post as get it to see the status of your order And then at issuance time, that profile, or at finalized time, that profile will be used to customize the contents of the certificate Next slide So I said earlier that the reasons why i intend to make this a draft would become clear uh That's here. Let's encrypt already implemented this. We've been working on this here the last several months. We have full support for this. We are not currently advertised any extra profiles in our directory meta object, but we can as soon as we configure them, and the full issuance pipeline works And yeah we have integration tests doing this whole thing Our profiles are currently capable of controlling the validity period, the common name the subject key ID, the TLB client off, and the key encipherment key usage. These are the things that we care about changing from our current issuance to future issuance. But this is 100% implementation details for us, right?"

So for us, the next steps are standardization doing the draft here client implementations I have one client's implementation that works already. It was a like 10 10-line change to a existing Go Acme client It's very simple to implement, but obviously we need to act actually upstream that and we need more client implementations And three, we want to profiles to be able to control things at validation time such as like the lifetime of the authorization objects so that the Acme server create for you and the lifetime of the order object that the Acme server creates for you. And we haven't implemented those assets of it yet. But again, that's entirely implementation details in the back. So yeah this is sort of a heads-up status profiles are a thing, let's encrypts already implements them We think it's a pretty good idea and I hope to have a draft for this in the working group sometime in the next month or so I think that's it Okay, so let's see that mike kiser in the line I can yield to the comment in chat, though, if you want to address Anna's comment first I haven't read it yet, sorry, me a sec I can read it out loud. I'm a little new to this field so sorry if this question is obvious is this about the allowance of profiles in general and implementers make their own and advertise them or the deaf defining of a new standardized profile? This is the first definitely, the first of those. Each Acme server will come up with their own set of profiles. Each of their profiles would control whatever aspects of the certificate they want"

They would document and advertise those profiles themselves So, like, let's encrypts would intend to have a profile reflecting what our certificate issuance looks like today, where we do include client off and our search are validations 90 days, a more modern profile where we don't include client off, we don't include the subject key ID, and those search are still valid for 90 days and eventually a short-lived profile where the certs are on valid for like six or seven days as it's being increased by the web PKI baseline requirements so like some other like intern private PKI ACMECI might have a time totally separate set of things that they care about letting clients pay between and Google Trust services or something a totally separate set of things that they care about letting clients pick between and Google Trust Services or SEC to go or someone else might have a totally separate set of things that they want people to select. There might be a dev versus OV versus EV profile and things like that that Okay, mike ounsworth and trust. My question is, if you've already, implemented this, how open are you to? accepting working group changes? Very. Like, we want this to be a thing that works for everyone. I so come to this with some very strong opinions about what I think is the right solution here because I'm a person with strong opinions. But, like we've been through the process of deploying Acme V1 and then changing our entire implementation to be what we call Acme V2 when the original RFC-555 ended up being standardized, same thing here Okay, then I will try and run this to the entrust dev team get some feedback for you Okay, so hopefully by next meeting we'll have a real draft.

But I think, isn't the pipe coming? into it trusted, so if you can consider that, it would be trusted So I mean the, the big issue here is that there is a long and storied history that continues to like literally three months ago of public trusted CA's taken fields from CSRs and copying them directly into the final certificate because they allow some sort of configuration and customization via CSR and the easiest way for them to do that is to say, oh, you requested the specific thing? Great, let me just copy it over This has been the source of on ongoing CA incidents for the last decade or more And I think anything that allows us to say, no, you shouldn't have to do that, is valuable So even if you trust the transport you still think the CSR can have, yeah, I guess. Right I have bad things in there that are going to cause issues Okay, thanks. Right. My problem is that I don't trust to be code that generates CSRs because it is frequently broken and terrible. Okay, thanks Oh, I thought we all use openness as cell and everything works works So, yeah, I know I trigger all the people with some openness to cell.

And so you can just file a new order request that has a different profile than your most recently passed new order request, and sure, the server can treat that however it wants to. Yeah I mean, it's a good thing because that there You have the operational problem that you have once you're issued a certificate with the profile, you have to maintain it forever If you did so. And what happens if you changed the meaning of the profile? Oh, yeah there's endless complexities.

So Brandon, Thomas, I don't think is here, Carl, who may or may not be here. But the draft Acme Devices test does an excellent job at what it does. It's targeting WebothN I believe it's serving iOS and Android devices It's great, does what it says it does. It's perfect Let's not change it. However, Weboth N is not the only attestation standard. The RAPS Working Group has been furiously putting out stuff and lots of companies are furiously making devices that can attest themselves. And so this is coming And so we should have a discussion about how to carry other types of attestation over Acme that aren't WebOthen In particular, WebOthen is not an IETF standard We have an equivalent, which is called conceptual message wrapper and so this is both both web off CMW for those who aren't in the attestation world they are both wrapper formats at a station at the moment tends to be proprietary. He's the device manufacturer has some binary signed blob. And there's are not typically well standardized, so you need some sort of wrapper format CMW is IETF's wrapper format for that. So then, so obviously we need to figure out how to carry it over Acme. The question then is how and so i think i think there's no debate that we need to carry CMW over Acme that I think is an uncontentious point. The debate is how And so"

Brandon is active in the chat, but it's not really speaking up Ah, there is. My internet drop right as the end of that I was talking talking Yeah, I think you've most correctly interpreted what this was aimed at um it's sort of client devices most likely in an enterprise environment which is kind of where that identity aspect is coming from already kind of implemented on like some more like laptop workstation form factors internally we have some supports slash plans for Linux. MacOS supports this but these are the world I'm coming from is kind of client devices that are using certificates for MTLA for authentication and our uniquely identifiable and being able to issue the certificates to a you uniquely identified device that is already kind of pre-trusted"

We talked about this a bit last time. As you said, right now, all the attestations statement formats are proprietary so there's one for Chrome OS, one for Android, one for iOS, like, and all my draft really tries to do is just like encapsulate the in a key value pair, which doesn't help simplify the implementation of the actual Acme server which will have to implement a per per-vender verifier, which is obviously not great. And my hope is that the work coming out of the Rats working group, will push vendors to common standards So one verifier will be able to verify at a station from multiple different vendor devices And I believe that's kind of what rats is moving towards So I'm actually an author of one of the drafts you're referring to. There's eat which I'm not an author on, entity attestation token which is a seabor claim set and then I'm an author on the P-Kix port of that, which is an a ASN-1 port of that, which is, here's an ASN-1 claim set. Basically, we're trying to overlap the claim and in, we're also adding all the P-11 claims to the, so I'm, I'm, working on that on behalf of the HSM vendors who want to be able to say the device booted in Phipps mode and the key this particular key is not exportable and you know all the P11 things you want to say about it and you we're trying to standardize a format for that so it's not proprietary the question so the debate here is is web i mean really i think the core of the"

Do we want to put CMW? do we want to define how to wrap CMW in? think the core of the debate is, is WebOthen the right top level do we want to put CMW, do we want to define how to wrap CMW inside WebOthen or is that a horrible SDO Franken? And since WebO.N and CMW are both solving the same problem, we should treat the at the same level level To me, I think it would just be easier to have a second, a second draft that defines CMW as the top level I think that is the cleaner long-term outcome But until we get to a world where vendors are actually implementing each I think we're going to kind of be stuck with the verif, like implement and complexity for verifiers But I can speak a little bit for Android because that's the org I'm in at Google. We have our own proprietary attestation statement format. We also have early code or code that implements an early version of EAT sitting in a code repo and it hasn't shipped So I think once that draft, ships we're probably we'll be moving to that. So we've at least one vendor sort of on board I also don't even object to web authentic staying in Acme. Like, you know, Weboth is a great protocol. There's lots of these Ubiki type things that do WebOthen. Maybe those things want certs Seems reasonable Is any, it sounds like we're sort of an agreement. Is there any objection to having two parallel drafts, one for Sam? one for, what about then? I think Carl is the, is the objector, Carl, who's not in voice Aaron is also going to cute, man There's question is there's a willingness in the group to accept these two drafts. Yes Aaron"

I was going to say it is my opinion that identifier types and challenge types are cheap and it is generally better to have more of them that can be more specific and do the thing that they are designed to do rather than how having larger umbrella things with a lot of internal logic and switches within them. I, like, even from like a compliance perspective, right, I would prefer to know that something was verified using device attest o one or web off in a test oh one versus CMW attest o one or you know the names end up being. I'm not expressing any opinions here i would prefer to know that something was validated using a specific challenge method meant to validate that thing rather than, oh yeah, it was validated by a test 01. I don't know what code ran behind a test 01. I've got 10 different code paths back there. It was one of them Like, I would much prefer more specific challenges. Challenge types are free. Identity type fire types are free. I think the second draft is appropriate Okay, this sounds like an interesting discussion to continue on the list If we need to have two documents instead of one, that's also a good thing We probably need a hero to start that draft Thomas volunteered to help. I'm happy to help we discussed what we should name it should we do name it? I think I like the suggestion to name it device attest O2, this is the CMW version, but yeah someone needs to start that draft, so we have something to read and that at. Yeah, we really don't like drafts that have O2 in the name no sorry the the the Acme"

And Brandon said, well, but it's already implemented. How about you do? Oh, device a test 02 for the for the next format, which I think is reasonable, but maybe isn't fully universally acknowledged as good. Anyway, we should write it down, then we have something to happen at. OK Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir So, is there any other other business? Or are we done here? Nobody looks like as they're coming to the mic So I guess we are done here. Oh, wait Sorry, I'm back There's the Acme Automation, Acme Auto Discovery pair of drafts that my colleague, Paul Van Brower-Shaven and I have talked about a few times. We did not submit it update this round We did not request the speaking slot. The drafts aren't dead. We're just entrust us public trust a little busy We haven't done updates, but they're still alive. Don't forget about okay Oh, two more, yeah so I guess Aaron Real quick, I wasn't going to say anything about this but then it came up on the rats' discussion thread like 48 hours ago, so I figured I'd say so someone here, something here I have a further future hope to also create a draft for a public key identifier type so that in the new order request, the client could submit the public key that they want their certificate"

This has two advantages One, it means you don't have to parse the pub key out of the CIS And two, it means that there's an opportunity during validation for the client to prove control over the pub key. For example, by doing a TLS handshake using the private key corresponding to that pub key This, a CSR does not prove possession of a private key. You might have just downloaded that CSR from someone else's GitHub repo and so having a pub key identify type and having challenges that can actually prove control over a public key would be nice for several reasons. But that's a that's future thing that I wasn't planning to talk about but then it came up on the mainland list. So bit, very wait for trying to get rid of the CSER, but of everything in other fields Okay So long-term plan Yes. Okay, hey, I'm Dave Brod everything in other fields. Okay. So long-term plan. Yes. Okay, hey, I'm dave robin. The thing you said about Aramis messages, combined with this last discussion about the verifier, the rats or the web off end, just has been stewing in my head away here. And I'm thinking that a A, I love good error messages. So I'm all in favor of specific why did you reject me I really don't like the use of the word malformed when it has is perfectly well formed you just didn't like one of my fields value. So anyway, that's different. So I like good varimis mess. The reason I came to the mic, though, was talk about these two, these, uh, additions. The web off then, the next one and possibly a rats, or who knows to go on I would prefer to see it was meant mentioned, a rapper of that that says this is my authentic thing.

It says, this is my attestation this is my algorithm name or content name document whatever you want to call it. And here it is, because then when I find one I don't recognize, I get an attestation, I say, I don't know what a XYZ is Z is. I can give you a very specific error message that says, I did that like your attestation. I don't understand it. If you just include a top level field called XYZ that includes this new kind of attestation that I don't know, I don't know whether I'm supposed to reject that or not So I hope that makes sense and I don't what I heard was, oh, I'll just make a proposal and I'll I'll make another proposal, and then a third one will come in, and they're not grouped together under a node in the structure and I think if they're all related, they should be, mainly for the purpose of giving back a good error message I hope that made sense Q Mycel and PIN. Question for Aaron, is this public key? proposal eventually supposed to completely remove the CSR? from Acme? Because that is something I would love to see not brave enough to propose that yet.

There are still a bunch of things I would like to do but there's a bunch of good I can accomplish without having to go that far, including by doing things like Public Key at New Order Time And so I don't think there's any way to fully get rid of the CSR at finalized time until Acme A compliant Acme server would still have to accept a CSR even if it just completely ignores it and drops the back on the floor But yes, it is absolutely my plan for let's encrypt Acme server to drop the bites of the CSR on the floor if we get a public key at new order time. I will accept dropping the CSR as on the floor as an acceptable getting rid of the CSR There are reasonable questions about like hey what about clients that it's an Acme client representing a hardware device and the hardware device API only has a mechanism to out a CSR. Do you want that Acme? client to have to parse the CSR, extract the PubCQ? key, include the Pub key in the new order requirement? I think the answer is no. Like, I kind of want to be willing to just accept a CSR to facilitate that case. I'd rather have my server part the CSR than some Acme client but definitely room for discussion there Yeah, I'm pretty sure that if we do want to get rid of the CSR, it's going to require this document for it 8505. Yes, Mike Aaron, just, this is the last point was exactly what I got in the queue for, which is proof, if we decide a proof of possession is valid and we define an acne specific pop mechanism then yeah exactly what you just said are we forcing like hardware devices to implement the Acme? proof of possession protocol?

They do in some cases provide value that is hard to replicate. And as was pointed out on list, the ACMI client doesn't necessarily have access to the private key That's the more general case here is the ACMI client maybe on a slightly different subnet or whatever. Like you can get the CS to the ACMI client, but you can't necessarily do a full round trip to private key. All those cases become tricky if you take CSR out. That's that. I fully understand why we want to put it out to pasture pasture Tim? Yeah, I was just listening to Mike and I decided I wanted to say we don't necessarily have to actually force hardware devices or everybody to do pop in order to have nice Acme Pop We could just say, this is how you do it if you want to do it forcing people to do it as policy and probably define, belong somewhere else anyway. So just standardize the mechanism and then let some else force people to do it Yeah, that's exactly one of the things that i've been thinking about and one of the reasons that i haven't actually started the draft yet is that I think there's a question of like, you know, if you include the pub key at new order time, is that a way of saying? yes, I can and will do a proof of possession for this? And then, you know, if there's a pub key identifier in the new order, then you have to validate the challenge for that or like would there be something in the draft saying, uh, know pub key proof of possession challenges do not have to be validated in order for the order to be ready to finalize as long as the CA is willing to accept that, you know, there'd be a security consideration section saying this devolves to the old CSR case, or, yeah, so anyway, there's a whole bunch of considerations there This is a little ways out, but I just wanted to sort of lob the idea"
