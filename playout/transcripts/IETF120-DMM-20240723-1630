Then there are some other sections that don't need updates, for example the questions about solar mapping for slicing And if I go to the third point, I mean, it's the need to work with the transport side Again, no updates needed there the questions on control plane and others have already been addressed, and I'll just quickly go through that in the next set of slides. Control Plain and the private network part So just again a quick walkthrough of what has been done and I'll also highlight how we may be able to proceed with this draw without too much linkage to the T's T's So just a very quick overview of the main points in this draft of what this draft is mainly covering is how to do that IP transport I mean, carry the slides in the IP transport such that it is useful in this whole framework that 3GP uses So this is not 3GPP work, but this is how to do the transport slides part that connects different entities like a user plane function or a G GnobB or other control plane functions that are separated by an IP transport transport Just so that this makes more sense I think, you know, the structure is that you have different communications"

Sorry it's a lot of those lot of acrony I didn't create them, but they're there And if you notice, I'll go with the thread of communication service B slice B, and the NSSAI zero they're there. And if you notice, I'll go with a thread of communication service B, slice B, the NSSAI 000B, and the segment below that, the slice instance below that. And in the next slide I'm showing how this is getting, that segment on Slice B how this is getting mapped when the genome BCU on the very left of this figure top figure is going to send a packet, a GTB packet to the UP on the very right. And you can see this configuration, NSSAIB this is an AN network 2. The details is the slides for mapping are then map to can see this configuration, NSSAIB, this is an ANN network two. The details of the slides mapping are then mapped to the IP packet. In this case, we're specific talking about using UDP source port mapping. And the reason for that you can see in the in the segment between the genome bCU and the UPF you see there's a data center network And that data center network has no slice In T's terminology, this is an attachment circuit. So this is the specific case that this draft is addressing. And the other techniques that are used that TEAS is now elaborating on in another draft is talking about VLAN, MPLS SRV6, all of which need an attachment"

Yeah, these are just showing the updates for the control plan private networks license I mean, this has been shown before, but if any of you have questions I'd be very happy to go over the details. Again, removal of PPR showing status of the network. As I mentioned, you know the AMS now to make clear about that attachment circuit and what this draft falls and what the other drafts and T's do.

I found the other draft mentioned about your mobility transport in the RTG working group. So do you know that? or what's the relation between the transport-aware mobility draft? Okay, that's a good question There is a very loose relationship in terms of only the technique of using UDP source port. But that work is really talking about the N6 network. So if you wanted to you know, use a slice outside of the Trichik that work is really talking about the n6 network so if you wanted to you know use a slice outside of 3Gpp so n6 really then there's a suggesting that there is a way to do that using the techniques that are in the product.

My name is Ming-Gong and today I present our document Computing Aware Jafis Theory consideration for mobile user play architecture. Next way document basement is about mobile user play architecture for DMM DRAB, another type inside the work group. And this document proposed a map controller to converse mobility sessions information into data plan routing information So our target for this document is that we want to propose that this map architecture can be leveraged to address the option routing program in Mantis Suite in the network scenario. So inside the previous meeting, we set that the goal of the draft is ending service scenario, but after we revise the goal it should be the multiple service in the network scenario So the brief introduction about this network scenario is that multiple service is incidents of the same service running in the different locations. And to select the optimal route, is important to consider the network and the circuit metric related to each instance. It also is a problem discussed in the CAD Working Group, and this is the map architecture can be liberated to address that Next slide Thank you want. So to let's make sure that that's previous one"

So we forget there are three things that it need to be enhanced. First, it needs to identify the service and is candidate location And you can refer from the catwalking group. We can use the case service ID to identify, to differentiate, different services and we can use a cast intensive ID to differentiate different instances of the same service. The second thing is advertise the service department information and one of the possible solution is proposed in the Internet routing rule looking rule. They introduce VGP and RIN that store the CSI and the CSID information of the S services and a target aggregate. So that the aggregator can advertise the service department information to other components inside the model architecture if this solution is used. The third one is an emphasized service-mach information. Another drop inside the inter-domain hooking group proposed a solution that a metadata which be part architecture, a part attribute which consists of several subtil-bs that contains different caste metric of the S service and protected web router. By this way, the matrix can be advertised to the map architecture. Here you go to the next slide slide So this is how we think the market architecture can be enhanced to support case capability. So basically we keep the true original ground that has been proposed inside the mall architecture that is a direct statement route and the session charge from route and the new route need to be added it is a metric update route.

Then to advertise the major appetite, the direct segment extend quality ID of the direct statement and the corresponding SFB6 SID of the PE. Then to advertise the metric, then the META update route needs to be used and this route is also advertised from the PE that attached to the direct statement. But this route not going to the other side PE, it's go to the controller. And the information needs to be included inside this drive is a direct segment extend community ID that the service incident is located on then is CSID is CIS ID and the matrix And the candidate solution inside inter-doming routing group can be used for that. And the third is a session transformed route, a little bit of a modified modification here is that because the controller decides all ultimate instant, then the session transform route need to attack the optimal direct statement extend committee ID to the to the transform route to advertise to the PE on the ZenoB side route to advertise to the PE on the Xenobie side. And one more information that needs to be added inside this transform route is the CSS ID. So that when the PE at the ZD. It received the packet, it received the system transform route, then it can transform the packet It can change the destination to the CSS ID And after that, it incalculated with the set statement list that go to the corresponding PE of the Automata Direct Segment Next slide slide John? Yeah, so. Hey, one, sir. Yeah, go ahead. Can I ask a quick clarifying question in the previous slide. Okay.

So CSID is what you guys have defined? or is it in the other specs? Sorry CSID is what this spec is defined? CSID is unique ID certified inside the cat working role Is that a ID encoded in string or binary or something? For current right now, the cat working work they are still finalized and still working on what will be the optimal representation for the case of the ID. It can be the IP, but it can also be another way Either inter-domain routing route or the routing area booking group, they also have another draft that looking on this one In summary that it is still on the ongoing work and there has been no clear I think that John's question is where you find the CSID in the session information in the mobile core So which session information you mean? yeah i i i i'm okay so I think if we deploy a multiple service instance and you want to represent it, then we need to represent it, then we need to have some kind of similar thing to DNA We can translate the service ID to multiple contacts to contact instant ID, see it so it must be proper to the network operator"

So there is a missing path between a user plane anchor and the data network which we discuss in the draft And solutions to tackle that have actually been addressed in DMM and other groups a long time ago already. But now this kind of use cases behind these solutions get a little bit more traction and people have good ideas and that justifies more documentation and maybe even doing some standardization work were required We had discussion between various IETF meetings and it IETF 1-17 we could have a public site meeting where even people outside of the MM working group came and provide good comments fair comments also about limit people outside of the MMM working group came and provided good comments, fair comments, also about limitations of what we had in mind. So all of that goes into the draft. Of course, it's not yet too mature, but a good amount of information is in the draft and there seems to be growing into. So let's see if we can do something more in the email Just to summarize, the basic scenario comes up If you see a mobile communication system on the left, and we abstract from well, the basic scenario comes up. If you see a mobile communication system on the left, and we abstract from well-known cellular systems like 3TP, but it's fully in line with it, right? So we don't want to interface but complement these systems to have advanced use case in today and in the future so you see a mobile control plane, you have a radio access network, and one of them are two use case in today and in the future. So you see a mobile control plane, you have a radio access network and one or multiple user plane anchors. So all that can be matched to 3GPV architecture, but it's not dependent on. So we look actually at the right-hand side. And one example is that mobile devices, user plan anchor gets relocated mid-session"

Advanced scenario even consider a mobile device which has multiple parallel user plane anchors, maybe serving the same mobile device IP, and you need to steer traffic based on policies. So all that are advanced scenarios which we discuss. Traffic steering of non- non-routable IP. So you need to do something in the transport net need to steer traffic based on policies. So all that are on scenarios which we discuss. Traffic steering of non-routable IP. So you need to do something in the transport network to bring these packets from its source to its destination, which is a mobile and all of them need to traverse the user plane anchor So these are basically the scenarios we look at a set of use cases that we described so far we show later on. Also network function of femorality and mobility it's use cases which people discuss today. So you may have on pathcom components which are not always present or static. So they may move, they may disappear for energy reasons. So all of that is a good reason to steer traffic in a different way and hopefully in a controlled way. If I may ask it but you're clarifying question traffic steering of non-roadable IP? What use case? So if you for example, have a mobile user which gets an IP address assigned, which is toppled topologically anchored at a user plane anchor and you change that anchor point. So that new anchor may not be in the network matching that IP address so you need to steer it so you need a host route for that or other mechanisms For non-routable IP I was asking about the non-routable IP what is non-routable so you cannot route it in the correct way by default so you need hosts runs.

So there is a lot of existing work. But in the view of these use cases, there may be additional features to be added to these data planes and forwarding planes for example to tackle reordering problems and in the there is a draft on that which addresses an important point for these use cases and so forwarding plane aspect is something the draft could also take in look at and see if there's some clarification what's the different between the data plan and forwarding plan? what's the difference between the data playing and the forwarding point Forwarding plane? Well, it's a protocol applying to the data plane Oh, I see. Yeah. It's a brand new idea What's the difference? I didn't care about that.

They don't there's only data network, right? So now your interface point to ease the transfer control, right? It's more an API-based interface right? So technically, if you want to steer something on the N6, right, the transport controller to touching the N6 node is the only interface correct? Yes. We have the two architect options which shows this N6 interface in the controller and where we see work to be done on the next slide okay Exactly.

So that's another option where at DPN as a router can be tied control plane, but from the user plane anchors. That's another option where a DPN as a router can be tightly coupled with the user plane anchor and interactions between these two functional elements is something that are could be looked at in terms of an information model and in the view of the target use cases Okay, lessons learned first draft. So we have a couple of things learned during this discussion and the feedback that we received. Current work we focus on architecture options semantics in between the different nodes that are relevant in these architecture and data plane optimization considerations. Starting point in the draft currently is to have a reference architecture because we don't want to interfere but be compatible with any mobile communication system so we need to reference architecture with generic terms but this does not interfere but really is compatible with well-known mobile communication systems documentation on advanced use cases and this is not celerated, so there is based for 012 more use cases that we discuss these days documentation of entry and architecture and deploy options, it's in, but more text and figures could be provided.

This section is still to be done, but if there is interest, I think there is a lot of meat in the bag of our heads which can be written down an updated version Next slide very important again we had actually the plan to publish this earlier that was really tight with the deadline, so we currently have all the contributing people mentioned in the acknowledgement which hopefully will be on board of this document as co-authorization for the contributors. Next one So next is to be a bit more agile here and publish version 1 in September with more details and analysis and also a specification"

And if there is group entry, I think there is also energy from the different people to progress such work Thank you okay Luigi I have two questions. First is... Please do your name please. Luigi, I stated What will the mobility control plane look like? What, what? be beyond the box? I mean generally you have a control plane look like what what will be beyond the box I mean generally you have a control plane system that treats handover reachability security, these kind of aspects Advanced architectures have dedicated gateways to allow a third parties to read or write information to the control pane. If we refer to 5G and 3GP, there is, of course, the AMF, the SM That's a control plan of the mobile communication system. If you refer to that kind of gateway, there is the NF functions which can be used by outside components. Does that clarify? OK, can you go back to slide? three, I think, or four? When there is the general scenario at the beginning This is perfect Now, if you change the act acronym upa to XTR, if you change mobility control plane, to LISP mapping system, then you have LISP Now, LISP is standard track. Maybe it does not answer all the requirements that you have. For example, it doesn't look at all to packet reordering"

But if you go forward with this kind of work, you definitely need to compare to LISP and say why LISP is not enough because otherwise the problem has been solved all already. Then you may choose to enhance LISP or not. It's up to you But yeah, have a look Yeah, LISP we spend a couple of thoughts and I also had a discussion with the up to you. But yeah, have a look. Yeah, Lisp, we spend a couple of thoughts. And I also had a discussion with Dino on this kind of deployment. And well, yeah, you may apply LISP on this N6 reference point here, but it has constraints right? And so you may treat the DPA, the current DPA as a location but what if you have multiple locators if you have multiple UPA is operated in parallel and you want to have some traffic here, some traffic here And some traffic here may be the case that you have a UPA which is associated with a non-terrestrial network node, right? which may disappear. So you need to be an adjoins here which is associated with a non-terrestrial network node, right, which may disappear. So you need to be a HR. I mean, you can do that in principle with Lace, but that's beyond the point My real point is have a look, because even if you go if this work goes on, I mean, at some point, that will be internet and IESG review. And the same question will come up Why not LISP? So, does the list is based on... Be ready and answer already the question in your draft, so you are done. Oh, definitely we will look at it but also i see constraint in the mapping base, right? Which is that transport nodes pull the state of the EID2 locator mapping, right? So there is no way yet, maybe it will be in the future, to put an updated state to these data panels, right? Go ahead. Actually, it's not too, because we have a publish a subscribe solution so you subscribe and whatever update you want, you will receive it"

Again, we don't want to be specific on a particular solution for that transport and this is definitely something we could look at. So if I may comment on that, right, is the key discussion? steering to a particular o'clock that's the only difference isn't it? if i may comment on that right is the the key discussion steering to a particular r lock that's the only difference is steering the packet to a particular r lock right that's all that's the only difference right It's a semantics. My point is, on N6, when you do steering, right? We steer it to the new UPF in this case we steer it to a given R lock routing the locator sorry that's that's only difference. Yeah, but really, it to the new UPF. In this case, we steer it to a given oddlock, routing locator. That's the only difference. Yeah, but really, this scenario is completely overlapping this Completely, except for the argument. Then maybe there are other requirements that obviously are not in this slide that are needed. I don't know you can discuss further, but this is common this is a based scenario so the more advanced you cases, we can look at if this business is really good solution to. But how the mapping look up? is done is different right in this case the mobile control plane is pushing that N6 steering state but in case of list somebody has to insert that mapping state and now on a user plane and a packet arrives you're looking up the map lookup. No, no so the map being itself you can register once you create a map, you register. Then the other side if it is interested he expressed the interest, and he has received up the update whenever they are available so so I mean again I'm not saying you have to use Leipos or absolutely not but there is a lot of overlap and you better cloud"

We don't want to reinvent a wheelwright If there is IETF work that can be reused, we will reuse it Okay, so I think last time there was this point from about the charter, right? So we had a brief look and if the group has interest in working on that, we don't think rechartering was necessarily required, but maybe a milestone needs to be added. So there are a couple of statements which fit to that work, so forwarding path and signaling These kind of paragraphs, I think they can be matched to this, but maybe there are other views I think it's a major thing to reach harder, right, but if we can add a milestone I think my view then let's settle this on speak about overall i think two things we need to make sure. Are we stepping on 3GB? In the given the drencic's note, I'm slightly a bit comfort right personally I have to discuss with Sartorlissan but overall, yeah, looks okay, but I think in general we need to from any new work we want to issue an LS to 3GP and make sure they are okay with that that's one thing right and then you have to make sure it's in charters Then the third most important thing is there's sufficient interest in the work. If these steps are made, I think, I'll look so I think it would be good to study whether the architecture or some sort of the framework be standardized But finally, at the end, we have to adapt the exact solution to make things happen So let's study whether we can reach that level of the year we have to adopt the exact solution to make things happen. So let's study whether we can reach that level of the work. That's me, my opinion Well, I think a fundamental decision we need to do not later, but now is how much will you be?"

Okay, so if you assume the CPP, how you assume UPF re-anchoring? I don't assume 3GPP. I assume a mobile communication control plane okay so what a mobile communication system assume? So in the real world? Well, something We are working on IETF, running code and rough consensus so what you assume as a running system well we may develop a running system based on PMAP, I don't know Well, the point is we try to close it running system? Well, we may develop a running system based on P-map. I don't know. Well, the point is we try to close the gap, which we found in current PPS system. Okay, if you ask, okay, my question know. Well, the point is we try to close the gap, which we found in current PPS system. Okay, if you ask, okay, my comment is if you assume it's 5G, 5G doesn't see much scenario for you UPF re-anchering. So in that scenario, how you assume UPF re-enquering be happen in the real world? That's my question It's not clear But 3GP specs are not frozen, right? There is an evolution even the next generation being discussed. Okay so you love different ideas on which you cases make sense and hopefully the future mobile communication system will bring support for them.

On N9 N9 is inside the core. Inside the core, okay That's only, no, but even the Marcos scenario is re-anchoring is within the core. The steering is outside from N6 the Marco's scenario is re-anchoring is within the core. The steering is outside . This is only one in use case, right? Look at the other use case where we don't have UPF relocation is re-anchoring is within the code. The steering is outside . This is only one in one use case, right? Look at the other use cases where we don't have UPF. Okay, so without anchored why you need steering to change the anchor from the outside of the core? Well, as said before, there may be use cases where you have multiple user plane anchors And one may be a light weight one, another one every weight, and then you may receive traffic from different sources. So you may want to decide policy base which UPA use for which traffic Okay. Which means you need to steer it. There was another comment. Was there a comment? Rashmit from Bowie, Canada.

I mean, either you go to three and argue for new use cases, then you start in SA1, with new use cases, then you bring it to a SA2. And then still we have the gap of the non-3-GPP part, right?

Both. Both, okay If there are use cases in the draft which don't make sense, of course, its versions zero, we can revise according to the needs and the view of the working group.

So adopting is working group. And also the defined, adopt a solution is out of scope of this work, right? Which solution? So adopting the exact solution is out of scope Well, we have currently a section on design recommendations and information models So information models may apply between the mobile community system control plane and the transfer network control plane, according to the use cases to support them. So that's something we consider so it may be that that may be the specification part in the document so you define the information model, data model with that the exact protocol That's why we said information model If there is something more concrete, it can be extended to what the API that applies to 3DPP, for example"

Okay, thank you, yeah Yeah, answer. Oh, yeah, here I use that, the never sliding part of analogy I don't see, okay, well, we're going to use the same here. I use that network slicing part of analogy. I don't see, okay, well, we are going to use the similar technologies, but remember, next slide thing is a part of analogy. I don't see, okay, well, we're going to use the same technologies. But remember, next slide thing is, I think the really 17 is a long time back But here, this is for future, 6G evolution So it's not like Apple to peer comparison but just a give analogy for the past that can be achieved from IETF future 6G evolution. So it's not like an apple-to-peer comparison, but just give analogy for the past that can be achieved from the IETF to 3GP otherwise reference guide Okay, so yeah, yeah, I know that, so we are now going to input the requirements to the 360 I think so it's already 19 or 2820 20"

I wanted to say that this draft does provide useful information about some optimizations I think the way it's framed though is that it's providing suggestions to 3GPP And I think that's the part where it would be useful to frame it as you know there are some advantages to do it X, Y, and Z and then leave it up to 3GPB2 data off. I mean, you know, putting it as we right, I mean, it's too close a connection and it almost looks like a that the IETF is recommending something. So if we leave that connection out, I think there is valuable options and optimizations that are suggested in this. How you do that is okay. Thank you, John. Slish. Last thanks, John. So I think like, I agree with like what John said that as part of also my concern like you know kind of we like provide this kind of say hey, you should do this, but not really calling other John said that as part of also my concern, like, you know, kind of, we, like, provide this kind of say, hey, you should do this, but not really calling out the implementation stuff, right? Like, so, and just to follow up on such san's thing i don't think like i think like Saterosan meant it, but just make sure that that's clear that it is not a barrier for adoption, the existence of an implementation is not a barrier for adoption, but like personally for me, after reading the draft, it's not clear what needs to get implemented.

Okay, next Okay, next time I'm going to cover this emergency. I'll take a very short time on this Yeah, this is not in the charter at this time I think the key discussion point are you want to get some feedback on, you know, what we need to do around this. I think the use case that I'm looking at is like, you know, how we can enable emergency 911 or 112 calling over Wi-Fi networks That's a scenario that we have. Today, if you look at it, emergency calling is only supported in cellular networks So I gave an update in the last IETF. There are some new additions, right?

I don't access network credentials, meaning I do not have the password or for this society that's very I am I'm in a mall or in some environment public, you know, in a mall. Can I make that emergency call using a native dialer That's the scenario we have in mind now I think from the the technical elements if you look at it what we want is that can I take a device, let's say I pull out my Samsung and Android device If I any time I press a 911 or 112, do I automatically discover? a network which supports emergency services? and will I be able to latch onto that network? with only one and only one purpose to make that emergency call? That's all. That is the objective. I'll not be allowed to do anything else but make that one single call. That is the scenario. In this so the elements from the solution point of view how do i discover a network and which supports emergency services right maybe perhaps using emergency passpoint profiles that definition of emergency passpoint profile is not there yet, but can we define a passpoint profile with some special characteristics, which is exclusively which allows me to discover an emergency? network and this past point profile should be bundled as part of when device manufacturers like apples and Samsung or Microsoft and they make a build a device"

Is that location a trustworthy location? Meaning, I can make a road call sitting here and saying I'm in San Francisco How can, you know, the emergency system be be in a position to know that this call is coming from a real location? These are some of the considerations then the other issue is when I use a native dialogue, not an app, when I make a native dialer when I press a 911 or 112, what is the backend infra that supports? the SIP termination, SIP call? So these are some of the elements, like how do you do? detect a rogue user? Now, I think overall from the solution elements point, of view, this is one type of architecture, I think meaning, the baseline assumption is there's a pass point profile, which is supported across various Wi-Fi roaming architecture right, even cellular in one sense, right? So, passpoint profile is the enabler It allows me to discover a network. This is common for across, if you take Edo roam or open roaming or you know five other roaming architectures, in all of these, the common element is a passport profile. So the starting point here is can we standardize something right can we make recommendations for you know enabling you know, come out with the definition part, I mean point here is can we standardize something, right? Can we make recommendations for, you know, enabling, you know, come out with the definition for emergency passpoint profile? Now, that will be the basis where it will work across all of these rooms architectures meaning a user in such in a given situation will be able to latch onto the network and make that call.

This rulemaking is under review So here, what does it mean? The cloud that I'm showing here is designated by an FCC, right? This is only, there's an identity provider there, meaning this identity provider, when I bring in my emergency device with an emergency passpoint profile when I activate that right? it will the signaling happens to the time identity provider the access network will signal the location to the identity provider. Now when I make an emergency call, the call termination will happen on the DCS-CF or the emergency SIP server So this is the overall, you know, architecture I think a brief discussion on, I think, you know, the past point profile, I think, you know, a few things. I think this is where why EETF has to look into this, right? Passpoint profiles have a certain structure, there's an order right? Now, where does an emergency pass point? profile fit into this right there's no order right It's an invocation of the emergency passport profile is explicit, meaning I press based on my input right if I press 9-1-1 I activate that profile. If I call my wife, that profile should not be activated right that the intent is is very, it has to be explicit. I want to make an emergency call, that profile has to be activated now so that means that we have to make a recommendation right when we do define an emergency passport profile where it fits in the list of profiles. What is the ordering, right? how does that get invoked right in some countries, then as emergency call is not by a native dialogue but you know based on a specific designated application"

Now, in the context, of emergency passpoint profile i take my device let's say i'm right now, I'm in US citizen, I'm in Canada what is my profile? When I'm making a number, I'm roaming in one sense right now in this sense what emergency profile should i use is it a canadian emergency profile or a North America, United States? profile? So there has to a local element in the profile right i think these are and there has to be some additional materialite elements which marks the profile as an emergency profile These are all some of the elements in the puzzle Now I think I this is an example, like, you know, if you look at it, Apple as, like, in some, devices, when you press some specific hotkeys, right? a special screen pops up, right? Here, can this be a trigger to select the emergency pass? profile? Right, I think these are some of the other discussion points now location considerations you know in all emergency systems, location is central to everything right? I think this is where, there's a touch relation to the work in dmm because in the context of mobility, location is fundamental you allow when before we provide mobility we allow the device to latch on to the network then you know we know the network knows the location so I think this is one touch point but but coming back to the emergency calling location is central to yeah okay so to"

Is it 90% possible that? the last reported location is 5 minutes? back or 1 minute back? What is the conference level? I think so in all of this, you know, the central to this I think a few, this slide is not yeah, I think the question is, if you look at, when I make a sip call, there's some sip headers, I can indicate some location, right? But that look yeah, I think the question is, if you look at, when I make a SIP call, there's some SIP headers, I can indicate some location, right? But that location may or may not be accurate, because the, depends on the device. Now here, this is where the touch point is. Let the device report what it is right? But on the back end, the access network will also report a location that way the emergency system will be able to cross correlate between the location that's reported by the end endpoint and the access network is same so this is the way to know whether the location that is getting reported to the network is the right location or not right reported by the endpoint and the access network is same. So this is the way to know whether the location that is getting reported to the network is the right location or not. I think the another thing is if access network can provide a signed location to the device, then that can itself can be used to index the location meaning like in the flow is something like you know I'm make a I make it go call, I'm connected, I make a call I have some specific location that that emergency voice system, the SIP server, will be able to do a little dip based on the tag that I provide And if I'm connected to the right access, network, if the access network has reported that location to the database, location database, the subscribe location can be retrieved, right? But if I, my tag is in, is not something I, randomly generated the location dip will fail right so there was to see my tag is in is not something I randomly generated the location dip will fail right so there are ways to solve the location problem and in the right manner That is one thing i think this about the dynamically generated location tax i think now there are two scenarios right I think I"

Now, when I make an emergency, call how does emergency system discover the location right in one case if both are everything is under one realm meaning the identity provider and the voice services are in one realm the location is you know straight straightforward. But if there are two different, entities, meaning the pass point profile that I use, let's say for its IETF passpoint profile, now I make it emergency call my call terminates in the SIP services in the cloud that's somewhere else, FCC designated how does that entity look up the location database right this is where I think you know we are suggesting some NAPTER you know DNS records right based on that you based on the in the zip headers there's some realm information based on that you discover the location where you make a DNS query and subsequently do a location dip based on the water the station is providing these are some of the elements i think in the overall solution puzzle, I think think, my mouse is not moving I think just to illustrate, I think, you know, what we are building is probably maybe in next idea for something, we'll be able to maybe in the hackathon we want to demonstrate the whole thing, right?

So there are two scenarios, John. I think, you know if you look at today's cellular stuff right now, even expats sim somebody with an expert sim can make a call right In one sense, there's no subscription relation. They're all year are providing is an IMIA in one sense, right? Now, coming back to, I think, based on the FCC discussion there's an interest to know the where the call is coming from. I think, but that change based on the regulatory domain maybe if you go to China the view will be different versus what we say in the United States, right? or canada right so you have to support multiple models when we make a sip call one approach is every device and apples and Samsung they already have a device certificate, right?"

So maybe I misspoke, you know, it's not IMEI that I was intending more like a Supi or an Insy. Yeah, for Supi or Suji, I think then certificate-based signing. If the device has a radio, you know, app installs a cert or Samsung installs a search on the device by default when they make that SIP headers are to be signed using that private keys of that. That way the receiving entity knows that, okay, this is an Apple in signed by Apple installed cert, right?

Sort of different questions with different hats. First, no hats question The, your overall proposal, I know I've asked this before, and I apologize for not remembering um you are not proposing any protocol extensions or any new things. Everything you are doing here is assembling things that already exist Yeah, yeah. So then one possible strategy is to go to the independent stream editor. Say that again, Eric"

Because you're not asking for any protocol changes You're just mixing a bunch of stuff that already exists Right, right, right. So, and then, so no hats again, but, well an author hat, to double check, you the thing that is the look entity that needs to be located is the source API address of the SIP call. Is that correct? yeah i'm having a slight a hard time actually I don't know why. Yeah, sorry, I couldn't. I'm sorry, the entity to be identified is the source IP address of the SIP call Yes, that's one transport identified. Yes. And that IP address is allocated to the mobile device after its passport association correct? Yes, yes, yes. So in that case, I think if the Passpoint Association is an emergency use-only network. Yeah is it's appropriate then to advertise location for those IP addresses because that should only be handed out to people who need to make emergency calls. So that's- fair. In that case, I think you can use RFC805 for those IP addresses, because that should only be handed out to people who need to make emergency calls. So that's fair. In that case, I think you can use RFC 8805, right, which is self-published to you geofeeds. And so as long as you have texts, it's says, there's privacy exposure here but this is overridden by the fact that this is in British you have text that says there's privacy exposure here, but this is overridden by the fact that this is an emergency call and these IP addresses should only be allocated to device that are using this passport profile to make an emergency call I think you could maybe get around the privacy concerns that way right? That's a great solution. So then just say, anybody, your SIP provider just has to have these IP addresses published in an RFC 8805 format. You then have another controlling problem of how to discover those but at least that information can be published on a provider by basis. That makes absolutely sense, yeah Thank you so much.

We have a UPF here with two Ginovs and the UE is moving from Ginov 1 to Ginobee 2 So when the, when the happens, the UPF is that from Geno B1 to Geno B2. So when that move happens, the UPF establish a new GTP tunnel to the GenoB 2 to start sending the downing traffic towards Geno B2 At this time, it also sends the end marker on the O tunnel to Geno B1 And then Geno B1 will finish sending its in-flight traffic for the UE to and then it sends a forward and market to Geno B2 Before the Geno B2, guess that Geno B2 gets that end marker, it will hold the data that it was receiving from the UPF. And when it received the end marker, Geno B2 will release the data This is to ensure the package is delivered in order. Next slide Now, if we are using distributed UPF, then this and marker mechanism is not enough Typically, the UPFs are centrally dependent but so for edge computing purposes where the load latency is required we either use UL, cell UP together with central UPS or we just completely distribute the UPS as shown in this picture where we have the UPF1 and UPF2 distributed and then when you have distributed UPF, then the data network is also distributed And in that case, the different, the, network locations will be connected with a"

So this two are actually sort of relight so to support persistent addresses, one way to do is that those UPFs, they were at a time per UE routes. In this example, the HAPE will maintain all the per UE routes, but it only has an aggregate route towards us this example, the HAPE will maintain all the per UE routes, but it only has an aggregate route towards the outside world. Other PEs for example, P.E.1 and PE2, they do not need to hold those per UE routes.

Because those PEs are not the 5GS functions, we cannot use an end marker to address the packet ordering issue and this draft talks about one way to address that problem. Next half, please Um, so basically, um, actually, please go back to the other slide. I'll just talk about it in this picture So the moment the HAPE installs the per UE routes so that it sent traffic towards P.E it will send the ICMP map message towards UPF1 That ICMP message is basically a trigger for UPF1 to send the end marker. So the UPF1 gets the end marker trigger, it was send an end marker towards CNOB1 B1. Geno B1 will forward it to Geno B4 4. And so that Geno B 4 will hold the traffic that it receives the hub towards Genobi 1. Genobi 1 will forward to Genobi 4.

So we do have some questions to ask our ourselves and ask our operators How important is the endmarking mechanism now? we do have some questions to ask ourselves and ask our operators.

And another thing is people may ask that if you need a hub router to initiate the end marker process why bother with just using UPFs? Just use the ULCL UPF.

There are all those slides talking about that in the draft and in the slide deck. I don't think I'm going to finish all those slides here. I just want to bring this up because this is actually the draft published a year ago, I never presented it. Today, I want to bring it out and that people know that this exists, so please take a look at the draft and the and the slides and think about uh whether this is a problem that we want to solve and whether the solution is good, things like that So I think with that I'll just end my presentation here. Thank you so much Any questions, comments? John? A very quick comment. As we heard just before, you know, if you're introducing buffering and delays, then of course the end marker would be needed. But equally you know, the statement that you made earlier that networks are getting faster and faster"

    "text": "so you're essentially going to make the problem sometimes worse by buffering this up I wonder if we should also consider, you know, the other advancements like, you know, multi-path TCP and actually parallel connections that will not introduce these kind of a bottom in the middle So I don't know the answer to this, but it's just a thought Yeah, one thing about multipass TCP is that that may work for the IP scenario, but 5G also supports even at the PDU, and that is something that we still need to handle Because Ethernet PDU, you basically have a persistent mechanism addresses, no matter how you do it I think my comment would be if you do something in IETF, let's generalize it to make it access agnostic, right? Find a bit more use cases than if you solve it here, that will be perfect That way, we can take it to 3GB and say, yeah this is a generic spec, use this mechanism, right? If you limit to 3GP, we'll have a problem i think that's the way i look at it i think we should generalize it maybe in Wi-Fi systems all in Wi-Fi 7-8, there's same same scenario as applicable. So maybe we should think broadly Just a quick comment. So I think it's similar directions as we had for mobile traffic steering, right? Which network we see in the on the mobile side and here we move a problem that has been solved in the 3TP access network towards end right? So I think when people see about forwarding and buffering, so they think about buffer bloat. And we are not talking about, you know, but about routers and UPF functions So this kind of UPF or UPA to UPA kind of relocation the question is if we look at more advanced scenarios so if that may be notes that are not static in the topology like satellites, for example"

    "text": "which may have a base station plus a U.P so referring to the end of kind of syn So if we don't have user mobility, but actually UPF mobility, we have the same problem here so maybe we can at least touch these kind of advanced use case to see if at marker concept may make sense in such a kind of deployment Yeah, very quick clarification The buffering does not happen on the router. It still happens on the genome beads. We're basically just using a new mechanism to trigger the end-marker process Okay. Okay. Thank you, everyone I think we need to, we are slightly four minutes over. Thank you so much. And my apologies, I took a couple of minutes of your time. OK Thank you so much. Everyone, with this, we wrap up the call Thank you. Thank you you so much I'm asking for you"
