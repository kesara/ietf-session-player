    "text": "the way back to the original passport was created this is obviously a problem very similar to one that we have long studied in sip history info and that the classic diversion header provided ways to kind of capture the places you had gone through one of the things that makes our situation a bit different is that we merely need to have a signature that will still apply to whatever the canonicalized result is of the identifier x\u0027 that are in a safe message and consequently a lot of the like really minor transformations like if you change the entire domain name right in URI it\u0027s a big deal for like diversion but if the user part is cellphone number it is completely inert to us and we can still use exactly the same regional passport you change the domain name 57 times and transit that is very interesting property of the way that our canonicalization stuff works but it\u0027s also an explanation for why we\u0027re not actually using things like history and fill our divergent but instead are using this new mechanism and it may work for things like sip brandy if we ever do that next so obviously the basic idea behind this is that when a sip call say containing a passport arrives at an entity that\u0027s going to do a retargeting that diverting entity has its own authentication service that will then create this new passport and this entity interesting enough when it creates this new passport doesn\u0027t sign for the originating number because it course doesn\u0027t doesn\u0027t probably own the originating number it might but that would not be a safe assumption to make instead it ends up signing over the destination because presumably it has authority over the original destination that\u0027s why the call landed there in the first place next slide so you can kind of get a sense of what this would look like from this for an original passport that has kind of thought the first target you then end up with this new passport you see at the bottom which in the div claim down there has the original target stuck into that and you have instead this new destination you were targeting to in the destination and you could of course then reach a new place we thought we targeted again in which case you had build yet another one of these but ultimately these would all glom into separate identity headers and sip and as a relying party is a verification service you\u0027ll be able to evaluate each one of those and walk this all the way back the chain that lets you be sure that it was supposed to get to you in the first place and remember I mean this is this is important to our use case among other things because we use the desk to prevent a certain class of cut-and-paste attack right but we don\u0027t want you to be able to do is to you know if I send a you know sip invite to Acker and the destination is occur and an attacker cut and paste no cut and paste that identity and sends it to Joe like Joe should people look at this and say wait a minute this thing like was to Eckhart not me and so therefore I know this person trying to impersonate John probably that is the idea now of course the problem is retargeting makes that very complicated and what we\u0027re trying to capture here is a way that you could if you were determined to go back and look through these passports and make the necessary cryptographic chain next slide you know I mean this this is not rocket science I think this one um you "

    "text": "what we lose our two things one the privacy component the CPS knows who you are knows your IP address is tied to that telephone number pretty much the second thing we lose is the Gateway case right because the Gateway won\u0027t possess the certificate that allows you to upload passports for that given number and so weighing this I think we\u0027re gonna come up with something along those lines to do it I\u0027m not gonna try to do justice to this myself Macker can do that a little later but next slide so that\u0027s the the upload side so they kind of to summarize the good news of upload is you know that the the authentication isn\u0027t as much of a problem as you\u0027d think because the passport itself right has a signature in it and it\u0027s not going to be accepted as valid by anyone unless that signature is valid and it doesn\u0027t matter who you know delivers it to you you could find it as I\u0027m fond of saying written on a piece of paper in a bus stop right provided the signature valid a stand that is a valid passport and so you know you don\u0027t have to worry that much about authentication again provided you can then lick this DDoS problem so now they\u0027re retrieval side and this is what we have in the draft today the draft spends a lot of time discussing this there are three semantics we consider for kind of what the question is you ask when you receive a call so put yourself in the verification services choose here a pots call has just come in you\u0027re seeing a calling party number in it you know your telephone number you and let\u0027s just say for the sake of argument you know how to find a CPS that there\u0027s only one in the world we\u0027ll assume that for the sake of this argument what do you ask the CPS and this a lot of this question comes down to what information do we want to try to keep from the cps and what information do we want to try to reveal to it and so we have three potential semantics we discuss in the draft today they have three very different security implications if we kind of assume that you\u0027re gonna have to authenticate yourself to the CPS in order to be eligible to receive these calls from it something like a B probably makes a lot of sense because it\u0027s you\u0027re already gonna have to reveal that information to the CPS anyway if you\u0027re saying I want receive calls from my number and to prove that I should receive calls from my number I\u0027m going to give you my certificate that shows I own this number or maybe the service rider certificate that shows I own and ocn that contains that number yes Martin okay Martin Dali so I think I haven\u0027t read the strap but looking thinking of the use case just based on your figure the originating ue nor the originating network will know at the time where they would potentially do signing of whether you\u0027re going to hit a PSTN gateway and go through the scenario that you\u0027re talking about and so so potentially you could have a situation whereby you know you\u0027re you\u0027re going to get you know the the passport coming "
