    "text": "only the publisher and consumer needs to know about it so we are throwing that information in there so that the controller can make sense out of it implementation status so whatever we have talked about so far we have already implemented the proxy functions on the open source hardware we have implemented the the on Linux and on FDI o VBB software we have also implemented the static proxy on Cisco hardware and and that particular demo will be out there and you know in the end on the on Cisco\u0027s web side we also have s are aware open source work which is going on with some research universities and that will be available very soon so we will have services which are fully capable of segment routing processing once those are unable then that particular service itself becomes a node in a whole segment routing solution so once that service will be able to send the information to the controller then the information can be put together by the controller just like any other node so this is this is this is the solution which we are proposing for sharing any comments feedback under here again yes kayuu patel arcus I have actually question for a chair for chairs couple of IDF\u0027s back Robert and I presented a draft called vector routing which was based which is intended for service aning I I have a faint recollection I might be wrong but back then the working group had said that service chaining work was not within the Charter of this working group has that changed at that I recall the same situation that was going to be one of my next comments I need to talk to my ad on whether this goes here or whether it\u0027s got to go to review by service chaining and then come back and service chaining so give me a point of order always good to hear it but let me talk to Alvaro and that\u0027s just because I don\u0027t have Alvaro here he\u0027ll be here later today tomorrow excuse me on Tuesday so here and we will send me just to note that show I\u0027m sorry to ask that but John and I have dropped a few things so send me notes and yeah so to be clear what we are clarifying and this idea is just the bt pls extensions I presented both the drafts for the competition yes he just I just need to work with el farol sure to find out does it sit in service training and then they request that we add the BGP just let me work with Alvaro care we send me your drafts again yes I\u0027ll make sure thank you thank you folks okay we try to do this as we talked about "
