    "text": "identity network identities and resolving them is actually easy you deal with a lot of identities at a device level and at an application level every state that you use in your application has an identity right and one of the questions is who controls that identity who owns that identity so there is a huge trade off between what do you want as consistency properties and what do you want as likeness properties how do you handle mobility off identity how do you handle mobility of state across edge nodes and you know cloud nodes and when you have distributed applications operating over the same state how do you make sure that they are actually operating in a consistent manner so there are specific trade-offs as specified in the cap theorem between consistency availability and partition I will not get into details here but I am just saying that we build the identity space management solution to handle this next slide now we also supported a whole set of file system primitives around get and put I\u0027m calling pootis or post and also such as a way of essentially building applications in a very simple manner as if it looks like a file system so we built a whole suite of applications on top of a simple primitive setup where we had just basically primitives on getting data putting data and searching for data based on the identity space if people are familiar with distributed hash tables this is basically a similar building but it\u0027s really extending that concept to an SP an environment in that low bandwidth and hi Dennis next like so like about 30 seconds thank you so they built a huge spectrum of applications we build an application where people can buy and sell goods across different cell towers we built an application that people could sense agricultural farms and collect the data in a distributed fashion you could send voice message the voice message could store get stored at the local base station then get synchronized with the cloud then get sent from the cloud to another base station where the receiver is and the receiver can check voice messages similarly we can do a distributed messaging next like we can support web caching full-fledged web caching and we can actually show that you can control the cache and next slide final slide is we recently use this to build a fish line in Nicaragua and people are buying and selling fish using this platform with that I will stop and take questions Thanks thank you very much likes me that was fabulous and I appreciate both your instar Bonnie I\u0027m taking time too and waiting anyone have any questions for Lakshmi a note that if you\u0027re on the guy "
