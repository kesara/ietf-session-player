If anybody has ever tried using client search, even server search with web service, anything else. it is hard to do this sensibly. You get certificates issued in all kind of random formats from corporate Pikaya Pikaya Infrastructure. And users cannot work out how to take the file or whatever they've been given, the security token they've been given and make it work with an application. And this means that users don't use security tokens. They don't use a TPM despite them having been ubiquitous for Is it can I say decades now? and they use files.

So next slide, please. Yeah. It's also system certificate stores. Most platforms, these bays will have their own secure relatively secure database for key storage. There is pkcs11 used for accessing crypto tokens, the TPM, of course. And then a plethora of different file formats, which can be either PEM text format or DR binary as well. So moving on, please. And then we get the pass phrase handling. EKCSLA 8 doesn't actually mandate the character set. So if you have non ASCII passwords, that may or may not work depending on the environment. And, yes, key storage keys are supposed to be local to her. a given machine generally where you don't share keys. That's not you what they're for. but even then differences between applications will will cause problems. Even PKCS12, which mandate essentiallyutf16 in a in a BMP spring. there are lots of different ways to get that wrong as well.

How do I use the key in my token? Well, it depends. which application, which crypto library, there are different ways there is a standard for this. RFC 7512 gives a URI for identifying PKS11 object a handful of applications use it, not very many. I've been fixing a whole bunch of them over the years. And then there's a question of whether you're actual provider library is installed and whether the system can automatically discover it or not. And there's tools for that on sort of unit select systems, the 11 kit, But lot of applications don't use the total providers, which are configured therein. Next slide. is TPM, I think, please. Same problem there. So there are 2 different open SSL engines for using keys, which are either within stored within TPM and DRAM. or wrapped by it. So you have a an encrypted person of the key in a in a pen file. Until I got them together and bash their heads, together a little bit. They were using different file format for storing their keys. differently generated hierarchy route keys. ephemeral keys for encrypting the files.

They sporadically supported and there aren't really standard methods of identifying the keys therein, right, there is There's a there was a certificate identify a draft a few years ago, which is linked from my last slide. but it didn't really go anywhere, and it's I'm not sure it's the right thing.

Right? as a whole bunch of different file types. A random subset of them will be supported by any given application. And, yes, if you have not the passwords, you you get a whole bunch of different pain from that as well. So Next slide, please. So this should just be easy. Right? Whatever I have, If I have a key and a token, I should just be able to use a RFC 7512, pkcs11 URI. In place of a file name, or other identifier, and it should just work.

I have literally 1000 of lines of code in OpenConnect, my pet VPN application, just to make this work. because it's really hard. So next slide, please. And that's basically the end. Right?

One of the things I was doing in 2008 was was working at Intel, and we evaluated the Cisco AnyConnect client for Linux. and we we found it wanting. Intel really wanted to be able to use search from a TPM at point, but it wouldn't even let us use a password on the certificate store at that point. So so we write to run.

And I'm not trying to modify anything about the cases of an self. the the draft does have recommendations for how to find a certificate certificates can often be found without looking into a token. the corresponding key you have to log in for. And so there's a recommendation about if you have a assert URI, which it's a bit of a misnomer, really, because it's not unique. It's just a set of search terms. you search all the available tokens, and if you find the certificate then log in to that token and then you'll find the key there. So there's some recommendations there about how you find the key certain the key given, like, given, like, given, like, given, like, RC 7512 URI, but that's not a modification of PK CSOF, and that's just how to use it.

And A certificate issued by a certain application that would give your corporations structure or script to whatever. However, it is given to you. may not work with any given application, and you may not know how to do it. there's a list I've just posted in the chat of, you know, various things that have gone wrong that over the years as examples. Right. I would like to suggest that this is an anti pattern, and rather than trying to fix that, one should not do it.

If you use 2 mail user agents, one of them has a key. wanna use the same key in the other one so you can decrypt the same messages on both clients.

You can't take a message signed with a hybrid signature and just take the, say, RSA part and See. Right? That's a valid RSA signature without it's being noticed. And the other the strong months of probability means that you can't even verify just the RSA without verifying the c. They're lithium. or vice versa.

And then that's a I think in the elephant, it's called w. then you have and you combine it with the message or a hash of the message and get something called c, and then you do yet another calculation that involves the private key and do something well in ECVSA. It's called s, and dilithium, I think it's called z. So the signature is the c and the z, and then you need the c to verify the z. what they do with the hybrid is that they don't send they don't give you see, instead they sign this here. Maybe they're exponentiating it with the RSA private key. and send you the RSA signature and the z. So then you have to in order you can't verify just the lithium because you don't have CECL. and calculate it. And if you only check the RSA, Yeah. You can get back to the c, but you don't know that that that that don't have any idea that the c is related in the way to the message. So it it could easily give you a forged signature. So that's the way they're they're all sorts of variations around this but but that's how non operability works. So next slide. So what does none strongness of our ability give us. it forces Verifiers to verify both signatures. You can't write an apparently good implementation that only verifies just the classic or just post quantum algorithm.

The Con is that we lose backward control capability. can't use your old hardware that does RSA or your old hardware that or while you're semi old. However, that does the lithium, to very side of these things because they're all mixed up. And as my consults mentioned it's it's probably some of those constructs are going to kill your FIP certification. because the the combination is not 5th's acceptable.

The lithium is not yet familiar. And the the signing over a new disrupt and a draft in 3 in section 31 2 is insecure because it doesn't check doesn't do the PH layer with a board thing where checks whether the the the the z actually leaks the private key.

So As I said, this appears to be the answer to the answer attempt to answer to the question How do you do high risk interest correctly? And my thesis is you should not do hybrid signatures at all.

As you have to be switch have to and and you have as you have to switch it in on the implementations, and it creates a whole additional bunch of complexity, and we already have the ability to switch it between post quantum and classical.

So so I I think this probably have the wrong question. I don't think Okay. Thanks, Amir. I can't say that I can't say that in my address, you say that I say that I'm not taking any position about whether hybrid signatures are a good thing or a bad thing. I'm not convinced they're a good thing, but and think that if they're if we want to do them, then should make the both signatures of mandatory. mandatory, not by assured in the draft, but by really making the algorithm enforce it. Steven? Hi. Steve, probably yeah. I I agree with Echo. I think I'm just not convinced that this hybrid signature thing is that useful. obviously, people are disagree and they're wanna do work on it. So I I think think the right dispatch thing is probably to sit back and relax for a couple of years.

The first thing that struck me, it sounded like that there were some this may be the wrong term, exploratory crypto that we wanna get some confidence in, And we would want CFRG to help us do that. It didn't seem like we could do that in lamps. then it seemed me reading a lot more in a draft that there are representational issues of how we would use that those new crypto criminals in terms of kind of formats And then there seems like there'll be, you know, the right practices for how would we would recommend to to do that. Is that the right way to read all the things that's getting put in this draft. I think there's not all that much. It's just about how you combine 2 centers. I mean, you they don't even really have to book be one of None of them have to be for quantum.

I wouldn't want to deal with another bit of crypto if I go into a different set of crypto algorithm, well, then I've got to I lose my certification of my signature my hardware security modules and so on. And, you know, it just strikes me at this point, what I want is hardware security modules that do dilithium as soon as possible. and and maybe something else. I don't want to put something else on the table people to wait for to implement that before they start working on it, you know, it it it just doesn't seem to be Mhmm. useful, and I think that it could get in the way of other stuff So I I I'm with Steve fireless. just wait on it for 2 years or whatever. Just for clarification, thing you want us to wait on forever is hybrid signatures, not necessarily hybrid signatures with strong unsuperability. Okay. So we are running out of time here, and we don't want to cut into the other drafts. we have one more in Kia. Okay? Theater. what what what Thank you. I'll I'll be quick. Peter Campbell, UKNCSE.

So signatures will leak information about private key. integrating rejection sampling is not straightforward. You need to redo not just the diluting step you have to redo the ECDSA steps. So it it's not a is not a straightforward solution. So I think if if it is something that people want to see, it needs to go to CFRG for that analysis. Okay, thank you. The consensus seems to be starting in CFRG for advice, and then when ready, dispatched to lamps. So what Lantus Prudence you said is they are willing to continue kinda talking about what these kind of classes of signatures are. gonna start. And what we heard was or at least what I heard, was that there was kind of questions about kind of the approach I think we're only gonna get the get these answers from CFRG. depending on kinda where we are and depending where the parallel thread that's continuing kind of a Lance how that goes, there may be an intersection there. So so, Roman, I I was sitting here listening to the discussion, and I heard overwhelmingly, no. We don't need this. and that's I mean, on just an observer, but but that's what I was hearing here rather than, you know, sit on it or wait or anything else. I mean,"

So we're I'm not denying that there was pushback certainly strong pushback about whether or wanna do that. But if the authors want a next step, can go to CFRG to answer kind of some of these unknown kind of questions. about the security properties relative to that, and I wanna reiterate what the lampshares, we're kind of saying, is that there's an in flight activity to kind of explore that. Again, not saying we're there being an wholesale kind of adoption to that. But depending on how that conversation would would go, there be an opportunity to re inject that into the conversation. And that yeah. That's why I said when ready, which may be never. I can I quickly comment on this? Okay. Go ahead, Chris. But after that, we're done here. Sorry. Thanks. Chris Wood. While it seems reasonable to take this to CFRG, That group is already overloaded with a tremendous number of documents. And if it's not work that is actively wanted or needed on the IETF I think it would be harmful to that group to bring it there. So I I've I I I think we should 1st establish if this is something we need and then And only then should we bring it to the CFRG to work on it? Okay. Please please talk with the CFRG chairs before you send it there. Yeah. I mean, the dispatch result will include that that was the vibe about the needed kind of utility.

But this is probably the most important one. I think sec dispatch is the right place. Next. So the the starting point here is that site to site IPSec Usually, we say, like, site to site IP sec tunnels, but IP spec doesn't only do tunnels. is is pretty great. it defeats IP spoofing, because if you got an IP address that was supposed to come through the tunnel and comes outside the tunnel instead, then you can just drop it. At least maybe you can just drop it. It's good for security. It's tamper resistant. It's good for privacy. If you decide to turn on encryption, which is well supported. It's very well understood. It's very fast. Anybody any pair of networks can use it. Right? There's no particular need for me to be, like, your GPU or whatever. Any any pair of networks who want to set up a site to IP Sact tunnel can do so. Let's see how that works. Next slide. So here's the protocol for setting up a site to site IP SAC tunnel. You send an email and you say, I'd like to set up an IPSec tunnel with you. and, like, here's we're gonna do IP 2, and here's my gateway. And there's some that you're, like, network administrator on the other side, says, like, okay, that sounds great, and and we're only gonna send traffic through that, and here's my client certificate or something like that. So this works. This is not considered a violation of the end to end principle. Right? Like, packets are still flowing end to end. There's a tunnel in the middle that's Okay. So that protocol exists. Next slide. but it isn't very widely used. And my thesis about why it's not very widely used is that it's it doesn't scale very well. So What if we automated that process? if we said We we took that exchange that Alison Bob had and we turned it into a machine readable config file"

And so, you know, within 24 hours, everybody in the world will know your config, which would include things like the IP address of your IP 2 gateway. and our PKI provides a root of trust in an identity system, a PKI, that allows you to securely negotiate, authenticate the the hike v Two handshakes. it provides the information about which IP ranges are allowed for each participant, so I know if I'm getting an advertisement from from another party, whether it's allowed or not, And the result is that with if if n parties in the network, each produce one of these configs and turn on a gateway of this kind we could get N Squared IPsec associations as they all talk to each other. and protect all of their inter AS traffic through the network. That's the heart of this proposal. That's the idea here. Everything else is really details and very much subject to change. It's the rest of it is really about, okay. If we really tried to do this, what difficulties would we run into in terms of scaling IPSec to a very large number of networks, very complicated networks. networks with very high reliability requirements in terms of turning things on and off and running running AB tests and and all that kind of good stuff. So and to sec dispatch, I think the the real question here is you know, does this sound intriguing to you? Would you like to live in a world where somebody who taps the backbone doesn't see client IP addresses. they only see effectively information that amounts to this AS is sending a packet to this other AS. all the other information, is encrypted."

Again, there's a there's a an Internet registry with produces these things and then maybe local registries. You've got your 2 ASs that then do an IQ 2 exchange between what we call the control servers, and then all of their border routers would be configured to to to run IPSec in some potentially pretty complicated configuration, but within the IP secs specifications. And if the current IP spec specifications aren't quite up to snuff, then we can maybe, you know, define some extensions as needed. Next slide. This is some details of the current proposals. We've defined a transport mode and a tunnel mode? In principle, we only need one mode but we define both of them because it seems like they both can work In particular, there's been a lot of discussion about whether the transport mode with authentication header, is viable or whether people hate the authentication header too much cannot be it's, like, radioactive I don't know. It doesn't seem that bad to me. But So there's there's trade offs here in terms of, like, overhead and and performance, but that is all really details, and I'm sure we'll change if this goes anywhere. slide. So Risav really treats the Internet as a network of networks Right? Because the inter network communications in this model changes. It is not the same as the end to end communications.

So do you wanna like, is there an So I I think I that's the last slide. Okay. So let's stop them. Okay. Stephen. Stephen, So so just just a question. So I I remember, like, many years ago, Savi was a a thing that was proposed, and it had a bunch of downsides, which I in terms of traceability and censorship and so on. Is there How is it not the case that some of those apply here also? I I can't speak to savvy specifically, but most source address validation, proposals thus far have been are called control plane proposals. So they they essentially talk about how networks negotiate relationships with each other, This is a data plane proposal, meaning that this is essentially a a TLS style Mac and encryption, potentially that applies to each packet. And so it adds overhead. both computational and and bandwidth because it expands those packets. So so I guess in the terms of dispatch, I'd kinda like to not understand the that kind of those kind of questions before figuring out how I would dispatch. Okay? John, Hey, John Scudder, Juniper Networks. So I I'm I'm not a network operator. but it strikes me that the difference so first of all, I think that, you know, your your solution for the introduction problem Yeah. That's what the RPI does well. I agree. I'm concerned about deploying this thing at scale between ASs. sort of you you you let in with, like, IP stack between sites is awesome. I agree."

So the the volume of traffic that's gonna be passing between these people is orders of magnitude greater than than the previously solved problem. And then the second observation is the people who are gonna have this treatment applied to their traffic are essentially not opting in which would also concern me. I apologize for not directly answering the how do we dispatch this question, but there are some concerns here. On the second point, I would say, you know, this preserves the end to end property. I believe I I Yeah. feel, in my view, it's it's, like, compliant with all the IPR FCs in that sense. 10th. Tetherty, occasional nanog reader. I I think if you went back to the email version of this, it would be bit cleaner. I I really appreciate the the fact that you're pointing out Exactly where this particular form of of encryption is added and removed because that's it's it's always nice to have clarity around that. -- little slide. You know? But I think one of the interesting things here is you have corp 1 and corp2.example, and those very likely aren't LARs. those are probably customers of LARs. And so you have the typical raralar customer thing. And I think there's an operational piece to this where this would require some coordination between the customer and the LAR either to add a new part So This would only be for use by to the RPKI or to give them an AS. is -- Well -- -- is -- Well, but I'm not sure that's the problem that actually wants solving. Right? It's not the same problem Alice and Bob are solving. in particular, because Alice and Bob are solving customer to customer and you're replacing that by something that's LAR to LAR."

Maybe that's as as it pointed out, that's not necessarily the the the sort of solve problem status quo for IP SECT tunnels. That's another order of magnitude or 2 or 2 or up. Oh, okay. So I I will point out that you you kinda don't say that in your in your in your slides. And If you're gonna say only customers large enough to also be ISB Ps could use this. That's a very different problem space and a very different set potential users. And I I will point out if you try and use this Outside of that, then you have multiple customers who passed through the LAR to LAR tunnel as ISP to ISP, and that's not something that they can detect is going on. They don't know it's happening in the same way that their operations staff of a customer of corp 1 to corp 2 knows when Alison Bob have set it So it it's it's something where I feel like you you haven't got the the the use case actually kind of written out quite right. And I would suggest dispatching it. I I would get to the question to to one or two places. Go and talk to Nanook Ripe or or some of the folks which actually contain a lot of LARs and see what they they think about it. And it it might actually be worth talking to the Aaron policy list. because there's a huge number of people on that list that think pretty deeply about how RPKI can app used Thanks, Ted.

So what I would want to see is to come back with a clearer use case of when we would benefit from this and how we would address some of the operational concerns that come out of that because, like, the immediate thing I saw when you see this gateway thing is, like, cool. We just lost all of our entropy on our 5 tools.

Okay. Thanks, Alex. David. David, it's Kenazi. IP second enthusiast. For real, though. So routing security is not something I know much about. But the one thing I know about it is that, apparently, it's really part, part of the reasons for that is And life, key management is hard, and also routing tables are really big. This sounds like your in a way, kinda combining both of those difficult problems and, you know, having o to the n squared, right, you say. Like, My intuition is probably completely off, but I'd you know, I think some things would melt here. So I would second what Ted said, which is talk of the actual operators. and get a feel for oh, yeah. We absolutely need need this. Let's do this. Or Our brain just melted, and our routers then did too. And once we -- Yeah. This would melt all the routers. Absolutely. You have to double the number of routers in the world. like, I'm fine with that because I've Okay. Okay. Okay.
