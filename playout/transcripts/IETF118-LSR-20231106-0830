That was just updating all the on ejectional language, the master slave terminology, and all the OSPF graphs. And a couple of places where And I don't understand this one. Where we eliminated black hole as a sync. For traffic that gets dropped. And used a term of unreachable, We have these 2 these 2, biz documents that we did.

So there is no significant change here. What we change is the way that we advertise the new flags that had been defined advertising gun reachability. So in the previous version of the draft, be used different mechanism for SPV 2 and different mechanism for SPV 3 for V3 we even edit a new TLV. But when we looked and, there was an existing draft, which defines subtleV for advertising additional flag for both V2 and V3, so we decided to use that instead of you know, using different mechanisms in the in in the different versions of the protocol. Next slide, please. So what we did, we took that existing, subtlb, which has been defined. SPV 2, it is part of the, it's a subtile of the extended prefix GLOB. In this It's, a subtile.

To all code points where it's necessary to do so. There are implementations and I think the The big issue that we've been discussing has to do with partial deployment. Let's go to the next slide So just updates in V4 of the draft We put in some clarification that multi part can apply to any that includes both top level TLVs and sub TLVs that themselves have a a nested level of sub DLVs. We added back a capability advertised it. That indicates that an implementation has, support for multipark TLVs where the original RFC did not have an explicit vacation of that. We'll discuss this a little more shortly. And we've introduced a companion draft to advertise, what at least in ISO speak has been called protocol implementation conformance statements.

But AC, I really think that your comment would be more appropriate after Kingson's presentation, So so hold that thought. So we've introduced a a companion draft. It's one of the concerns that's been raised is how does the operator know what is supported. By the the various routers in their network. And how do they so, therefore, how do they know whether it's safe to enable a particular feature? Or not. In Yingsen's presentation, should go through what we've, defined as as a model for doing this. But I think there's two key points I want to add for emphasize here, that, The amount of information that you need to send to fully describe what's a and implementation supports is far more than just a bullion that says I support this feature. I don't don't support this feature. And that'll become clear, I think, in Ying's presentation. So This easily explodes into a large amount of data. If you want to fully describe what an implementation supports, And sending this to the routing protocol is a very inappropriate choice because it means not only are you consuming a lot of space in in the protocol advertisements. But you're storing this on every node. The airfersion is really only of use from a network management point of view."

The draft is already just about two years old. The deployment needs that that drove the creation of the draft that existed for even longer than that. There's been a lot of discussion, on and off the list about we not do this in a backwards compatible way? The answer to that is no. There is no way to do this in a backwards compatible way. There's been some suggestion. Isn't this similar to when we went from narrow metrics to wide metrics. It is not similar. We're not introducing any new code points. We don't have a legacy way to advertise more than 255 bytes. In in the narrow wide case, we had a legacy way to advertise metric. So the there was a transition path there This is not available here.

So, you know, to be fair, With that definition, we most solution is backward compatible because it doesn't create routing loops.

Backwards compatible means that I can flip the staff on the operational network and the staff, the network will stay up, and I can flip it around to my router. Okay? Because the factor today, we already have all these wild implementation. If we start to introduce a new TLDs, flip up, you know, just one route. The other artists don't understand Yeah. That may cause problems, but so so will the other solution. Okay? Because if you introduce complete new information, people don't parse it. Yeah. You end up with routing loops. Why I'm a try to do is basically Antonio hates with all saying that you have to forklift the protocol. Okay? Because what will I do? Now I will advertise the new information format, all the information format until I migrate over. No. Yeah. Well, so That sounds. That sounds. So once this thing starts to talk this new format, that one was suggesting he's not as is. It's just talk something nobody else in the network understands. Yes.

You know, this would be really good to have, you know, have this information on any. I think we have to be careful on the level of granularity. I looked at the our MPLS.

I'm not gonna say, but you know, I'm wondering, are we actually gonna do this for every every every every every RFC and what about the existing RFCs? It's just gonna be a lot of work, and we're only doing it for ISIS. So If ISI adapts this at least us as the LSR working group, we should do it for SPF as well, o and OSB 3.

So, I show you what the problem is, what the suggested solution framework is, looks like this is not a cooked solution, we should do. This is a taxonomy so we can talk reasonably about the space Okay? And then we see what falls out of that. Next one. Alright. So what's the problem, statement. What are we addressing?

And do you, I mean, kind of hope as you can imagine, you know, where that's coming from, right? Your power lane to 1 and to 1. So one possibility to figure out, you know, how is a part of your network is to introduce a monitoring infrastructure and whatever that is, you know, some models analytics, whatever. The problem with this kind of stuff is that the transport of such infrastructure and all the, you know, involve complexities itself, basically prone to attacks. Obsticated the text. So basically, the text vector gets even wider. And if you lose the monitoring infra the semantics are unclear. It's not clear what it means. Right? Did the in forget attack? Is the router gone? It just a bullet? Alright. And you just start to take networks down because the connection is down. You can basically Get yourself basically down, downhill slow. So after chats with different parties, suggestion is to actually start in the IGP database to advertise the security properties of the network. And, yeah, it will lead to a lot of further discussion, what that means. And why is it because there's no additional monitoring in front? It's the fastest thing. The network.

And, when you look at the security folks, what I like is to have a model which is most widely used Not that I'm a bit of a security expert, expert, but they use a relative simple model, how you basically define how secure something is. And you talk about the CIA model. It's basically a confidentiality. Right? So it's the information confidential. So somebody cannot snoop it. Is do you have integrity, which means you cannot be corrupted or also reply Right? There's subtleties there. And do you have availability? Which is very counterintuitive. Right? So, actually, preventing you from having something means something is insecure. Bye. And DDoS by now being something that drop people. No. You understand what I'm bot where you can suppress the service. Okay. So, need some kind of language that starts to hold up to further talking about complexity. Let's call this thing security characteristics. Okay? They are not comparable. So if something is confidential, doesn't mean that it is it used to guarantee integrity. And because something is says integrity, it doesn't mean it's more secure than confidentiality. Those are kind of, no, it's a three-dimensional vector space, which is kind of a total. Alright. So Some technologies offer, of course, a mix, and there 22 or, you know, whatever, and the technology of different strengths. That's that's a not not work I'll be using now. And it's kind of intuitive. Right? If you have, encryption and you have different key lengths that has different strength. Right? But a certain Shah is weaker than another Shah.

The security characteristic confidentiality, now has, you know, a couple of properties. Like, I'm running this algorithm, and I'm also supporting this thing, and that always gives me confidentiality. Alright? And these properties have strengths. So now think like that. So characteristic is the CIA. The property is kind of an algorithmic, and the strength is what key length to our use. Alright? Now, the security properties are comparable to each other. Right? So I can compare key hundred to a shot too with the 200 bits key. So you can start to carry vectors of a security characteristic. Which are security properties. Right? So example here, he buy, have integrity, I can basically say, okay, I'm running a 50 IP sec and the 10 shot too. And a check sum. And the 50105. Are basically the strength of the property. You know that the IP stack is much more secure. Then there's a 2 or the checks up. Alright? And for confidentiality, and you see here becomes the technology sometimes overlap. So the IP sector will also give you confidentiality. Right? So you also carry the antigen shellity vector. And forget the null, basically, you have to be able now to compare those vectors. Two links show you. Okay. I have this kind of security properties, and then I have 6 security properties.

Because this framework also allows us to introduce completely new properties without lifting, you know, the protocol version of the software. Alright. So there's a last missing piece. Where you have to say what you do with the thing is you actually don't have it implemented. Right? So here shows up at security property and you go like, Okay. I don't really know what it is, right, and it's worse when it's missing. While you have the strength. So, you you flat. That's the 2nd bullet point.

It has a certain string, string, it's stronger than the other thing or less stronger than the other thing. And you have the attribute value because if it's a encryption algorithm, you need the key length. And you compare the attribute value. So you go, okay. This guy runs short. Shawan. He's got a Shawan. He is a longer key. He's a better guy. Alright? Now the flags are necessary because If you don't know what this char 2 thing is, you still want to kind of compare it. Right? So if you have the attribute value key length, you actually don't know whether better is worse, higher values better or worse value, smaller values bet better. If you'd carry, for example, availability, link loss, Well, if you lose more, it's a worse thing. Right? If you if you look at the encryption algorithm, a longer key, is actually better.

We've gotta wrap up Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's about it. So here's the inevitable encoding, which is, of course, not not very interesting. We need 3 or pegs for each characteristic.

Like, I want my path to do something. Like, don't use a path that is not confidential. Whatever. You can discover compromise routers, right? And Here come interesting ideas. So You can Look for something like availability. Right? The guy started to lose adjacency. So all of a sudden, it doesn't have many adjacencies. So, like, what does it mean? A availability is going down. Is that something you're concerned about? Does this thing become less secure? Will you decommission it? Is does it raise an alarm? And AC had also a interesting observation. You can look at degradation of things, right, where the attack may be very sophisticated. Or maybe you just installed a bad software version that has problems And that degrades availability.

So, the solution is to not bring up adjacency with C until The latest LSA from C has been received and, has been updated on the, on B and E, which are adjacent to see. So, so the change from previous version is that We in previous version, we were trying to use LS requests list, but I problems which was pointed out in the mailing list And we updated the solution with this modification wherein We call this we we built a new LSA list. This called the stale essay list. So this is internal to the note. It doesn't get advertised or doesn't get communicated to its neighbors. So when, a neighbor when an urgency comes up and an old receives and LSA from its neighbor wherein the neighbor is the originator of that LSA. And the that LSA, you know, the, note that received the LSA from the origin the has this higher sequence number and and thus has a, you know, it evaluates it to be the newest it knows that the originator itself is sending a lower sequence number.

So y is Why sequence number y is greater, So he assumes that it is generally as per standard OSP procedures. It assumes y as the No latest LSA, but here, the modified procedure is that it marks that LSA as stale. And then I asked it to stay on a list. So until, he receives a LSA, which has a sequence number higher than y, it doesn't bring that decency. Make that decency full with sea. So if you see the procedure here, then see, we'll send an LSA request for y and then he will flood the, and let's say sequence number y.

And, sir, there's the extended subtelvis of e ECS and the last day is a future plan. So firstly is the motivation and the problem statement. As we all know that the link loss is one of the most in important performance metric that directly impacts the quality of service. It is necessary to avoid passing through links with a high packet loss rate during forward So to achieve this goal, by using classic flexible algorithm, there are 2 problems. First, is how we can identify the link with a high high packet loss. And second is how to use the flexible algorithm to do the pass computation. Unfortunately, it's the first one is is solved. The link loss is advertised by the unit to know link loss up to be defining RFC 8 5 70, 46, and also, it's it's easy advertising which describes the loss as a packet percentage between 2 directly connecting neighbors. At now the flexible algorithm currently cannot support past computation based on link loss. Since link class cannot be described as general addable metrics like cost. But that, I mean, the general aggregate cost can be added to 1 one to another. And for example, the a to c cost can be described as a to b 9, plus B2C. However, the"

That is the link the links whose loss rate exists as a specific specified value are excluded And second, the metric pack metric type just remains unchanged. We can we still use the IDB cost, T cost, or delay to do the pest competition. Our goal is to prove a with a high packet loss rate during past competition. For example, in the figure below, from we need to find a a shortest path from, node 1 to node 4 in the beginning, the pass is chosen as the link 1 to 4. Since it has the it has a minimal cost. However, the loss of it is is extremely large. So the we will obtain a bad, cocktail service.

E2C1 is, IGP car route in on the lane. That provides intent or will pass to E2. It is originally advertised by E2. And then we distributed by ABR notes across different IGP domains. PGP service route is resolved over IGP car route and, automatically, staled onto a color where I pass it can still for L3 VPN, EVPN Global Table as so on. This slide is about SR policy based IGP car. In this case, as our policy provides intent in each domain. It to advertise this, IGP car route in the main three for prefixe2.

Also control play, the main difference with the previous s r policy case is that on each ABRs, the card label is resolved over flex ergo offset domain. Using the prefix seed of, advertiser of the car out on data plane, the packet is forwarded along the path computed by Flex Air Go 128. The top label is perfect seed of the border device. This is a hybrid case in domain 1 and the 3, the the intent of color c 1 is provided by s r policy. Well, in domain too, color c 1 is mapped to flexible 128.
