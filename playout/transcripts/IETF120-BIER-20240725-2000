So that's only 35 minutes 50 including me So all right, we got another chapter. Perfect charter and milestones. If you look at our milestones list right now, it's rapid updated. There's no milestones actually on it from a temporal perspective They're all accomplishments. They're all old dates And additionally, we didn't have a lot of structure around the milestones at that time Each working group kind of did their own thing. And it was actually a list that I've sent to the AD. And then we sent it up and it got published. Now there's tools around it that we can edit and most of it's just me clicking buttons. Anything new the AD has to approve. We ban- on a little bit. You might have seen the email when I deleted an item Apparently email sends out every time there's a change, but if I'm, if I set my, uh, uh, correctly, I can change them all at one time and minimize them amount of email, but that's just a warning. So and the charter is just some minor updates updates So the recommendation in talking to Gunter is like, you know, these aren't milestones anymore. They're all accomplishments We're going to delete the whole list and we're going to start with something new And for archiving our accomplishments, we can put them in the archive. And what was suggested is itemize a list of accomplishments, maybe, you know, two or three of those blocks to say how we've gotten to where we are and then add all the open draft to there.

It's usually a side job from our, our full-time employee and you can't tell anyone else how to manage their time.

So if there's things we need to be doing at least chartered things we should be looking for, and they're not open drafts already for them, it's appropriately sustained things we need to be doing, at least chartered things we should be looking for, and they're not open drafts already for them, it's appropriately tom strickx it in the milestones. Yeah, this is a part of our charter expectation. We'll put it in the milestone And once we have a draft actually attacking that work, then we can make that update at the time Charter, if you read the first paragraph, our most recent charter, which has been revved a couple of times it itemizes our encapsulation accomplished architecture accomplishments, kind of original objectives that came from the Boff and the instantiation of the working group to begin with. Some things have been added since then I haven't been added into the charter itself. We have an ether type assignment, which is fantastic. And actually, that brings up a really good point because I think it's the I triple E record doesn't have the RFC number listed They have the old draft. And there's some expectation from the IETF to make that request. And I couldn't do it because I didn't make the request for the for the NCAP or the ether type so there's actually a thread where I was working with Lovaro. I pointed out to him, made the request you know, he was gonna fire it up the tree and then Alvaro walked away and now it's still there so it's just a housekeeping bit Yeah, I'll hear the original thing with me, right? Alia submitted it and then, and we got it back and then Leah stepped down and Alvara came in and that's when I saw I Tripoli hadn't made the change. And that fell into his hand The other thing is, I think should be as added to the draft is we have an objective of finding a V6 and encapsulation solution. We've done it. We've already adopted the draft"

Oh, is it really? Wow, yeah, then nothing they can do about it then. All right Yeah, crazy All right, so... Construction workers, tell them there's free beer in the bar or just come out there with beer i'll sit down it'll be done Right, that will be it. So one thing that's come up is some solutions around a large fan out some potential increasing replication and coding efficiencies, maybe you know, a rev and beer. These things have come along and I think it's a safe charter objective to say that we know, a rev and beer. These things have come along, and I think it's a safe charter objective to say that we're open and looking for ways to continue to improve efficiency and scalability of beer. So that's obvious one. Other thing that's come out, probably gosh, in full force back in Prague and there's a lot of churn in Brisbane about it as well, is all this work taking place specifically for network requirements for AI-like data centers And if there's a multi-point requirement that index replication makes sense, I think it makes sense to have that in our charter as well. So again, we don't have an active draft, but it's something to say, we are here. You have, want to work with people who work in replication space. We can help.

So the simple example below is that we have um whatever, you know, four sets on the whole space and we have two receivers. And if you look what are the all possible combine per permutations actually a where two receivers may end up in so both may be in the first set or one two one three one four right you have about ten permutations and when you look at when you hit ingress replications you hit it when you have one, two, one, three, one, four, two, three, two, four, and so six times which means you have a 60 percent chance with four sets and two receivers to actually end up being ingress replication and if you look at 16 receivers, which is roughly what people talk about, and we talk about 65K BF 16 receivers, which is roughly what people talk about, and we talk about 65K BFRID space at 256 beat mask and you do some permutation math you end up roughly with 0.4 so it's 40% chance of English replication.

So when you replicate, you can actually, you know, modify this what I call unmasked beer or U beer beat mask you can modify it you know easily and the BFR IDs are not sorted because no this know, this leads immediately to silicon problems And the signaling is really simple we basically stick one more label binding, but this time, of course, there is no set binding right so this is basically one label for an MTSD, BML and carried around So fairly simple stuff, right?

Everything will just work Next slide, please. The next one is spelled out in sections 6.9 of our architecture spec basically at the end of the SPF calculation we will try to figure out which of the children of the routes do not support here. We go through every of those children and then we replace a child that is not beer capable with its children and basically re-parent its children to the roots so now um, a beer incapable child of the roots is removed from the SPF tree replaced by its children and replaced it to the route directly Eventually, all the children of the roots on the SPF tree are beer capable.

And that may not be desired in certain situations. For example, there could be a long-haul transition link between fbf r1 and x we would like to avoid those multiple copies there Tethering can avoid that It's depicted in the lower right corner basically we attach, say, a small beer router next to that router that cannot do beer There is, because they are next to each other you can have a local fat pipe between them And then the BFR one, we're only tunnel one coffee to that tethered router bfr x and that router would then send individual copies to BFR3"

So this is a summary of the Bronfiel deployment options. Naked multi-tops section 6.9 of the architecture documents, and its BGP equation and skip the non- in the beer routing table and beer folding table calculation and you can use controllers to program those forwarding tables into beer tethering and finally you can do php so that your BFERs do not need to handle beer forward they only need to do the beer control plan As far as I see it, the most practical solutions will be the Section 6 to handle beer forwarding. They only need to do the beer control plan. As far as I see it, the most practical solutions will be the section 6.9 of the RFC 82-7 and the tethering and penultimate popping the other solutions where we skipped a non non-bFRs or using the native naked empty that can be done It's just you need to make sure that you have complete a graph of the beer routers Especially you may need to have used tunnels that can be viewed as the IGP adjacencies and that part introduced some operational complexity"

    "text": "on the next slide please so basically all these options have their corresponding specifications is the purpose of this draft is just basically informational drafts to list all these options for the opportunity and vendors to consider these options and what's the best option to for them to deploy to development So we'd like to invite discussions comments, and eventually maybe a working group adoption as an informational draft Got one question Oops. I think there were a couple of more drafts too, right? For Brownfield, wasn't there like a PIM signaling? over beer, MLDP? over beer, IGMP, all this is stuff? for the, for the brown, like I think those become very useful for the vendors to a stitch multiple PIM domains or MLDB domains and stuff like that Okay, so I think you're talking about how to do multicast forwarding end-to-end where part of it uses PIM and part of it is beer or something like that. Is that correct? Yes so I think when we started multiple vendors, they were giving us feedback that you know, they do like beer. Like, let's say like, in a 5G network or IPTV, right? where you have these legacy routers at the end that are doing PIM or IGMP or even just MLDP and they were saying that, well, you know, I want to go in a clean core that, you know, IGP on underlay, BGP overlay, right?"

    "text": "And I want to deploy beer in my clean core So how do I stitch my PIM? So that's where we came up with the PIMC signaling over beer, MLDP, C signaling over beer, which I think I need to ask for a last call on that one, actually. So we came up with three draft that were grabbing this legacy multicam of stuff and kind of signaling it over beer to the other end, right? So I think for Brownfield those would be obviously useful, right? Okay I see your points Indeed, when this strap was written we were more focusing on that in the beer domain itself. What if you have the routers cannot support beer Your point is that end-to-end multi-casts where you can have a PIM or some other forwarding in some part of the network, and then you can have beer forwarding in some part of network. Yeah I think that's a valid point. It is indeed a valid point. It's just that it was not in the considered in this draft initially. We can either include that in this draft or we can do another draft in the N-Bong-D it was not in the consider in this draft initially we can we can either include that in this draft or we can do another draft in the n bong d i'm i'm open to anything Well, I mean, my two senses, if you have a draft that you want to give to a provider just to do deploy beer anywhere in their network, one single draft would be ideal, right? Sure. Agreed. Question, Human the the problem went that ended up at the end was that if you had multiple ingress in a beer domain, right? We needed the election of the replication point You remember because of the redundancy? So did that make progress? I think that went to PIM to be worked on Yeah, so in PIM we did PIM light Sorry, what was the chair? What was the director name? I forgot his name. I'm horrible at names. Not before"

No, no, this guy's good. He's good Two directors before So, Gontor, there was another gentleman the one before that. Anyway Yes, yes. So he was saying that if you are doing a this funky thing with PIM go to PIM and come up with PIM light So PIM light is becoming RFC anyway I think that's like that that's done So what I'm going to do is now I'm going to grab the PIM light bring it into the PIM signaling over beer into that wrap So finish that draft with PIM light in there But then there was the MLDP signaling that I think you know, ICE, Jeffrey, everybody was on at two Again, same idea. If you have two MLDP islands, Iceland, and you want to connect it to a beer core, and then I think a stick put another draft for IGMP, being a stitch over beer, right? So all this stuff are brownfield to me, which I would imagine having it in a single draft it's a it's a it's a it's to cover that that's basically flow overlay part. It's good, it's good idea in a single draft. It's a good idea to cover that. That is basically flow overlay part. It's good idea that we have that covered as well It's just at this moment, this draft is indeed only for the other underlay Yeah. Okay, so just in sure, do we have agreement that we're going to cover it in here? or do we want a different draft? I'm fine with coming here. Okay, let's cover it here. All right, cool But, Human, my question was, there was one piece missing If you had, let's say, the same piece domain hooked up to a beer domain at two points, right? We need an election algorithm for the replication Which one?"

    "text": "And was that work ever finished? Because it kind of wandered out of beer because it was like generic for a lot of protocols no the election work was done the election and stuff everybody agreed on in the working group The only part that the director didn't agree on is the fact that we were trying to come up with a PIM specific protocol that didn't have hello you know didn't have PIM hello, because we said there is no PIM hello And he said that, well, that sense this PIM doesn't have hello, it's a beast of its own. So go work in the PIM working group to to come up with the new protocol, which we call it PIM light And now that that's becoming RFC, I'm just going to grab and push this into this other draft on the pier side. And then the work is done. The work was done Ah, okay. So we basically have this PIM unicorn dancing by the stream, but we'll have a generic solution for everything else he just wanted me to do more because that's the missing piece Okay, and then, yeah, I mean, you gentlemen, discuss. One draft sounds good, on the other hand, it'd be becomes you know huge kitchen sing i know i'm not, I'm okay with that. I can assert on another draft. But I would imagine, you know, if you want to I would join this draft too and just put it into this draft so we have one draft for everybody. Yeah we can work on the content. Okay, thanks. Right. I mean, if an R know, if you want to, I would join this draft too and just put it into this draft so we have one draft for everybody. Yeah, we can work on the content. Okay, thanks. Right. I mean, if an RFP goes out, I tend to agree, right? The less RFCs they have to stitch together to actually get the hats around the better Sure. One more points about the elections so that we don't send traffic, redundant traffic into the beer That is actually okay When you do have two entry points into the beer domain the BFER, one particular BFER, should only be one on one, should only be receiving traffic from one of the entry point anyway. So it may not be that efficient but there should be no problem of duplicate traffic around"

First, R2 perceives the route to R3 is unreachable Before the root convergence, FRRP, paid effect. So if be FRR is enabled on R2, R2 was then packed to the backup neighbor assists The IGP publish the link from event within the domain Each node recalculates the route After that, they updated Faber and the bill forwarding table from this moment the old FR backup path is no longer effective. After our tools completed the route convergence, the BFR enabled from R2 to ANA is modified to R6 assist.

So in Unica's case, you can calculate the path and back parts to individual preference for example, individual loopbacks In the beer case, you do the same thing You calculate the path to individuals BFER, beer prefixes. And so you use basically the same way to same PQ concept and then TILFA tunnels to make sure your backup paths to a particular BFEA does not cause loops And then after those individual calculations, then you just put them into your fifth and then you calculate FBN and so that you can do the beer folding magic.
