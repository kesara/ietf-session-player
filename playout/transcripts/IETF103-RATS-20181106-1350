Zeus that way but the point was that we we believed that we needed to transport it across the internet and that beyond saying this is a voucher we had no business or care what was going to go in it and that was great and then suddenly we had this realization I guess about two years ago that we actually wanted to audit the contents of it and that it mattered to the intermediaries that it was flowing through that they could actually look at it and even verify the signature on the process because that there was an audit requirement not that they needed to produce it or really consume it but that there was a problem in the middle and so suddenly we discovered we needed a standard format and I think that that we are essentially that\u0027s the difference between the multitude of proprietary verticals that have done attestation and what we\u0027re trying to do is that we recognized that we have this we have we have other "
