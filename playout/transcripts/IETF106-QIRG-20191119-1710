    "text": "changes so first in the updated section we illustrate now the challenges to do with what what\u0027s the main challenge of in a quantum network and essentially in a quantum network with there some major challenges are the fact such as the measurement problem in a classical network you can look at your packet you can actually read the headers and you can relive in the user data if you so wish and you can\u0027t do that in a quantum network when you do you destroy your data and your entire state so you cannot do that which kind of already already in that it makes copying difficult and why what makes copying really difficult is the no-cloning theorem you cannot actually copy anything in the quantum world copying is basically how you do networking and you can\u0027t do that in classical and quantum networking at all it\u0027s just physically impossible it\u0027s not a it\u0027s not a technological limitation I was actually key to know this is a fundamental limitation of quantum mechanics and the last challenge is fidelity so in quiet in classical networks when you deliver a packet you basically either deliver it perfectly or you don\u0027t so you drop it by checking the checksum if it doesn\u0027t match you drop it and quantum networks delivering a perfect state is incredibly challenging technologically potentially impossible but also most applications don\u0027t actually need perfect states so they can actually get away with in perfect states and the key point to note about that is that imperfect states means you can deliver them faster so there\u0027s a trade-off between the quality of state and the rate which you can deliver things however as I point out below a kind of mixed trends these kind of things makes transmission difficult and the point is rather than in a classical Iowa query we send bits from source to destination we were not going to be doing that and in Contra now we\u0027re not delivering a qubit from source to destination instead we will distribute entangled pairs of particles to the two end points and the two end points are then free to do what they please were those entangled pairs and one of those things they can do with those entangled pairs is quantum teleportation which is data transmission quantum data transmission and the life cycle of and tango and roughly like what it perceives basically first you generate entanglement on a link you generate a pair on individual links on your path on all of them potentially in parallel so now you have an entangled pair on every link on your path from source to destination and then you combine them using a technique called entanglement swapping where you can actually combine neighboring and tangled pairs to create a longer bell pair and at the end you want to deliver that pair those two qubits that form that one pair to the endpoints who are actually going to then use it for things such as quantum teleportation but before you deliver to it to the end of an application there\u0027s three things you have to consider how the corrections what that effectively means is you have to either deliver always the same pair to the endpoints or you because there\u0027s one of four possible pairs that can be delivered and so you either always deliver the same one so "

    "text": "to try out and saying roughly there are two ways of extending open SSL and basically open a Cell provides an NG provides a way of extending open cell using what they call engines and they\u0027re basically a way for openness cell to offload some of the heavier computational functions onto Hardware normally and so if you have like diffie-hellman key a protocol you can actually offload some of the more computationally intensive stuff onto hardware that\u0027s what an engine is for you basically provide callbacks for the sink sweden hardware or you create a first-class key exchange protocol state machine the other one would record the first one doesn\u0027t actually require you to change anything in the open a cell code base the second one does actually require you to change the open a cell code base the team opted to go for to implement an engine they abused the diffie-hellman protocol so basically open a self but it was running diffie-hellman but really the callbacks were just doing qkd and what does their architecture if they look like so we provided a mock api in order to let one of the teams actually implemented an edition of the api so actually the hackathon they just had a mock which just didn\u0027t do anything quantum I just provided the API in a mock way and then basically they an engine difficult and benjin built on top of their security API that would actually communicate with the openness the library so we\u0027re just a call back to the OpenSSL library and the OpenSSL library would therefore do qkd thinking I was doing diffie-hellman difficulty and challenges and there\u0027s some the engine actually behaved differently on the server the client side but the callbacks were actually symmetrical and opened a cell and so that kind of was a challenge in the end the team actually implemented two different binaries two different openness silk libraries and also the design of the mock API was actually pretty limited because it was actually meant to be just be simple and so that we didn\u0027t have to spend too much time implementing a mock API and but it turned out and actually the design led to deadlocks and you wouldn\u0027t use the engines because of the way the state machine worked so they actually had to hack on the mock API as well and in the end they did there\u0027s actually running code on this github link and the conclusion is open ourselves actually quite difficult to extend and even the easy hacky way of doing it and actually something I didn\u0027t put in is like I found this project quite cold I saw a team working on it because we\u0027ve done a few of these hackathons already and very often people without a quantum background would spend a day or two just learning about quantum how do you combine gates what do they do it cetera where I said this will make actually could like really get on it actually implement an application and into an application so I found that quite fun okay am i speaking so actually I used to "
