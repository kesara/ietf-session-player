But, I wanna stress that all the hard work of getting meeting organized and done is actually done by Valerie, who's been, like, Alarm Long time serving chair of this working group. And so all the credit goes to him. We're just a pretty faces in the front of the room. So with this, I will give the floor to Valerie to lead this meeting. So, hello, everybody. It's, using TLS and application working group. Session. It's the last session of this so perhaps Everyone get tired, but, we need to concentrate to make slust session. We have pretending's agenda, but, 1st of all, well, 1st of all, I want to to to to Okay. Okay. Okay. So note 12. Not well.

Nokia, it was easy for us to migrate to, like, test TLS 1.3, right, with hybrid schemes and signature algorithms, we could enhance open SSL and other TLS libraries but we're still facing challenges with GTLS. Right? So what is the what is the stance on PTLS? Because have not even started figuring out a transition path from D TLS 1 or 2, 1 or 3. So I think that some insights on that would be helpful. Yeah. This document says, this does not apply to DTS. Sorry. You know, it's Yes. But we should we should figure out a path for that as well. Right? I mean, especially in 3 gpp, we use details in several places and and be struggling, especially because we can't do that with GTLS 1.2. Right? So Yeah. Yeah.

It doesn't use any of those charge words, but it says, you know, TLS 1.2 is frozen. We're not gonna do any more work on it. Doesn't apply to DTLS And the primary reason is because DTLS 1.3 deployment isn't widely available yet. Because open a cell thinks quick is more important, I guess. I don't know.

Good point. I didn't take it through clearly. We'll have to Fix it on the list. That's a really good point. And it's kinda subtle on. So this is Alan. We had similar issues with EPLS and TLS 11213. The way we ended up solving that was systems should be configured to use TLS 1.3. By default when they ship, And the only way to use lower versions is manual configuration. That's this seems reasonable. So to mention what what to talk to Paul's point earlier. I think this I think it's still in this draft. The DNS protocols, DNS over TLS, say, 1.2 is a must. 1.3 is a may. Because it they have it deployed base. Quick says TLS 1.3 only. And it says nothing before 1.3. So that's is the application the protocol or is the servers, the client will have to figure that out. Okay. So maybe short review is a little optimistic. Do it. Now it's gonna be a longer review. David David Benjamin. I think probably the way to think about this is what do you set your minimum version too because that's the knob that most libraries have. Interpreted at least the title of the draft to mean you want new protocols set minversion equal TLS13 by default, which I think is"

I am extremely supportive of setting the minimum version to TLS13 and up for new protocols. And and leaving the max unspecified. Yeah. Quick, Okay. So we'll continue well, we'll issue an adoption call. And and I have a one process wise question to Paul. Eve's document, got adopted and, became become in the RFC.

Right? And and I forget which session it was. It was Monday or Tuesday. I'm, you know, I'm here in Canada. That's what the hours are all mixed up. So anyway, I'm just wondering how, like, so you write this in this document. You know, people I guess we'll write a procom that they have 1.2 in it or they heat it, you know, say, oh, no.

So as part of that, we realized, like, entire ecosystem has to change because of this. And, then I started realizing probably it's good to put some of the evaluations that we are doing in a draft so that we can bring it to IT for attention and see if you're missing anything.

Next slide. Yeah. So we have now, 4 finalists. 1 for KEM and 3 digital signatures. And and there are several other digital signature schemes that are being, evaluated because of some of the limitations with the existing digital signature schemes that are there. Next slide, Yeah. So what what I'm trying to do in this draft is discuss the quantum ready usage profiles for applications using TLS to defend against both, passive and nonpath attacks employing cryptography relevant quantum computers. Next slide, Yep. So I went I divided the scope is drafted into 2 sec primary sections. 1 is the data confidentiality part and then the authentication part, data confidentiality part plays a prominent role, especially for attackers who are basically as if you're snooping into the traffic and recording all the TLS traffic of interest. Let's say of for sensitive traffic, recording that, and prior one day when when CRQs has become relevant, they could use to decrypt this data and use that for various, malicious purposes. Right? So data confidential is an immediate thread that we are realizing that we have to upgrade our systems, in case if attackers may be already, wire tapping and basically, recording all of the TLS, session data.

Right? In case if you want to support EQ algorithms, either the few ones or the hybrid ones. There's discussion happening in TLS working group a hybrid scheme is is is a working group document. I think it's pretty well. We could implement that and and basically test our, deploy testing our labs, We haven't tried the, PO 1 at. So in that draft, it basically, the client basically offers a concatenation of both the traditional and the PQCAMS, and the server offers the ciphertextrend. It's part of the public key. It it only offers hybrid confidentiality, which is a hybrid scheme. It's it's highly mature. We could test that out. Client can cash the service preference for key exchanges for future, TLS interactions with the server. We have also seen several, deployments regard to, from Chrome, Cloudflare, and and we have open source implementations already available. So this was quite straightforward for us to, experiment and, evaluate the performance benchmarking. So this seems like an a natural way that applications can start integrating the hybrid key exchange in their TLS profiles to start migration. Next slide. This was something that we found interesting, especially when we were evaluating with different MTOs and trying to see, with middle boxes and what kind of challenges that we are facing what we realized is that, if you if you send both the traditional and hybrid key exchange algorithm"

The alternative, I think that's the deployment that we were preferring to do. This typically in our deployments in respect to that, we could cater to more packet sizes rather than a failure scenario, Right? The second one is about indicating the support for hybrid key exchange where the client only offers the traditional, crypto key share for the traditional algorithm and says it supports the hybrid scheme. And then the server could respond within, hello retry request, which is an error message so that the client knows that the server supports it and The client can now retry the, client hello with the, PQM the traditional algorithm, which is the hybrid scheme. This seems like a more like an overhead with regard to, than the first approach, and, at least in our deployments, we are planning to leverage the first one but I've seen like, cloudflare and others have reported that especially with middle or age old middle boxes or metal boxes which haven't upgraded, the me, have issues with the first team where they see the client hello being fragmented across multiple packets, and they see it as an anomaly and basically drop the packets. Right? So I think it seems like unless those boxes get upgraded, the first approach may not be deployable in all the, scenarios, and the other recommendation would be to avoid, to of the PQM, public keys in the the client hello.

Next slide. Yeah. Coming to authentication. Right? I mean, In in our, applications, we use both PKA and internal CS. Right? And so we were evaluating primarily, dilithium and the other one, but, Falcon had some challenges with regard to the the the computation on floating point competition and, may not run on commodity hardware. So, and I see several working groups only progressing on the on on the other 2 signature schemes and, not doing any progress on the later one. Oh, So it helps protect against the on path attacker, which may happen much later in the phase. It's doesn't seem like an immediate threat. Lamps working group has already standardized the x.5.10 certificate using dilithium It seems like a way forward at least to deploy and test the authentication piece. There's there's a lot of discussions happening in several working groups on PQT hybrid schemes, PQT hybrid protocol, where, it's a combination of both the traditional signature algorithm and the pqsignature algorithms as part of analysis, I think the frequency and duration system upgrades.

Yeah. I was just talking about the composite signature scheme, which is what is defined as a dual signature scheme which uses, 2 different, algorithms and, that's the draft that was discussed and, there was a good support for progressing that. We already evaluate which of the the combinations that were discussed in that working group would, fit in some of our environments, but that seemed like a good path forward. There's several other, documents that I found interesting. I mean, just mentioning that for everyone's sake to see if if I don't know if any of these would get progress, but it's all these graphs talk about dual certificates, basically, where The primary certificate has a, linked to the new certificate and and and And in TLS and check, exchange, you could do exchange both of these certs to validate the identity of the peer with the the traditional as well as the PQM certificates.

There's another draft talks about deriving the, the the certificate from the base certificate, which has just a diff of the, the the other certificate, which seemed like a nice way of doing it.

Then the draft goes into some of the various application protocols that we see are pretty much relying on TLS. I mean, it's a huge list I started with some of the ones that I pretty much I'm engaged with. I'm pretty sure there's several other protocols, but this is just given as as pointers to see that encrypted DNS, hybrid public key encryption, which is predominantly used by several other protocols, WebRTC, which uses DTLers, and we are planning to use DTLers as well for securing STTP that's used in a 3gpp and HTTPS pretty much carries a lot of sensitive data. Next slide. Yeah. And and then the post quantum algorithms that are up a lot of have added several, details in the security considerations on how they're relatively new and and are are are going through a lot of scrutiny, but not at the same level that the traditional algorithms have already gone through, but, I think for instance, Skyber has been has been around for around 7 years, and it's gone through several evaluations. So there seems to be some confidence some of the deployments that we could do, migrate from, 6 hybrids to POPQ in in some, networks where CNSA 2.0 is mandating that. And for regulatory compliances, we have to probably to in certain deployments, hybrid schemes.

So it would be incomplete if we didn't talk just talked about TLS without talking about encrypted client. Hello. That was the reason why we had to add the HPA keyone, Right? Beyond that, there was no need to add that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

I also I'm wondering if if Utah is is the best match for this document because, like, like, mostly, I think, the things discussed this like, used TLS 1.3 wisely.

And I know, like, in the P Quip working group, for instance, we do have, like, use cases draft that that, I mean, you were talking a lot about use cases and different kind of mechanisms and stuff. Right? And perhaps"

    "text": "maybe there's some kind of collaboration there. Maybe maybe. Anyway, so I'm gonna take an action to definitely read your document and maybe I'll I'll send you an email or something to her and maybe there's some collaboration room there or or whatever. I just think, Yeah. Yeah. That makes in sense. Probably if we can present that occupancy. Okay, Mister Mohan. Okay. Thanks. David Benjamin, Yeah. So I think At the level of like, like, guidance on how to use TLS in Utah. Like, I think it's a little premature in that All of the documents that you cite here are, like, in varying degrees of not yet existing. For instance, right, the TLS draft may not actually currently talk about guidance on key shares, but maybe we should just put it in there. And maybe if the fine, if it turns out that, like, you know, there's some overarching guidance that doesn't fit in there, then it might makes sense to have like, utile level draft. I'm like, here's how you do, like, here's like the various choices you can make around key shares. But I think the sort of inputs to those decisions haven't yet been set yet. So I don't know if we wanna quite be doing that. And that's just on the, like, key share side, sorry, on the chem side, on the certificate stuff, things are even more in the in the air. Like, there are no There is no there are no mechanisms to find at all right now for using post quantum keys in as the authentication keys in TLS. And, like, some of the drafts I saw you mentioned are, like, this is, great survey of, like, a lot of the interesting work happening, but I suspect a lot of them are not going to end making sense in TLS. Like, I haven't seen a a use case in TLS for the, like, chameleon stuff. It's probably useful in, like, other kinds of applications, but probably not TLS where we already have a negotiation scheme. So I think probably, like, the suspect We will get to a point sooner for key share for for the chem's bits than the signature bits. Knowing what we need to provide guidance on in the first place, but we're not even there for the key shares bits. So, like, probably"

    "text": "like, in terms of an actual working group document, maybe maybe this needs to be sort of, like, divided up into pieces and you know, figure out what to do with it. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of work in progress. So this will keep evolving as it goes by him. Yeah. I was just I was gonna, respond to David there. In you mentioned the chameleon drop in TLS. So so, yes, there hasn't been discussion per se with TLS but there are use cases there that could make a lot of sense with TLS. Especially, like, the way the structure works, it could work really well for backwards compatibility. So that, I mean, there probably are discussions that need to happen and probably should happen. So, yeah, just It's Yeah. Those things just need to happen, and I guess it just needs to happen. So I don't know what to say. talk. Well, again, we'll have to Yeah. Thanks, John. I mean, I mean, at least for us writing in 3gpp, we use both tough. The public CS and internal CS as well. Right? So for us, In some deployments, migration is quite easy. Right? I mean, we basically provision all the network functions ourselves, right, and we can provision the root CS and we don't have any intermediate CSO. It it makes sense for us to do the do the the enhanced authentication seems much more easy than that we can all do it. I'm pretty sure may be applicable in industry, liability, and other enterprises use cases for managed devices. Right? So, so, based on my past experience. So I thought a yeah, my for applications which use probably the public C8 may not make sense. So immediately, but for other scenarios, we still have applications that run-in in in other domains where some of these drafts or work that is happening in lamps are still applicable Yep. Exactly. So"

    "text": "have some concern with the document the main concern is that, I agree with David that it's probably a bit a bit premature. To make some, recommendations for applications given the fact that, It's a core technology in TLS and lamps are not settled yet. So For example, TLS booking group is not you had decided, what's what was it able to do hybrid pure, and the same is for lamps. So, we can, adopt the document, but it seems to me that it won't be finalized until all this underlying technology, that in the other working groups are finalized So perhaps it will be a long life drafted that will be waiting 4 the corresponding booking groups, lamps, TLS, at least, for this to to finalize this it's a document about using culture use PCU stuff. So this is my concern. So it can be it can become a fee earlier than we'll get an arachieve from those. Working robes, So what do you see about this? I'm more interested like, in in, I I don't think the draft will be ready soon for becoming a going anywhere near working group last call or anywhere right. I think I think having, I think, this ton of work that is happening in several working groups, and it's gonna be like, a very long lived working group documenting even if it gets adopted, right, and I'm waiting for that, eventually to do and make a call, but, having this document helps us to have those discussions and figure out what fits, what doesn't fit in, and what is different approaches that we could recommend. That will at least help us decide the transition path, which is still being worked out in several other institutes. We're participating in and"

I I would like to You discussed a mutual working group. Yeah. I mean, I would like to see your comments from the working group because I've not seen any comments at So let the comments come in. I'll address the comments and then, maybe then we can decide, to do with the draft Okay. It seems that we'll, please stimulate this case. Discussion in the Mainland Eastern, and we shall see watch the Vulcan group since about, the maturity of the draft, the need Where was he? This is the right time to to issue an adoption call. And so Okay? Thanks, Valerie. So we've done with presentations, and I want Speaking as a reduced Coucher and, along this active participant, in Redex to Booking Group. I want to to remind that are mixed has, a a young Fred is called, so of the draft. That makes a recommendation for using, GLS in a radio's protocol, and, we basically need reviews from to a list aware experts. From the experts who are aware how to use their lesson applications. Of this draft. Because it is ready for last call, but we think that it's it's it's gets very few reviews. So please, please, please, concedure reviewing this draft. I've already sent link for this drop to the least. Hi. This is Yandfleet."

So I hope to issue a new version of that draft, sometime next week. And I will be sending a Mail to Utah With some specific questions or some specific sections that we would love to have a feedback on from people who Understand TLS In applications, probably a lot better than I do. I do. Paul Otis. Actually, at the SAG meeting, I asked specifically for reviewers for this document, and I got the following 3 volunteers Uh-huh. And Dan Harkins. So Please put it in a minute and send them an email next week. As a more volunteers, it's a bit. So because will get more volunteers. So, anyway, thank you, Paul, for for raising this topic in Zurich, I would appreciate And so we've done with the agenda of his presentations. So open mic any other any other business Go in once. Going twice. Okay. I sent this down. Sorry. John again, Yeah. I would just Yeah. Sorry. I know everyone wants to leave because last day, but, this discussion just made me think about I I know. Actually, maybe it should just throw it on the mailing list, but because because the first"

    "text": "Rich was talking about TLS 1.2. Oh, sorry. 1.3 not supporting PQ, and it just made me think of an interesting use case for a chameleon certificate because of its flexibility and, like, the other certificate could be PQ, but in your be classic. So you could actually use that enter. So it's still a certificate that has peak unit, but it but the in inner could be non PQ, which then could be used with a TLS 1.2 for backwards compatibility. Anyway, just an idea that that came up probably wouldn't maybe I'll just throw it on the list or something, but Yeah. It was just the first time I put the 2 together with what was said earlier and then what what Tierra was talking about. So, I don't know what I even thinks about that. Maybe, people think that's a dumb idea, but just, thought that could be Just just show that I guess there's different interesting mechanisms in this whole PQ realm that you know, could maybe even get around you know, things that we're trying to say, you know, don't do this or don't do that, but then, you know, could be these, like, edge things that people I mean, if people can do it, they're gonna do it. Right? So I guess that's something to consider. So, That's all. So have a good night, everybody. Or morning or whatever. It's 2 in the morning here where I am. So Take care. Thank you. Then So That's it. I done. believe we've Yeah. Everybody's done. This was the last meeting. Go see koalas. So have a nice trip with those who are on-site. And bye bye."
