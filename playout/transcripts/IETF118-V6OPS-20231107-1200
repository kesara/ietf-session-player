Next. 2 housekeeping XTO offers. Please scan the QR code to sign in with the blue seed please also use your mobile to get into the queue before you walk to the physical queue. Next. Today, we, again, have a fully agenda We have 1 working group draft 5 in the visual graph. Followed with the 2 very exciting, operational presentation. I used to put the site meeting also here, back, you, IAB member, or it might mean that it's not good to put it in the working group agenda so I will move it But again, please know that on Thursday morning and we have 2 exciting, side meetings please come to a tank. Next The working group, the number of individual draft working groups have, continue to grow. So I think that this is a book sign. But due to more working group, but you have an individuals who have I also feel that way the chairs, a little bit falling behind So we hope to, do some more actions to speed up the process. So we'll try to take some action IPV6 operation, XUs, these include the lack of motivation and lack of knowledge legacy devices and some operation exceeds Next So I would like to"

For extinction that you will see is all the policy, regarding the extinction header, please help him This will help us, understand the extension header which important Excel. Please continue to support Nalini and my on the enterprise ipv6 deployment Excel, and there are some other, task think maybe you move to to. For example, IPV 6, packet loss rate, can we measure a dam Can we clearly articulate the other Vantage of, ipv6 other than more address, and now we also know that ipv6 have another big at the bank is, which is, like, on worldwide average, it has lower latency IPV full. But anyhow, we needed to be able to clearly articulate the the advantage in order to convince more people to move on to ipv6.

The reason why I'm here is actually not because this was my idea. It was Nick. Because I was the come author of the previous idea RFC 3849, think with Philip Smith. That did V 6 documentation in the RSC series. Next slide. So back in 2004, that was published it actually cleaned up. A rather bizarre situation where to my knowledge, both AP Nick and the Ripe NCC and actually reserved V 6 prefixes, but hadn't really told anyone And there was sort of lying in the registry going, this is for documentation, but it wasn't a big thing. And we thought, you know, well, maybe we should a bit like RFC 1918 actually come out and say this is a private use address prefix and and actually coordinate across the entire community which we did. It was a slash 32. And At the time, you know, it's kind of interesting. Was a relatively conservative choice But what we've found, of course, is that these deployments of V Six are now pretty massive. And the 32 can't describe almost any realistic deployment now. So if you're trying to document a typical network in V Six, typical operational network, You can't use this documentation prefix as is. You've gotta lie about prefix sizes and make things artificially small so that the total sort of documented example doesn't overflow, you'll slash 32 Or you just gotta borrow some more addresses. And if you're borrowing some more addresses, why have a documentation prefix? It seems that a slash 32 is actually too small. Next slide."

A number of folks have had slash Ninteens And, you know, There are some big networks out there. So it's it's not completely over the top. It's certainly comparable to the larger V6 deployments. Yeah. Well, that's massive. But it says V Six. 49632s is in the slash 20. And the current pool, which we're operating out of, which is 2000 slash 3, has 536,000,000 536,000,000 of them So this is literally point 00076 percent of that space. It's a bitsy teeny we. So it's not really, oh my god, all that space. It's actually a relatively tiny amount of space. In the slash 20 next. So the idea in 2004 was, you know, that'll be big enough, won't it? And I'm saying to you now, well, you know, It's big enough, isn't it? I don't know. You don't know. None of us know, but it does seem unlikely. You know, I I I'm not sure how much the fantasy of the internet of things will get real to what extent the Silicon industry is gonna go completely berserk on us. That, quite frankly, We haven't done many slash 19 allocations over the last 20 years. They very, very rare. And, now that we've moved away from fixed /40 eights per side, and operators are actually making differing and variable uses of their prefixes in the way they actually allocate them through Most networks seem to fit inside a slash 20 comfortably for most examples. So a bit of optimism, bit of reading the winds, we think this is good enough."

So, yeah, let's do this. Thank you. I wasn't keeping track with somebody is somewhere. The tool is and Antonio. So, about 10 years ago, I presented, about the same idea, the same and you came to the microphone and lecture us about how it was useless.

I'd completely forgotten the beauty of human life is we tend to learn and if you don't, then then you're stuffed. And I would actually say for me, it has been a learning experience over the last, you know, 15, 20 years, wherever long it was. And I suppose with more familiarity with the patterns of usage of V Six, There was a period And I think I can put it down to 2005 to 2008 where we all got very concerned about the combination of the HD ratio and slash 48 insights, and what we were seeing, and I think the best example was Telius Sonara, had a deployment of less than 7,000,000 subscribers, but they wanted a slash 19. And under the rules, they kind of got allocated a slash 9, and we're sitting there going, Wow. If everyone does that, we're gonna reach the end of the barrel a lot faster than we thought. And so around that period, we kind of backed off into the conservatism of V Four. We changed the insight boundaries. We actually ditched a fair deal of the HD ratio the way it was being applied. And I I think there's now more confidence in those V Six address pools. And as Jen said, you know, in some ways, I think most of us on the addressing side of the world would say as far as we can see forward, Mana. 10, 20, 40 years. There's no looming, you know, scarcity on the horizon that we can point to. Maybe just attitudes change and we're we're learning more So, you know, people change. That's a good thing, by the way.

And my main observation is that isn't it nice We need to that we're seeing a lot of large deployments that need to be documented. Totally. Thank you. So, Warren Kari, my name main observation is it'll be really nice to have a documentation prefix that's clearly different to the existing documentation prefix because it's like when reading documents, it's really easy to get lost, like, which one of these I know we were we were kicking ourselves that we didn't actually get dzeroc0. Oh, that would be also would be awesome, but it's in the Ayanna considerations as a TBD. So if if some friendly AD wants to kick the Ayanna when they said, look at this going, you know, d 0c0 is actually not a bad idea. That would be a good thing Oh, some random AD. I mean, I do actually think that it might not really be a bad idea to have ask for an initial small one because, like, when you're reviewing a document and everything starts with the same prefix, It's really hard to keep them separate. So if you ask for this, and another small, you know, something so that you've already got, like, 32 Sure. But that's 2 of them. Anyway, Yeah. Ray Bellis, I see. Yeah, Jeff. You're right. It's a tiny amount of address space in the Grand other things, But, also think it's completely unnecessary to actually burn any global space for this at all. I mean, we're all set what, yeah, what's wrong with xxxxxcolon/16. In documentation and normalizing something like that, used to use some placeholders to mean This is some arbitrary slash 16. We've run into problems with extreme literalism, and APNIC does do some teaching.

To try and sort of make it real make it workable, but let everyone else in the world know don't route this crap. It's the documentation prefix. So that that was the idea behind it. Lorenzo clearly, I am I I do think this, having such a large, allocation isn't really necessary. Because there are there are networks that have more than, more than this amount of space, and there's also networks that have different multiple prefixes, and you can't do that with this. Right? So So for example, you know, at the Google network, I think, has 6 slash 32s or something from HRIR. Okay, when maybe that one's comes from Antarctica. I don't know. But, anyway, But but, I think that's also something to think about. I think maybe having fewer, smaller ones, what that might actually be more useful in terms of documentation. It's a view. Probably we can discuss it on the mailing list. I actually like that the large block single allocation. It's really easy to filter out. There's very little uncertainty about This block is non routable. How you would divide it yourself in documentation is kind of up to you. But it's a one line entry and a filter list, which makes that part of it just so much easier. Okay. We exhausted the line. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jeff.

Why another transitioning technology, will others that's later for now, It's because, we we will need it. So this, transition of transition strategy It's based on a different principle than anything that is used right now. It doesn't need IPV for addresses. Doesn't need IP before Internet, during transition, right, transitions to IP to pure ipv6. it And it needs only a pure ipv6 internet. This is based on the IP rack, which is an end to end address space travel. So So this is not, like, a specifically transitioning technology. It's another technology that is just used for transition. Purpose. This is a very brief overview because I don't wanna talk about IP iPhone to it is useful transitioning. But there are some key things here that need to be understood So, so SSN to end. So we're not not 6 filters and cross dropped a quality before ipv6. Stateless, massively scalable, important thing to understanding is that it uses special addresses called IPRF addresses, which is a combination of 2 items, one is the context address, which must be an 85 address and the reference which is really some number. And or vacancies, Some examples below, 192zerodot to that 123 and the plus sign separates the reference"

Again, I don't wanna spend too much time on this, but the things that we need to know. This is a busy slide. So let me guide you through it. At the bottom, there is a network diagram. It's pretty simple. There is internet in the middle. The network a on the left, which has a IPRF gateway and some hosts, and there is a network to the right, which has it's all night period of gateway. And some hosts. The way a period works, is similar to standards and network protocols. It uses also in destination addresses. Which are the same as it travels through the network. So this is shown at the top line. So the source is to the the 1 debate. 9+1979 and the destination is to the 1, the B8. Coloncolon8+2466. It is the same thing when it's, gets to the internet. And it is the same when it gets to the target, and network. What happens, I mean, to make its work, those IP addresses are interpreted at in each other's space. So in the network, a, it is interpreted an ipv4 address, of the host, a one for sample and the destination is some fake private address. In the internet, references make, no difference. So they ignored"

So, anyway, so it's on a private network and, and the destination is the others of the folks K. Definitely when you want. I think kind of works. And just have to press 2 buttons, if there's another one. So transitioning this is what I wanna talk about. How to transitioning works with IP RAV. So there are 2 diagrams here on the one slide. Just to conserve the space, So the starting point is all IP before. So the IPRF gateways are, installed, but not used. So the traffic goes pure IPB4 with IPB4 addresses for for destination and source and DNS returns directly before addresses. The first thing to do is to switch to the IPRF So the source and destination will get their own IP ref address and the gateways are installed. So now the same ipv4 traffic still ipd4. Goes through the IPR gateway. Now there's important things that is happening here The gateways, the couple those other spaces. So that network a can start transitioning right now"

So this is with the dash line ipv60 shown maybe somebody wants to start setting up ipv6 network. It's a pure ipv6. Even without, connection to the ipv6. It works in that. Okay. Next. Okay. So, eventually, network a does get internet ipv6 internets and you can start transitioning for good. And notice that he doesn't have to wait, a network being so it can set up some server on its ipv6 network and the local IP before clients will be able to reach it. And the remote IPV for client will also be able to reach it. If I be fix 6 client, it can reach a server on the local IP V Four. It can also reach a server on ipv4 on the remote network. It wouldn't even know that this is ipv4. So so this is case like 2 networks, network a network B, but in reality, in a typical, enterprise scenario, you would see, like, 20 of them, maybe 200 of them, So so that's step 3 is repeating several times. Eventually, some of them will also connect to the IPV 6 network. And then we can go through the ipv6 internet to the very same ipv4 server on the right on the or or may be the same clients IP before on the right can be accessing another server on IPV"

And it is not needed during the transition, not after the transition. K. Thanks. Next. Yeah. Okay. This is the point where if you have those, net involves networks connected to ipv6. You can actually drop ipv4. And you can sell your IPV for addresses if you want. At this point, transition is complete. Far as internet is concerned, And notice that, in enterprises they can still, continue with their transitioning at their own pace. And, again, this is still net worth, but maybe 20 or 200 of them and, yeah, whatever is done. On the right side. Doesn't affect what is done on the left side. They can just progress at some at their own pace. Right. So eventually, some of this networks will convert to APV 6. So we have IPV 6 on the right side the left side, we still have some ipv4 that, want to Hold on to for a while. He doesn't matter. He's still everything works. And 7 eventually, all of those 20 or 200 network do convert to ipv6.

And because of that, it looks like seat where other, technologies the existing technologies will fail, and there is, like, 3 cases well, this will happen. Chiefly among them is taking down IPV for internet. I don't think the existing technologies will ever eliminate IPV for They rely on IPV for Dual Stocks, ipv4, not 64ipv4. 464 extra ipv4. Not only that. You also need ipv4. Internet for them to work. So they will never be able to to to deny why with this. Therefore, I think is some such technology like Iperf will be actually needed to complete, the translation. That's because IPRA does not need IP before internet. Doesn't need need IPV for addresses, and you can drop it early. Not after transition is done, but when the transition starts Another case, the center price is where the cap the coupling of transition effort from peers is is usually important. Just allow us to work at home base, lower cost, lower risk, and the cost is a really, really, hugely driving force at the at the enterprises. Pure ipv6 and other thing. Nobody wants to do our stacks.

I think the document would benefit a bunch from some comparisons to things like lists or hip or something, which do some very similar things, and it might make a lot easier to understand. I guess sure. My answer is, right now, I just wanted to present another approach. Gentleman. To be honest, I am slightly confused to why you don't need you call IPV for internet because I guess your like devices inside the system will still need to reach like Twitter and other resources. And just for sake of time, Yeah. I agree with Warren. It would be nice to compare with other things because I'm not sure y people would choose this over technology which already exist and tested. Right? Because my main concern would be if you start churning off IPV for inside. Your main problem will be that application on individual endpoints fail without default. Right?

So this is the diagram that is showing again, and the network b runs ipv4 This is the ipv4 be behind an axle to speed. So this would be running something like translate network. It does not need ipv4globaladdress. Because IP address gateway will carry over over ipv6. I mentioned earlier that, IPref traverses not. And traversing not is hugely important in this. Are correct.

And I don't know that this solution could be implemented and commercialized for that's done. So if you have another if you have another And, also, I think the costs of keeping ipv4 running aren't that high. Because organizations kind of have the same dual stack approach. It's not very, very expensive for to keep doing it. It's more expensive than single stack, but we kinda do have single stack solutions for people who want to run them.

It is something that was originally developed, as a document in Rfc in V Six ops, and then we did a biz effort several years ago, And now we're here to biz the biz and we're V3 and now we have threes with very happy eyeballs on them. Sorry for bringing this icon back for those of you who remember that.

The ethos is all the same. And, we started this by wholesale copying, the entire document has to update into markdown and everything else. But it is this fundamentally the same document and same algorithm as V2 but with some changes to deal with the, changing landscape that we see in terms of DNS records and also the transports that we're able to use. Now this doesn't fundamentally change the emphasis on using V 6 and trying to promote V 6 and have this adaptability, But there are some deployment and, operational considerations that make this different. The biggest one is that we have to deal with an entirely new DNS record type. That can get us information that will influence the race. And actually, the SVCB, RFC actually just came out today. And so this is now very much official, even though we've been deploying it, and requesting these queries and getting the records back for several years now. And so this is a new record that alongside, and quality records can give us address in. So it can give us both V 4 and V 6 addresses back. So it's a new source that we need to deal with. It also has priorities, which is something that, otherwise would not be incorporated into the happy eyeballs algorithm. And it can also tell you things that are less directly related to addresses but still may influence which connections you prefer to have in your race. We also have the fact that I I think I think quick was around when we did happy eyeballs initially, but it was twinkle in somebody's eye, and now it is a full standard."

And, for the modern age where we have quick alongside TCP. So often, we thought it would make sense to rephrase the document in terms of more generic transport handshakes as the things that end the races. And there are also other things that SBCV brings up, like, security features like encrypted client to low, which they do not directly you know, relate to some of the timing impacts that give us good input of saying when we are doing our race and we are trying to select different addresses as more preferred over others, if we know that some of them support stronger or weaker security features that may also change the algorithm. So we can't have the algorithm be naive to different security postures of different addresses. So is mainly just for reference, if you're not familiar with the existing algorithm, previously, you had a couple different steps. You would query a and cloud ID and s records, you would send your AAA, you know, maybe, you know, if you had settlement order, send that one first. Once you get back the addresses, you sort them based on various algorithms and you stagger your connection attempts and happy I've also V2 had you put 2 v six addresses up first and then a v 4 address, and then you kind of alternate from there. Based on your assumed preference on your client implementation for a V Six, although you could be different based on historical data. And then you would race until the TCP handshake completes. So for cases where you have these new third records, these SVCB or https records that you're requesting. You're gonna now request 3 DNS records in parallel. That if you are configured to do that, the other way still exists."

As I mentioned before, there may be different security postures and that may need to impact things. But then from then on, it's generally the same overall approach. We just have new inputs to the DNS resolution stage. New inputs to the sorting algorithm. And the other difference is that when we're talking about when do we complete the race and when do we say, yes, address 1, it's important to include quick in that, but also bring up the point that you may want to race until if you're doing TLS to a TCP, server that you may wanna race until TLS completes. And I'll I'll, can deviate from the slides a little bit here tell you an interesting anecdote that we hit that really is very much related to v six breakages, when we were doing happy eyeballs, but we were not racing all the way. Through TLS. Because there are on some Carrier Networks, for example, TCP terminating proxies that are transparent. And you do not know you're going through it. But we'll you're you're going to the, you know, correct addresses and end host is dual stacked. And you think you connect to it. Terminate TCP to make sure you have a very, very fast TCP connection. You then try TLS through that. And the V Six addresses on this proxy are busted. It does not work. And it's very, very, very sad. But you can think that your happy eyeballs is working and you can essentially have broken V6 connectivity.

I think this can have some debate and some work on it. I think there's already some stuff on the list and, we've gotten some good issues on GitHub. So we'll continue to refine how things should work in this case, but The problem has gotten a little bit more complex, and we need to take more things into account. With regards to generalizing for quick, I think I've hit on some of these already. But We may also want to, sort things based on preferring services that have more capable ALPNs, because that may be an overall faster connection. So that may influence how you bubble things up when you're racing. And we had to adjust a lot of the other text to generalize beyond just TCP. For the ECH considerations for security, There are different options that you can be SVCD document, you can be, SVCD optional or mandatory, and there's some interesting consequences that come from that. So, This is what's currently written in the document. We'll continue to review that and continue to refine it. So for the next steps here, we've already seen some great active engagement on the list.

You kind of want a working group that's in enter all of the areas We'll just take you through Jen. Jeff Houston. Lorenzo is actually sort of started the conversation, which I think is important Yeah. Because the original idea on happy eyeballs was we knew from the start v four wasn't gonna magically just go away. And previous transitions, what we've found is if you had a preference to the one you want to go 2, and you use the other one only second then the old one which is die because the more you sort of permeate the new one, if you're preferring to use it, other one just disappears without any positive action. What we found though was waiting for a connection to fail was taking up to 3 minutes. Users don't live that long. They die. So, you know, along comes happy eyeballs and say, drop 3 minutes to a few milliseconds. Everyone's happy. And and kind of right.

At this point, you've strayed from the reservation This is no longer an A AAA address family choice. And it's quite a reasonable thing to talk about. Because when you start offering alternatives in SVCB, and you're trying to sort of negotiate between a client and a multiplicity of potential servers, a multiplicity of transport and the multiplicity of security, you know, arrangements.

Some size of automated AGs. And you see, the median here, is scaled down somewhat but I think that that degradation is acceptable. Just you see, 29% or So 10% is acceptable when you increase time for the number of connections. The next slide shows the number, the scalability of this throughput, Of course, it's the most important metrics. Because, you send many many packets through a single connection. And the scalability is, again, I think acceptable. So there's some degradation, but not matching this It means stable. And the other side of connection setup is connection, take it down, every connection, which is set up, then it has to be teardown. So it's with a different kind of measurement because we cannot, delete the connections done by man easily So, some some connections were loaded into the connection checking table and then the entire table was deleted. And to make the measurement a bit more precise, the duration time of the empty table was It's not selected. And of course, that's the communication latency was also subjected.

We have a lot of home gateways that greatly ask for giant prefixes works great, it goes to the gateway, and then it never gives out anymore of the prefixes. So the problem we're trying to solve here is have home gateways give out prefixes on the LAN interface by enabling PD. And almost through any mechanism I'll take at the moment. Because this has reached the point of ridiculousness. We're wasting a bunch of addresses in the home. They're not going anywhere. They're just sitting on the edge. So the original idea I had for this draft was to do it in a flat format, I got some pushback in particular because the e router spec at cablelabs has hierarchical, So I updated the draft. This go around. To allow for both. My main goal here is we just need to get prefixed delegation turned on in the land and have these devices giving out prefixes. They're both documented there. Now in it, they don't They can work. We've we've run some testing that they'll work fine in conjunction you can waste addresses if you're doing hierarchical. I prefer flat, but It's in the ear out or spec, and I I don't wanna get into a a work about that part of it. Just really just want prefix delegation to get turned on on the lands. So those are the changes I made. The changes in the last draft, I haven't gotten any comments yet. I would love some where that as I broke him out and said, okay, okay, fixed delegation, you must do that. Hierarchical, I added those. I took them directly from the e router spec. And then the flats are still the same where we we turn the other routers in the home into relays. Route it up to the router that has a prefix bigger than slash 64. Yeah. I mean, my main goal here is there's other other technologies that can use prefixes in the house. In the home in any network. And we wanna enable them."

They have flavor with flavor depth. Okay. And they specify that, yes, they absolutely read my draft, I I stole their words and where the bits are set. So they have rules about all of that. Yeah. I mean, the the problem with doing that is that I think it's a bad idea. And so documenting explaining how to do a bad idea seems like a bad thing. If they can do it, even if we don't like, tell, like, if if if We we could certainly we could certainly say that the DHCPPD server if it's asked to do what this document tells it to do, does the appropriate delegation. Yeah. That's been requested, but I think any additional information about why that would be done is gonna just encourage people to do the wrong thing because they don't really understand it. Gonna sound like it's better to ask for more. Say, hey, turn on prefix delegation and you should you do the flat model.

Yes. Yes. Yes. You're totally right. We should do it on both sides. I agree. Okay. Tom, you want to make a quick comment thank you. Yeah, Tom Hill from BT. I I was just looking at this piece about removing transition text and I I had to quickly Google those RFC references because I didn't know them off the top of my head. But I I think it would be beneficial to be a little bit more prescriptive about including transition technologies rather than making references to that they exist. Come on. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. Like, I I've never seen a CPG the mall, Right? And then the idea that we're going to pick 1 is not my idea of fun and the thing I wanted to avoid. I I know what you're saying. I think we could say you should do some of the transition mechanisms in there, but I, I don't know I cannot see us running around the small bird bush again trying to figure out which ones we want to suggest prefer is my fear here. I I do appreciate that conundrum. Yeah. Completely. However, When sourcing CPE. Yeah. One does tend to fall into an argument that involves why don't you support Yeah. But I can't get any of you operators to agree on which ones to deploy is the problem here. We're getting better at that. Not fair."

And, revision 00 is is largely a placeholder draft figure out what we should put into it if we decide that is a document. We need for So the purpose of pdper device is to essentially give the same behavior if you do PD to a host as you have if that host is connected to a network to a normal Slack. Basically limited to the single slash 64. And if you wanna extend that. You do that with, you know, a bridge, so some flavor of that. It leaves the door open for for further network extensions.

It only has a link local address. It had to be able to pick, know, a global source address from from the interface that you, assign the PD tube, but apart from that, there isn't very much change, but Rellies, we have you know, requirements, like that. So what this draft thus in its current. Version is to provide the network extensions, regardless of address assignment polls, on the northbound link, So very much, you know, written from the perspective of why having my laptop with a set of VMs or VM like processes on it that needs addresses, and it need need to be able to do those extensions if I'm sitting in a coffee shop or if I'm sitting on the ciscoenterprise network or if I'm sitting here at the IGR. CiscoIT is not happy about, they will not let me do a network extensions, extensions, but I want to do network extensions, and I can, so I'm going to But at some point, it's turtles all the way down. Right? This is essentially a set of Teams see routers, and you can stack them as deep as you want to. Some point you're going to run out of slash 64s. Right? The current PD per device draft, you run out as soon as you want 2 rooted links. So the draft suggests an ordered list of mechanisms to try both northbound and they suggest another list of or mechanisms to provide addresses elsewhere. But, I'm still upset about this, by the way, that it's turtles all the way I wanted a rooted fabric you know, what what a normal, you know, whose best network gives you or agency p gives if"

It does not need any or very little corporation from the from the northbound network. But it's what we have, right? So the types of northbound networks, and this is probably not entirely complete, but it's, you know, you can connect Slack Network, or Slack link, but it runs some sort of security limiting you to one MAC address. So you can't you can't borrow more addresses from that slash slash 64. You could be connected to a link doing just the HTTP, the 6 address assignment, we can do connect to one that does both slack and the Or you could be one that supports PD, but, you know, PD of whatever prefix lengths you get to And you could connect to one which does support PD, but, you know, hierarchical and and flat will will force the extending reacher to behave somewhat differently. Depending and if, of course, you can also connect the link that isn't ethernet, if if anyone is old enough to remember those, which where you can't be bridging. And the mechanisms you have available to you northbound, if you want to extend the network is, well, a PD client, if you can. Right? That would be your preferred choice, then you would get proper global addresses, then you would have end to end ricibility, you can try various flavors of, you know, bridging combined with ND proxies and RA proxies to borrow addresses on your Northstream link. Southbound, If you can't do that, you end up in in sort of this self sim similar approaches of you know, not 66, for example, if you have that requires you to have many address is available northbound as well."

You know, a slash 64 is an after number every network on the planet, right? We have infinite amounts of addresses if you use them wisely. So it would be possible to run a rigid fabric you know, southbound as well. But of course, if if the northbound supported, you know, HNCP, then you should do that. But that's that's kinda shopped in the dark, now. And similarly for, you know, for addressing, since this is, you know, you basically sort of Kate, Kate, this mechanism southbound. So if you're having our addresses, you could give Pete PDs outbound as well, of course. But if not, if you have a single slash 64, you can do that for slack and do bridging. In the proxy or or if you have less than a slash 64, you have to do the HPV 6 address assignment. of course, if, I mean, for VMs and stuff, you don't need any of these mechanisms, you can do Or, essentially manual configuration, which means, you know, configuration by software. And you can only see increase the size of your address space by, you know, combinations of ULA and and that's 66. That, you know, hopefully you will have a 64 all the links you need, and and then at least you can get to proper normal normal addressing. So there will be you know, the people of our extending will not be you know, 2nd freight citizens compared to the ones that are connected directly to the northbound lane. That's basically it.

You can do this. Doesn't matter what Cisco IT thinks. You can do this. Okay. We need to make it working at PB6. Preferably without doing the math that, like, makes it harder for app developers. So let's start off with that. As for host behavior, you're correct about the source of rest selection thin our plan for writing that up off was to wait for PD, 64 PD to get past, working group last call, and then, that text is in right now in the Mendoc that we're gonna present tomorrow.

For the, so that's a place to put this. We could do it in 6 months. I don't know. For the turtles all the way down thing, I think I think the problem is that there are 2 types of totals. That your turtles the turtles from the upstream. Right? And we need to find a way where the upstream turtle, which says you need an extra $5 for an X-ray pv a PB6 address. Is not going to constrain the the the the the the behavior that we can do down sort of, but in in in our area. So the I guess what I'm trying to say is what 64 PD is trying to achieve is basically at least get the address space that you need to extend. Because in theory, once you have a 64, you could extend indefinitely. It's just that you need to build a protocol somehow to do it. You could do Babylon 128. Whatever. I don't know. You could do you could do babble with 128. You could, like, basically set up a link local mesh and just do babble with 128. Why not. Right? So I think that's something where we need to really separate it out. And the final thing is, yes, please let's do please let's consider end to end. One thing that I already said, I think, on a list was we won't be able to separate the northbound versus southbound assignment policies if we wanna maintain end to end because maintaining end to end means that the northbound needs to give you exactly at least enough addresses to do south bound. And if you can't do that, for example, you can't say, oh, northbound is DHP V Six. And southbound is whatever. NPT 66 because that doesn't work, right, because NPT 66 translates a whole prefix. Anyway, just I I fully agree with you, Lauren. So now I think a a consequence of us failing to do network extension is that we end up withisc cascading, which have properties. If we can do better, oh, yes. What about Babble with 128? I don't know. Would it work? Jewish. Would it work? I can change the hosts. Tommy can change the hosts. That's all hard.

And the problem with current standards especially the cloud provider implementations is that usually if you get IPBC you get slash 128 and you deal with that, and that's basically wrong So I would really love to have some sort of specification that you know, if you are a node, you are allowed to get some ipv6 addresses even if just less than a slash 64, but this is just my personal problem.

And currently that has been migrated to ipv6. Just to give a bit of context into the size of our campus network. We have more than 45,000 terminals connected to the internet and with a new is coming up. The number is expected to rise significantly. We also have more than 350 switches, 1200 indoor and outdoor Wi Fi access points. And a dedicated data center as well. At our theoretical campus. So We lease our ipv6 address block from XC, and obtained internet services from BSNL, which is the local ISP. We've set up an ROA and, now we've advertised our ipv6 block, which 2404f20, slash 36. So I'll briefly go over the test bed set up at our campus. So we've designed it, such a way to isolate it from the computer science department subnet. Which is where the test bed itself is located we have 5, host machines, 5 test machines of which, machines 2 to 5 are, native VLANs with ipv6addresses. And on machine 1, we have an open sense router connecting all of these machines. We've also set up a GIF tunnel from, machine 1 to the NITK started. To have ipv6 connectivity over ipv4.

First of all, why any sensible human being will do that? First of all, because surprise, surprise, dual stack does not solve the main problem. The main reason to deploy a PVC It does not help you to conserve address space. If you're doing dual stack, you still assigned V Four NV6 and you still need IPV addresses, and we actually run out of private address. 6 And also, I hate operation dual step because It's a personal nightmare. Right? You have 2 planes and troubleshooting is hard. And also we have people developing. We seek stuff, and they really wanted to use V Six. So we decided let's get rid of IPV 4, well, not get it. Let's redistribute it. To places when we need it. So what kind of network do you have? Like enterprise network, a lot of sites, We do not use the CPV 6 for dress assignment. We use slack to give addresses to devices for to give access to APV for only destinations in the internet we use not 64 And if host needs a DNS 64, we do in Netflix for every side age. And actually,"

Firstly, it's centralized and it's important. So we have, some data centers which run the HTTP for addresses, and I'll explain and why I'm talking about the legacy protocol here. And for work hosts, we use dotonex, and we assign a lot of different villains to host based on dotonex. Our syndication is And again, on social media explain why it's important. So, could we click up? If think it was 2023 years ago when I came here, and told how we did our proof of concept. Well, we took our biggest Wi Fi settlement, which is the guest one. And turn off IP before there. The reason was because guest Wi Fi probably has largest number of mobile devices, which are supposed to work very well on B6 only. And we Yeah. Obviously, there was some use cases for before, so we created a dedicated SSID, which had IP before enabled. And we also did the same with a wired against network. Because we knew we will need to put some devices, where we have a business reason 44. The great thing about the project was that we proved that It could be done. And we reclaimed a lot of address space with which helped us to survive until now. And there is a link of presentation. I did a tripe, and I think somewhere Tiete for archive.

Competing with devices which really needed before, for example, like, bug books into recovery, and also other business critical applications like Steam And Spotify. And also aid, give very low visibility of issues because if IPV 6 unless this ID does not work, a user just moves to dual stack and never come back to me and tell me what's what's wrong. Also scalability, Wi Fi team, hates have in multiple societies. And on wire network, I just couldn't do this. Because I have a lot of villains. If I start doubling them, it will be, like, operational nightmare. And, yeah, again, operational complexity, multiple SSID. Everyone is confused. So 3 years ago, we realized we need something better. What really needed what I wanted is what I call the ipv6mostly network. When I do not create separate segment, legacy devices behave as usual. And devices which could be V6 only. Could signal ipv6 only capability. And if the network is willing to support only devices. They negotiate that, and device becomes somewhere. Right? So I don't need to change anything on the network.

Which looks like a showstopper for us. So we can stop the bleeding and start deploying new stuff. That way. And after that, we started doing incremental rollout which for me incremental or allowed means I'm taking the whole IP before enabled DCP segments, split them in, percentage. We are currently 90% I really wanted to stand here with 100% being like green. But my travel schedule. Yeah. It will be done in December. Before end of the year, we're going to enable option 1 way for every segment, which means, again, all macOS devices all phones will be So results. You know what? I can believe it. It was surprisingly good. I usually, like, skeptical and suspects since we'll get broken, Yeah. We we found some issues. Don't get me wrong. But it was no show stoppers. It was a few interesting issues, few cosmetic issues, everything I reported to Apple was properly fixed. Thank you very much again. I really appreciate that was amazing."

Average, there are sites which have more Microsoft windows of homewares But average utilization drops like like 3, 4 times. Which allows us We're doing reclaiming now. It probably expected amount of other space we're gonna reclaim. Gonna be congrats themselves. Just the graph. Large campus network. Internal, like, corporate wifi slash 19 initially, and see it's like 40% utilization normally. So I cannot downsize Right? Because if I make it slash 20, it will be 80% utilization, which is above the threshold we're using for increase in the subnet size. I enabled option 18. Well, it's not really typical network. Normally, it's like four times. It's not like 7 drop. But Yeah. We downsized it to search 22. One given segment gave gave me, like, 7000 addresses back. Great. I'm happy. Everyone is happy. Management is happy. Nobody complaining. So lessons learned. It will be more of them on Thursday, but we keep, talking here, like, how can we get more networks deploy a PBC How can I convince them? I'm sorry we cannot. The only way they're gonna do this is when they realize, oh my god. I'm running out of space. I'm trying to deploy a new office. And my automation files because there is no addresses in the pool. That will be the driver because I've been doing for 10 years in corporate And we really started doing something when we realized So you can get much further with a good word than a gun. In terms of V Six deployment, than just with the presentation itself. So second lesson learned,"

And that mostly is quite disappointing because you cannot really attempted until you charged it before. Like, one example I I'm gonna talk again on Thursday more about that. Your workstation works fine most of the time. But when you open your laptop, It might take between 5 seconds or maybe 5 minutes to get your DNS back. And, like, nobody complained until I turned before And when I did, we found the asset in some cases, And again, it's a race condition. You never said yet that, I mean, like without getting users on on Linux, right, because users do not report issues. Because of hate labels. Yes. Hey, bye. Both are great. But when we turn before off, you find out things. Even in I was absolutely sure. I'm ready, right, My laptop was sitting on V Six only network for 3 years, And I decided, yeah, we're ready to bow. I can go and move all my all my books to be 600. And then I spent here, well, 3 months during these very interesting cases. Again, no dramas but very interesting cases about, like, yeah, this less than 1% of the time, it might not work as well as So, yeah, as I say, I support high payables, but don't get into this false sense of security. If you're running dual stack, you actually do not know about what's really going on in the network. Yeah. I think I have 2 minutes. My favorite discovery, that's why this working group got so many emails recently. So I had a lot of devices which look like a host behave like a forced"

And now it doesn't have not It doesn't have IP before on upstream interface and devices. Very, very unhappy. Right? So Yes. Guess most of the people in the room noticed we are trying to do is this, Right? We're trying to let that extends the network legit But I'm not gonna talk about that anymore. Right? We have one minute and we'll need another 3 hours for So summary of non okay, the main, actually, the maximum number of complaints our support god. Was about we had a lot of laptops with ipv6design. Because for many, many years, every time something did not work, support people, like, try to disable ipv6 or helped. Great. Ticket closed. Nobody ever was thinking about how we're going to re enable it back. So we had to deploy some automation to go across all fleet of laptops. And they enable APV 6 back, So people can connect to corporate Wi Fi. Extension headers. Great. We need them. Surprise, surprise, because If you use not 64, UV 6 packet is always 20 bytes larger than ipv4. So even if you so if you get 1500 packet, from ipv4internet when you translate it, it might get slightly bigger that you can send out So it will create fragmentation header inside your network infrastructure, So I think it's quite safe to allow."

So your TCP clamping doesn't help. And again, come on come on shows that it will be very interesting discussion about What happened when the client starts moving between networks and how default address selection rule 55 is critical there. So, yes, it's a teaser. So this project resulted in at least 3 drafts. One of them will discussed extensively. And I just submitted 2 more drafts One is about how in general node, router, or cost shall enable 46 works And another one is going to address this client's mobility issue, which I'm not covering on this set of slides, but I'll be talking about, on Thursday. So next step So stay tuned for next year presentation. Promo is supports option 108. You can enable it. So if you're using Chrome OS, from, from books, try this on this network. And, yeah, it's what I'm going to do next year. Questions? Yeah. Lorenzo. You forgot to mention the many sees that you had to write for this to work as well, such as press 6 4, option 108, you know, like, oh, it's Yeah. We had to write. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. But, it's it's been a preparation work. Right? This is I'm trying to explain why this group is getting so many emails because I know some area that just complained. So so, I mean, I've actually caught her on some of these, so I probably shouldn't say this, but this is actually I mean, I never believe that this would happen so quickly. Right? We've been talking about ipv6 only for a while, but like not only actually doing this, And it you're not the first, right? Facebook, Google, in prod, they did it."

So think kudos for that. I mean, and given that this is, like, kind of non obvious, all of this stuff is actually quite new. Like, perhaps for a new option 108 to you. All of this stuff and you are you gonna write up a draft saying, like, here's how we did it? You can't say here's how to do it because people say, ah, but you're not using the HBV 6. So they won't use it. But you could say you could say here's how you can do it. Right. So that's something writing it up would be useful. Yes. To build this, I did not My manager told me that we need to write something. I I wanted to get to 100%. I wanted to get 200% on a zed and maybe on promos, but we'll see. And, yeah, I'm definitely not before December. I I hate reporting stuff, which I have but, yes, I will definitely share this. Yep. And and if there's anyone else in the room who runs an enterprise network and want to try this and doesn't require the HV 6. Well, let us know how it goes. You know, usually, you can't do Clap with the with the USB V6. Work. Right? So there are things where in this Anyway, so if there's anyone who wants to try this, let us know. And maybe become a co author because I think, you know, this can be done today. It's it's slightly tricky, but right after it's written down, I mean, I think Jen's done all the hard work. So or most of it, So we'll find out. It's hard, as a person behind Ripe Meeting Net work, I can tell you that, yeah, we implemented it already 2 right meetings in the past, and it is running, and it's going to be running also in the net that is going to happen in the next Stripe meeting, what we see is basically the same thing. So it's like yeah, let's say 70% ish of devices are running we fix all the in the network."

VPN on Android, we need to talk because cases when I saw it broke and was caused by either ease the fragmentation case, Right? Yeah. But we'll talk let's talk about this. Yeah. Yeah. So, basically, I will wanted to say yes that, it works And I would say, thanks for, getting all this supporting documentation and also one more thing I discovered yet that with the new version of macOS, it's seems that, yeah, finally, the DNS 64 is optional. So I'm personally now thinking about, turning of DNS 64 in some future write meetings. Thank you, Apple. I really appreciate Tommy Jensen. I got a chance to read one of those 2 new drafts. Put out very recently, the this morning, the one about recommendations for how Ciela should be activated huge fan because there is some confusing points there and multiple approaches. So it'd be lovely if we all agreed that one was preferable, Thank you. Of Sorry for keeping you so long. I think that Jane have a great presentation, but I have to respectfully degree with the number one lesson she mentioned she said, having no IP address is the only way you will do ipv6 and I will disagree because and user actually doesn't care whether it's ipv6 or ipv4. So if it's so you can make it so easy like, you know, Akamai. Like, Akamai, you know, last time in the London, IETF, we have a missed make a base, sailing, like, okay, you know,"

People in this room, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about organizations and management. And Zales people do not move normal. I don't. I know. Thank you, folks. I think you might say now it's easy because Jen has done it. And once she writes down how to do it. It'll be easy. Yes. Yeah. So Thank you folks. Switching. No, no, no, no, it's okay. What do you want? That sounds great."
