I heard many times this week. My name's Las Vegas. I work for Mozilla at my day job and I'm the IETF chair for a few more minutes. So let's get started. This is the note well. This is an, session at the like the other ones you've been participating in already, there's various policies, that govern your participation here. This room, but also in the IETF overall. You should really familiarize yourself with these mostly you agree with to follow our processes and policies. A disclosure obligation for IPR. You, acknowledge, especially in this room where we have, audio and photographers you acknowledge that you will might be recorded or photos or video might be taken off you, personal information you provide. We will, take our utmost care to do well with it. And you also agree to work well with others, in this organization At all times, please. And if you are bored, there's a bunch of documents on the bottom, that you can, refer to and read Online, if you're, a meet echo,"

And if you have a headset, if it, is usually a good idea to actually also use it and there's a whole lot more details about, best practices for this at the URL at the bottom. We have a pretty full agenda. I think we have a 2 hours. Lot if I remember correctly, and quite a bit of content to get through today. So I'm I'm gonna try and keep the presentation part to, like, an hour. So we have, another hour for the various open sort of, let's aspire to that. And also during the open mic, it it sort of helps if you can be concise when you ask questions, and really, that other people also get a word and so. So please try and do that. You have a lot of time now in the beginning to, like, really hone your question to a fine point. So good to welcome. We have a host presentation from in serve of Google where the cohorts of this meeting we're gonna have the regular, reporting from the various boards and groups it was slightly longer, presentation from the LLC. This time about some of the financial situation. And and relationship between ourselves and the internet society, Warren's gonna talk to us about ipv6 and the permit that they're planning their the NOK planning. Either for Vancouver or, a a later IETF depending, I guess, on whether equipment does what it's supposed to do in Vancouver or not. We have 2 brief, in memoriam sessions. Followed by the 3 open mics for the various bodies. And we're not bashing this agenda. So I'm gonna move on my thank you everybody who makes this happen as always. The secretary is doing excellent work. Been here for a long time. I'm getting an echo from somewhere. The Mead echo team has been great, at cancelling that echo and many other things this week."

And I wish I could be there in person with you at IETF 119. Unfortunately, my calendar didn't cooperate. Again, this year. However, I hope that you'll forgive me for only a virtual presence. First of all, I'm very proud of the fact that Google has able to help sponsor, this year's IITF meeting in Brisbane. I should have opened with Gadai, but I was pretty sure that Jeff Houston would go after my mispronunciation of Australian English, so I I won't do that. But I do want to observe, why what you're doing is so important. The internet is sort of a 50 year phenomenon now, as you all know, that first important paper published about it was in 1974. In the IEEE transactions on communications. And now we have 50 years later a glow girdling system, unfortunately, some of the challenges that"

Well, okay, social networking as well. All of those things have potentially toxic downsides. And the question that, we ask ourselves in the meetings is whether there are any technical means by which we can moderate eliminate or at least mitigate some of the harmful potential behaviors that these systems enable. We're not gonna succeed absolutely in preventing people from misusing, these technologies. We all know that. But it shouldn't stop us from trying to put some friction into the system. And, of course, we know that if you can't stop something technically, then the next best thing is say, well, if we catch you doing that, there'll be consequences That's all about law enforcement. And as you know, there are big debates going on right now about kind of internet. Law, cybercrime treaty. Which is debating, you know, what things are crimes in the online environment and how should they be addressed and how the country's cooperate with each other in order to track down parties, it should be held accountable. But I hope that you'll spend your time, I hope. I hope, a little bit of it, out in the vineyard. Sampling some of the wonderful wines in Australia, but also working hard with, your working groups and areas directories to help move this body of technology and standards along in a way that will help support the its use.

I think it's been announced couple of days ago, I wanna say, As of today, I wanna say we have almost seven hundred people on-site. Is tracking unfortunately a little lower, than we expected. But we did look back. It's been a long time since we went to Australia, but already, like, 20 years years ago. I wanna say we were here last. We saw a, unfortunately, similar dip in patients. So it wasn't unexpected. We see an uptick, in remote participation. That's corresponds to the in in person dips. So overall, I think we're looking, pretty solid in terms of participation. A lot of the remote people took a advantage of the fee waivers, like, over half of them. So that's what they're there for. If if you do have a chance, to expense your remote participation. We do ask that you, do that. Because it really does fund part of the organization. Remote participation is not free. But those of you who do need the fee waivers, also please do take them. For the on-site fee waivers, I got 10 requests, and I granted 6, colon on the IRTF side. Had one request that he granted, and He runs a travel grant program, which is not quite the same as a fee waiver, that, brought additionally five people in. And also, the APenic foundation, hosted, or offered a grant program for people out of their region to attend the IETF, and they funded another 20 in person attendees. So this is something that you know, if you if you're hosting a future meeting in a region, this is totally something you could do. Right? Not gonna stop you. From doing that. So so that I think that is a very nice, at least first, time we did this, worked really well. Worked really well. Hackathon 300. So so over half the people on-site were there for the hackathon already. Is a very successful event.

And and it turns out there's, I think it was 50, people from, Turkish University that took 3 waivers on our participating. Which is is great, but it's also welcome, to our friends in Turkey. I I wonder if it's a one off or not. So if you send us an email about why you're doing this, and and whether it's been successful for you, I think we would love to to know. registration. This is a slide that shows the meeting As sure, why I am doing this? Still not the time for questions. Meeting registrations over time in the post COVID period, starting with the Vienna IETF, which had a very low in person participation, to now, you can see that we're track down a little bit. But I think in the overall participation, we're still relatively stable. So we're gonna see what happens in Vancouver, and then in wanna say Dublin, Thanks, sir. Yeah. That's right. But thanks to those of you who made it, here. The ISG, did a bunch of statements and announcements. We appointed Kristen Burton to the ICF Trust. After asking for feedback on on the candidates, We, yes. We, rearranged the areas, and we created the width area. And I think that tonight is actually when sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of transition formally happens with the transport, area being dissolved In the data tracker, I guess, also, it's already empty, but it still exists as an area.

There's also non pending anymore. And a lot more of the reports are available online in the data tracker where all of our other materials are as well. And we have a blog that, occasionally, I wanna say weekly, roughly gets new content. If you are doing work in the IETF that you think is of interest, to the blog, Greg, over here is very happy. To talk to you about co authoring or authoring something for the blog. Get in touch with Greg, or email the ISG, and we'll get you in touch with Greg. We have childcare again at this meeting. It's been pretty successful as always. I heard good things. We have, I think, 4 kids. That that, in the day the daycare, at least part of the time, This is something we're planning basically to to do, forever. So if you, have kids and you need to you know, bring them or want to bring them, you can. There's no cost associated with this. We, usually email out that that can call of interest so we're just we can plan accordingly, for the number of kits we expect So if you see that email for Vancouver or for Dublin and you wanna take advantage of it, please do. There's no cost, and then it really makes it possible for people to attend the sessions that otherwise maybe had to be remote or maybe not just hang at all. And that brings me to Myra and the IAB.

We also published a statement about client, mandatory client sites scanning, which, created some discussion might be interesting And we had an appeal and responded to it last year already. And then a really exciting thing. We have a new website. Yeah. I just thought, you know, the website should halfway represent that we know what the internet is about. So hopefully that treads more trust in the IEP. But, we also moved a lot of data or information to the data tracker and might make, like, the website. Hopefully, more, make it more easy to find things on the website. So if you have any comments on that, how to further website, please let us know.

Stephan's very deep knowledge about the law about copyright and about the IETF have been incredibly valuable, and he will be missed, from the trust although he's not gonna go far and I'm gonna bug him with a lot of questions forever.

Yes. Thank you very much. Okay. So the trust is also very boring. So, we have things set up to be fairly automatic in that, you know, the copyrights, assigned to, drafts when they're submitted, are all automated. We we flown to the system. We don't have to write individual agreements. Reduced drafts and they turned to RFCs. They get usable without us issuing new licenses. So we issued no new written licenses, since our last meeting. This is exactly how it should be. It's an it's a smooth, very efficient process. The only time we issue a new license is when we have to do something extraordinary out of the norm. This is awesome. It means things are working as designed. We had one licensing request that came in, and they it was from an external that wanted to use some stuff. Resolve that. We didn't have to write any license. We pointed them at the process. They could already use the license. And they were all satisfied. And we successfully did not either get sued or decide to sue anybody. That's always a good thing. So it's been a very productive in the only thing I wanna talk to you about is our restructuring as you have been on this journey with us for the last couple of years. They trust, did a public consultation with the community. Should we restructure from a Virginia trust as we, we're operating since 2005. there's a lot of reasons for the benefits to both the IETF and to the trustees as well. To restructure is a a Delaware, not for profit corporation. That corporation got stood up in December of 2022. And I'm here to say that we are moving along very well."

And one of these we found out was we had 6 palettes of stuff still in storage in Virginia. So Last year, we sent a team down, to pull all those boxes. The those palettes out, go through it, find stuff. We found a lot of stuff. LOTA was junk. but we did find some good stuff. We found, old proceedings from the IETF, paper copies that we're gonna have scanned to fill in the blanks where there's missing proceedings or they maybe we're scanned with poor quality. So that was a wind. Found a lot of blue sheets when we used to do things on paper. We're gonna get those all scanned. Upload to data tracker. So that'll be part of our archive now, and we won't have to be storing paper. And we also found a lot of backup tapes. So LTL tapes. I mean, this is this is ancient history. We're gonna go through that and figure out what it is. The stuff we don't need, we're gonna toss. The stuff we do need, we're gonna keep but spring cleaning is going has been really awesome helping us do that. And finally, if you wanna contact us, there's our information. You can send us email.

Developer, moving on, So, for those of you that aren't aware, we have global hosts and global supporters who sign a multi year commitment 6 or 9 years. And you then host the meetings on a regular cycle. They're the ones for whom we receive the bulk of the financing for for meeting sponsorship and these are very well committed organizations, many of them as well as also being sponsors in that way give us other things such as equipment or services and sponsor other areas as you've seen. So thank you all very of these as well. So for this meeting, we've made a number of improvements to our on-site experience. The main registration desk now opens on Saturday morning. That's a seamless process. It used to be a smaller registration desk available then just for the hackathon badges. And so that that's made life easier for people. We have a single shared workspace that combines the lounge and the terminal room, and that appears to have worked very well. Perhaps just using a different name. That's actually been relatively busy all the way through, whereas the lounge and the terminal room really were, quite dead normally. We're also putting a lot of effort into reducing waste. So we now have this, single badge, it is, sustainable because it's made from cardboard and it's locally produced and it can only go one way around. That's the intelligence test if you around with your name on it. And we can put useful information on the"

And, while I know this up, some people, we are reducing the on-site food to minimize waste because we had far too much being thrown away previously. So and all of these are largely driven from the feedback we get the post meeting survey. So just a reminder, that the post meeting survey is very important for that. So we have IETF 120 coming up in Vancouver. We will be opening registration for that. Soon. This is one of those meetings where we strongly recommend that you try to take one of our rooms because of the prices of we will have a much cheaper the price than, if you go at other methods. And these are our future meeting locations and venues. So we have Vancouver July, have doubling in November And then we have the 2 of the reorganized meetings early next year. We have Bangkok in March and then Madrid in July. And we're hoping to announce North American meeting, within a a few months anyway. So, just very briefly, The, a little bit about the draft report the 2023 community survey. So the, we held the 3rd annual IETF community survey from December 2023 to 20 January 2024, sent it out to 49,000 email addresses, got over 2000 responses, and that draft report is now available. And comments are welcome until 8th April What I'm gonna show you is just very briefly, the key findings from that report, We're very interested in your feedback on these things. This is, you know, our entire the data, you may have may have different views about that data, you may think different things need to be bought out from it.

So very briefly then The IETF is good at delivering its mission and principles but could do much better. So there is very, you know, very strong agreement across the community that the IETF produces high quality relevant RSCs in an open and transparent manner. The IETF has considered a very important organization, and most astonishingly that it outperforms its peers in all respects. So We ask people a direct comparison. How do you rate the IETF compared to other SDOs? In a series of, questions and in each one them, the IETF came out better. of So I won't go through them all, but there are some more key findings there. Well, I will go through the bottom 1, actually. The IETF still has a problem with gender diversity. We still have, you know, a small percentage of our participants here identify as women. And, nowhere near, you know, the population, normal percentage of the population. So just to finish off. Few more key findings that you need to look at and read in the report, but the bottom one is, my favorite one that email is still universally preferred. However, slice and dice the data by age by type of participant, by gender by anything. People love email. So, little salutary lesson for us to take away. Okay. M it for me. Thank you. Let's see.

We're also working on closing some deals, this quarter for fundraising. And we've begun to pivot from our more broad based fundraising approach that we had been taking previously that wasn't bearing sufficient fruit to one which I would describe more as a more targeted, one that's to industry, segments targeted to sort of what are those segments of the industry using from a standard standpoint why did they depend on the IETF and why was that important? And so therefore, you know, what are the benefits? And then we are planning to apply to the 1st round of grants that I can have. So They created years ago that the GTLD program they had, you know, 100 of 1,000,000 of dollars that came into the organization and decided to create a grant fund for that. And the 1st phase of that are the sort of smaller grants that are coming up now with the $10,000,000 grant fund. So we intend to, apply for that. But there's still a much larger grant program coming which I'll refer to in in just a bit. Of course, a wide variety of ways you can get in touch with us no surprises here. So in terms of finances, I thought it would be a good moment because we're now 5 full fiscal years through the LLC being in place. To do a quick check-in on, you know, what what's the longer term? Because, you know, if we go back to this, we're often presenting what are the most recent quarter, month end or year end. So it's sort of a myopic of you, not really stepping back and looking at the bigger picture. So I'll skip through some of the slides in in terms of being brief, you can look at them all, on the meeting website but if we look at 2024 as an example, I saw it because providing about $7,000,000 that $2,000,000 in registration fees are expected 1,600,000 of revenue from sponsors and a $1,000,000 of donations.

    "text": "part of the reason that we talk about these things and and we're going through this as we went through a process after COVID talking about meeting registration fees and increasing those. Why do we have fees for things like remote participation and so on. We heard a lot of things in the community about why do we even need registration fees at all? A source of revenue, why can't everything be free? And, you know, we said aspirationally, that was an important thing. But, you know, there's some challenges to that. And one of the things we were also asked is why can't ISOC just give every dollar that, you know, PIR generates to the IETF, you know, why isn't that possible? So this explores that to some extent. The first off is thank you very, very much to the incredible support that we have got from ISOC over the years. This is an important an amazing commitment. This is all of the dollars that are committed, either that have been given to us under contract or that are now under the new agreement, which is through 2029. That over that period is $76,000,000 you very much to ISOC for that, over that period of time. So really pleased with that. And, that provides a real foundation for able to do long term planning at the, at the IETF to invest in all of the, the things like improving the tools and processes you know, continuing to have meetings and so on. And then let's look at our income, and this excludes over this period things like investment Obviously, there have been ups and downs in the stock market. So we're really just looking at sponsorship income, registration fees, donations and then the eye suck match. We can see very clearly A dip, a dip, primarily related to meeting registration fees during the COVID time when we went full remote, and then we began to have hybrids again,"

And I think we've come out the side of that pretty well from a financial standpoint. So let's look at this very simple view, and then, I believe we have Andrew Sullivan, remote who's going to jump in with a slide or so from ISOC But one of the questions we got was, Why can't just a 100% of our meeting fees be paid for by the Internet society, And one of the challenges with that is there's this thing called the public support test for non profits. And the important thing to ISOC be because we're a part of them financially and legally, is that, to meet that they require revenue from sources other than PIR. And one of those sources is the meeting revenues that we get from, from here. So that helps them indirectly meet their public support test. So with that, I believe, Andrew, we have you remote. If you wanna go off Mike, and tell me when to go ahead. I think I have it. There we are. Hi, everyone. You can hear me? Yes. We can. Thanks. Yeah. So so there is this public support test and it's it's a requirement of the, of the IRS I won't get into all the details on here, but this is an important part of our of our function. Next slide, please. And and the the the way that this, works is that you gotta about a third of your income to be, to be part of this public support. That's how you show you a charity. And the IETF is part of the internet society, so from the from point of view of the IRS, you just are the internet society that isn't true for legal reasons in it and so on but from for tax reasons it is.

But if we were to increase the amount of funding that were available From PIR, which would be how it went to the, to the IETF. Then, you know, that would that would cause problems for us. Next slide, please. So the the the the thing to understand is that this is a this is a very complicated uh-uh calculation. It's not something that you can kinda do on the back here. Napkin, because it's this 5 year, rolling on, number and you can see it it fluctuates somewhat. One of the things that happened is there was a big contribution to the IETF from, the internet society or from the foundation really, in 2018. That's rolling off. And so, you can see, like, there was this big there there was this big drop, around, 2015 to 2019. That's rolling off next year. So things will, will will go back up. And we'll start to see improvements on this as well. And that's part of the reason for the long term investment that we we try to make in order to keep things, keep things even I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail here because I understand we're short on time, but I'll hang around. So if there are questions later, I can certainly get to them. Great. Thank you, Andrew. So continue continuing on, you know, the related question that that then flows from that is, you know, is there a a challenge with the tax and ownership, you know, aspects of this in terms of us being a disregarded entity, will just say that it's extremely complicated any change from the existing, financial or or tax status of the LLC has impacts and is difficult. So I will say that we are going to study that, but, you know, we know from, you know, talking to ISAC that extremely complicated and, you know, would be very difficult and probably not have a perfect, outcome to make things magically better from a public support standpoint."

And I'm gonna give an example of that, which is the domain name industry. Now the IETF created the domain name standards. We create Lots of new, resource records that drive demand and all of those things, you know, stave off the rise of alternative naming systems, and, and and all of those things. So by extension, you know, I can, TLDs, registries, registrars, all of those, organizations are likely target segments here. And, you know, have, a focus to make sure that, you know, there's continued growth than the DNS, continued demand for domain names, and and all of those sorts of things. So in the grand scheme, and I don't mean this as a a negativeness necessarily for the the domain name industry, but across all of these segments, what we're trying to move people from this sort of muchers in a way to boosters, right, people that are just sort of using the standards making in many cases 1,000,000,000 of dollars but not contributing back to the organization on which they depend, from a standard standpoint. So we'll be creating you know, very targeted messages to go, to those segments with the IETF excuse me, with, DNS being one of those things. And we are also in particular looking for multiyear commitments from those organizations. The ultimate goal is to develop a base of organizations that are contributing essentially an equivalent to what ISOC is able to do for us today. So we are doing that. And, Well, of course, do some of the documentation about some of the the challenges that would be entailed in making any material change to the existing financial or tax direct, structures"

So this is a proposal from the IETFNOC to move to an ipv6mostly network. Because we think it's time, And you might remember us from such presentations as moving from.1 to WPA 23. Which we did in Prague, and we're still doing now. And seems better. Other than, you know, people who turn on their radios and wouldn't turn off. So what is this ipv6 mostly thing? Anyway, Basically, clients that can operate without APV 4 address, signal the spec to the network, They include DACP option 108. Tell the network that, And then assuming the network supports, that 64, It replies also using DHCP option 108. And the client basically just doesn't bother giving itself a V Four address. I could ignore some address from the network. Then to reach native ipv6 sites. This this client uses V Six. And to reach things like GitHub, which are V Four only,"

They simply don't include option 108. And they get a b 4 address just like they do currently. However, as part of this proposal, We would also like to move the IETF SSID to be using RFC1918 space. And we'll provide net 44 That will make the network look more like what users actually get also what developers get most of the time. We found some people's, laptops, especially enterprise networks, if you give them a V Four address, They get frightened and confused. So However, if change scares you, Don't worry. It scares me too. We will, for the foreseeable future, continue to provide an IPV network with public IP be, sorry, public V4 addresses. Just like we do currently. So why am I mentioning all of this now? We're not actually sure when we're gonna do it. But, mentioning it now. Because we build this network for you, and we would like feedback.

Your interest. Cousin' Okay. So, I'm honored and, obviously, saddened to be here tonight to talk about, Dave Mills. Who passed away earlier this year. So for most of us, Dave Mills was the inventor of the network time protocol. And the expert on network time synchronization. But he was actually a lot more than that, obviously. He earned his PhD in Computer Science, University of Michigan in 1971, He worked in academia And Industry prior to joining faculty of the University of Delaware in 1985. He was involved in the early DARPA projects, that led to the internet and to the IETF. He was chair, of the gateway algorithms and data structures task force, which was actually the precursor to the IITF and the IRTF. He published 27 RSCs from 1981, to 2010. And these went beyond network time synchronization to internet names, routing protocols, and authentication schemes. He designed and implemented the fuzzball router, several of which were part of the original 4 of the internet. And while he retired in 2008, he continued to teach and pursue research interests since that So for me personally, Dave Mills was the original Internet gray beard. I first met him in the early 19 nineties, And, I was working on a project that was using NTP in real time system. And I was funding research to support him And so over the course of the project, I would dive up to the University of Delaware."

This was in 1990s, as you recall, so that I could remember all the important bits that I had missed along the way I was only a few years out of university myself, I felt a little bit like Alice in Wonderland when I went to see him. For those of you who know him, he was quite the personality. He was passionate about computers and clocks. He'd like to show off his latest projects in his lab and he tell stories of driving his teasing clocks. Down to the US Naval Observatory in Washington, to calibrate them. He liked quirky names like Fuzzball Routers and false ticker clocks. And he often drew on the words and images of Alice in Wonderland and the wizard of Oz. He also held strong opinions. He had a disagreement with John Postell about the use of PDF and RFCs. In his opinion, ASCII was just not rich enough to properly represent mathematical equations and graphs for the network time synchronization protocols. The agreement we made with him to get NTP V4 and the auto PR sees published was that we would handle all the formatting and tooling, and he would provide the text and review He was fighting for additional formats for the RFCs long before the IETF was ready to cross that bridge. He had poor eyesight his whole life, and he eventually went blind. But he last came to physical. IETF at November 2004. He didn't walk the halls in recent years, he did keep an eye on things, especially the NTP working group. And he would pop up every so often. To inform us of the errors of our ways.

So here we are kind of in hybrid for better or for worse, like all return to office, but the thing that that I think I really wanna highlight that Lars did, he pulled off all of the good things we got from the remote part. With remote, we pulled in a lot of other new people in the organization, and we've been able to keep them we have all the benefit of the participants we had before. And then the enfranchisement, all of the all the other participants we have. So that was phenomenal. The other place where we've really benefited from from Larson's vision is broadening broadening the effect of what is the IETF beyond traditional things like routing and addressing. He's really focused on broadening that kind of that reach. We've seen tremendous growth under under his tenure in sect in art, bringing open source kinda closer. And that's just really increases the impact of what the IIT IITF is doing. So in short, I just wanna mention across all of Lars's leadership, roles been this common thread of dedication to getting it done really looking forward to the vitality and long term success of both the IETF and the multi stakeholder internet governance model. So Lars, kind of, thank you. You know, really, what you've done, we will really be resting on"

Very different, and enjoyed the DNA, but My question is really see, I I've been part of IC. I also IQ anyone I typically for last, more than a decade. And I wanted to feel what exactly it is about the same. That's why I'm here. My only question is that I will as as well, I do standardization digital infrastructure and ICTIC IETF is pervasive. Across use cases, across problems, IETF RFCs are pervasive. But we do not have any structured less or relationship collaboration with any of the global SDRs. We do not and we pick and choose out of our own limited knowledge of some some IETF policies for building our own stacks for whatever use case, whatever requirement may be. We do not have any insights into What are the latest? And the upcoming or the car, right, but the best RSCs for any particular use case or for any particular kind of requirement. Do we have some kind of a structured tutorials I get that people can refer to, or maybe we can have some collaborative thing that we can have some such a give and take guidance to the other STO's stakeholders how to you leverage ITS latest work done and in a team tomorrow I I I can take this over here. So actually, the next section we'll have is going to be the IAB open mic sessions.

Instead of that, we also, and the IB also handles, like, outreach other programs like that. So I think, That's a discussion we're happy to have. Thank you. Can can I just ask you a clarifying question? You're asking saying we basically write a lot of RFCs. Can we make it easy for people to find those RFCs and understand which ones they should be looking Is that the question? Yeah. So so suppose I'm working on a problem. I'm trying to build a stack. Was basically doing a couple of different uh-uh already developed standards, RFCs, and all that. I do not know which are the best ones. So, but at times, it has happened I picked up an old generation of, say, ipv6 or maybe a 6 or whatever, There are already new ones available. Or whichever the same, and we have no idea. Right. Okay. So I think if there's a structure kind of some kind of, informative know, guideline something for to outside us of the this is a big, very good, meaningful community. That will be really helpful for other SDR stakeholders. One thing we're doing, over on the LLC side is that we're gonna do a heavy remodel of the IFC editor website, which will make it much clearer what the relationship between overseas is and make it easy to pick pick the right one and not an old one, for example. Other thing I was gonna say is that the the IETF is a little bit different than other SDOs in a sense that we we're building I think all of Kirkman has this slide. We're basically building Lego pieces. In the IETF. And you can assemble them into an internet, and you can also put them together build a data center network with them, or you can do something else. Right? And and we're we're pretty good at defining the Lego pieces, but but we are not really doing the federal style architecture of here is how you build a entire system out of it. And It's not really the style of the work we do, but that doesn't to say that we couldn't try if somebody, like, yield."

Over here, like, to to solve this use case. Yeah. So foreign. We also used to fairly often publish use case and sort of architect documents, which did a little bit cover, you know, what the use case for this protocol is or how these bits kind of fit together. We haven't been doing that as much as we used to. One point, we sort of decided not to really progress those as RFCs which maybe is something we should reconsider. So so maybe we could do some pilots together for some some system level. So some particular use case system architecture and what what would put best to give us the best optimum outward. Maybe. I'm just thinking aloud. So sorry for being too ambitious. And it the was good to be ambitious, but, yeah, the talking about it certainly would be the great. Thank you. Thank you. David. David Lumberger. This kind of was just brought up. It is unnecessarily difficult to find the set of current RFCs relevant to some specific topic.

So I've, Again, I think the tools team is looking into making IFCs better searchable through various techniques. And and so this is an ongoing sort of effort. In the meantime, I'm gonna plug what's it called rfc. FYI, which is not a tool seed project not Nottingham's little search engine. That is actually quite good.

That is really sort of a precursor to then us having automatic language translation then on the back of that as well for people to be able to use that. It is our understanding from the data that it is the verbal side of things that is the the biggest issue for people. And the the next issue then is writing English to to participate in a list.

One question, like the the dispatch at the beginning of the meeting on a Monday for the plenary. From there, I can learn a lot of things and know, okay. Something will be risk along the way. So the thing is I'm asking, is the similar thing can be applied to the that meeting. I know that meeting is not, official one. But there are so many set meetings along the 5 days. And then Hope, maybe the IHG can consider to put a similar session for the same meeting organizer to give, like, 5 to 10 minutes to introduce in a plenary such that, you know, participant can arrange their timeline. Thank you. So one function if the if the intent is a 5 minute pitch on work that is potentially in a working group or a new start that might be a candidate for the side meeting. Might sound good for hot RFC, which is already happening every Sunday night everyone gets a 5 minute pitch. Yep. And and on on the topic of site meetings, right, so we the the IETF slash ISG will make these rooms available for the community to have meetings on topics basically, if they're choosing.

One of the reasons is that that would make them for especially remote very indistinguishable from actual official IETF sessions unless we, like, completely brand media go differently. So so it it is sort of ongoing discussion and optimization cycle of of how much resources we put towards, allowing side meetings to be successful and while while still making clear that they're not part of your official IETF process in any way. we And and so we're we're taking suggestions. Right? If we if we can tweak things, then for example, provide the meeting hours now, which we didn't for, we let people set up their own conferencing systems. So so there are things that we're trying to improve, but we also wanna make it very clear that site things are not official. And so there's certain things we hesitant to provide for that reason.
