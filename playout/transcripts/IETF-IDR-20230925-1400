    "text": "go ahead hi Susan so I was just going to the fsb2 and the list of actions and it is going quickly going over the list it looks like at least there are like four actions so that can be folded into the mnh draft which is uh also in that option queue so if we Implement mnh for any address family then this redirect ipv4 redirect IPv6 um redirect to the indirection ID and the MPS level actions all of this can be achieved using their manage including the color resolution so that's just uh yes and I think all of it can be I don't think we have thank you for the comment Jeff anymore with Kelly Raj okay Jeff your turn okay a few things but uh hitting a reverse item as Kylie Roger brought it up so I'm not sure the multi-deck stop is probably the right consideration for firewall actions because I think what you're going to find uh happens as the flow spec stuff expands especially as the other use cases that have been on the table for where I'll move out there's a lot of types of things that are very intrusive and not really appropriate for IP routing but a perfectly appropriate firewall type actions so well certainly could have that as a discussions multi Next Top I think of contamining the use cases might be a challenging piece of discussion um moving through other discussion points that happened at that meeting at ietf last that Sue was mentioning um one sort of critical point is you know white communities is listed here as a potential piece of the solution space what we're looking at I think feature wise that we need autoflow spec V2 is more about how do you take sets of actions that need to be bundled together and allow them to be number one grouped"
