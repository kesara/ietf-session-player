    "text": "actually somewhat better results than if they were in all different queues so it\u0027s a cute idea feel free to look at it we have had a credit-based shaper for some time it is similar to the usual shaper you see in IETF the the only the the basic difference is that the max burst size falls out of the other parameter it has only one parameter which is bandwidth that you want to output and the max burst falls out of that and it\u0027s computable from that but it\u0027s basically familiar to what the sort of things you are used to this diagram shows how it\u0027s used it shows two of our typical mechanisms you have up to eight queues you don\u0027t have to have a queues of course you have update queues some of them may be running a weighted fair queuing algorithm some of them may be shaped with one of these shapers that could be the asynchronous traffic shaper I was talking about the minute ago it could be this traffic shaper well sort of actually that supplies at a higher level sorry but you\u0027ll notice the numbers there are the layer two priority values that\u0027s of course in a bridge what you\u0027re theoretically used to select the queue as we all implement that can be anything that you use to select the queue but you\u0027ll notice priorities 2 \u0026 3 which are the two priorities that we\u0027re running these shapers on are at the far right that\u0027s because they have precedence over priority 7 the priority layer 2 priority rdf diffserv code point whatever is used to select the class of service that doesn\u0027t mean that priority 7 is ahead of everything else if you\u0027re doing shaping the shaper the shaped views go out before priority 7 because otherwise they don\u0027t work and one of the nice things about any of these shapers is that having shaped the highest priority queues that gives you a guaranteed worst case latency for priority 7 and you can adjust that so the priority 7 does get out the other method that we use which is not based on shaping is based on schedulers 802 dot one qbv which is now a standard it\u0027s now a published standard in fact I think it\u0027s been six months so it\u0027s freely available from I Triple E you don\u0027t have to pay for it anymore what we have is below the eight queues "

    "text": "we have a row of gates and these gates are controlled by a schedule and basically every gate is either 0 or 1 open or closed the way we think about the way we\u0027re talking about this diagram here is that every queue has a bit that says I have something I\u0027m not empty that signal comes down weighted fair queuing picks one of those to present down the path the shapers will say yes I understand you have something but it\u0027s not time to present it yet it\u0027s not your turn yet so these can be thought of as filtering the I have something to transmit these guys are coming through unfiltered the time gates are open and closed if it\u0027s 0 the fact that you have something to transmit doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s one you\u0027re allowed to pass through the fact that you have something to transmit then priority selection starts at the right and picks the first one that it sees starting at the right that\u0027s the one that gets selected for transmission and that\u0027s the one you pick a packet from to transmit these gates allow you to do all sorts of things I can say only this queue gets to go at this time only this queue gets to go at this other time I can have critical functions I transmit them at this time I don\u0027t transmit them at this time I can reserve one of these queues for a particular flow say at this moment I want to transmit from that flow so that I can get essentially zero latency variation I can say enable one thing that a lot of people have said oh but this doesn\u0027t allow yes it does allow for this I can say the only queues that are allowed to go are this one critical queue and all of the priority queues and the critical queue of course is higher priority than the normal best effort queues which means that if I have a critical packet it will go if I don\u0027t have a critical packet then one of the best effort packets will take its place so you get a lot of flexibility with this schedule the schedule operates on a nanosecond basis and it\u0027s supposed to be time synchronized so that it stays pretty close with all of the other device all the other relayed nodes relay nodes queues you can use the output scheduler to control latency to nanosecond precision if your implementation is that accurate it allows for implementations of whatever accuracy you out but clearly with only a few queues it\u0027s not trivial to isolate particular streams or particular packets if you only have eight queues if you can\u0027t figure out what to do with that you\u0027re not too bright how to improve that other uses we can use that to time "

    "text": "share a link or a network we can use it for cyclic queuing and forwarding what is cyclic queuing and forwarding I\u0027m glad you asked another way of achieving fixed guaranteed into end latency is this we use these various techniques in combination in this example I\u0027m using in this example I\u0027m using Q\u0027s 2 \u0026 3 as a pair Q\u0027s 4 \u0026 5 is appearing I run the time schedule to say alternately let\u0027s just talk about one pair alternately 4 or 5 is enabled never both and I swap them back and forth while 4 \u0026 5 were enabled also the best efforts are also enabled so if I don\u0027t have any critical traffic\u0027s the best effort gets to go through what I do is I synchronize all the relay nodes and each node the critical traffic is double buffered norm just 10 minutes until the end of the session ok so and what I\u0027m doing is I\u0027m filling one buffer while I drain the other buffer every packet spends one cycle time sitting and then gets transmitted so my end-to-end latency is the cycle time times the number of hops it\u0027s that\u0027s another technique we have that doesn\u0027t involve shapers next is transmission preemption ok so the way preemption works is we\u0027ve got traffic that\u0027s Express traffic and we\u0027ve got traffic that\u0027s identified as preemptable traffic and this is per hop so it\u0027s not like IP fragmentation basically you may stop transmitting a preemptable frame while you transmit some Express frames and then you\u0027ll pick up transmission of it and the Mac will basically hold on to the frame until it\u0027s got the whole frame so the only thing that comes - and out of the max in this case is whole frames so the schedule traffic is like rocks in the transmission time it\u0027s in moveable now you\u0027d like to use as much of the rest of the time as you can to transmit efficiently the other traffic the traditional traffic if if you didn\u0027t have preemption basically what you\u0027d have is what you see in this figure which is okay I\u0027ve transmitted packet one I would like to transmit - "
