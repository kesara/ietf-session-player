So we have a couple of those And then some discussions of other things that are on the agenda we're gonna talk about time tag. We're gonna talk about Dns in sea and we're gonna talk about Cd l two point o, which is now a set of documents that Kirsten will kirsten in the cars will regal us with.

If for some reason, encoding ins sea is not possible or even if the civil format might in some cases be actually larger.

And some of them really are not about two point zero at all, but just doing fixes and additions to what we have in. So the first one is small draft, up to eighty six ten gram. I have no idea why wrote eighty six then let's see to do. Okay. Sorry. Make your life being sorta. And this fixes three things it allows empty files, which doesn't make sense for cd one, but it's pretty important to get city two going, so a little bit of shading shades of facility to are India. It provides non literal tags that was something we didn't understand there we to the original version of City that people would want to compute with tags and dino know can. With this edition. And there are also some router on eighty six ten, and we took the opportunity to fix those. So the the main result of all this is that the Ab and f changes?

So I think the legacy tool does not put on tanks yet why is the newer tool it does. So that's that's the implementation. Stitches. The second document is one of the documents we have already done once. So we found the need for various control operators, control operations are the defined extension point, And we put a number of them in Our c ninety one sixty five. So this is kind of part of base city now. And this is just another set I come to to what we added. In a minute, but it's really mostly about data formatting. Because... Yeah. We often carry things around in hours see documents that that are encoded in a different way and it's important to to able to say that. So these are pretty simple, but talking a little bigger is what what I call Two point zero. Which is the... Module it was structure. So I believe we can be completely done shipping to with the grammar fixes and the control operators. Before service francisco school? That might be a little bit harder to achieve with the modular structure. The module structure has the advantage that everything that is in the draft is already implemented so you can play with that.

And then there are other things which I Am calling City two point five. Now because we are probably not going to complete them this year. And that is in particular section three of the Cd two draft. Which briefly can be called annotations. So the ability to put additional information into models. That can be used by users of the decode Data item or json data item. To trigger some processing. And some of that processing may actually be Cda processing and some of that may application That is of course, something where we you immediately get the whole kitchen thing in in in the way of proposals that that we could do. So we will have to to maintain some restraint. But there there are examples for that in the freezer documents that that you might want to look at that. So then there are a few more documents.

There's no russia the important thing is it's it's documented in some place where people can ref. The second draft is a number of models for existing hours? That helps us because of the It provides models we can use in other documents. So if we don't want to reinvent, I would or something like that. We now have a a bottle for order. Then there are proposals for having some little roots in c some some application specific networks. So we just talked about the notation the address and is a different language from diagnostic segmentation even though they often confused but because they look so similar. The question is what what do we need in terms of application? Little some of that functionality is actually already provided by the operators and we should try to find do we need anything there?

There is an recording operator for decimal numbers. So you can describe the number in Citadel l and then say, this a text string that has this number in it. The same thing with Json values so you can describe something using City that turns into Json and carried it around as the text extreme. There is an operator for building text from array of components which is sometimes useful And finally, the operators we have for general cb data items dot c and dot zero six.

I no idea whether that's a good syntax We cannot use the the usual bracket syntax that is used in in certain programming languages because records mean something and and sit that.

So the Pizza size is an unsigned integer and it has a default value, which is thirty five inches. We have default values in, but these are really weird. So this would be the real thing. Another example of would be core occurrence friends, so we have a data structure that has two related data items and there are some constraints, for instance, the the time out for other session needs to be Let's than the time out for session. And right now there's no way to say this. And with the annotation mechanism we would have a way to to appoint to that session over there. And extract the number I come to how to do this in a second.

That is known as Json Path? That was never standardized and and we set up a working group a couple of is ago to finally do this. And the the document is kind of done. And just going into working a blast call very very soon probably right after the just So that might actually be a basis because the Json"

Like, which can do both and there has been a recent proposal for a sea path that I haven't looked at and did her because of Kim came in right before the. But we might learn something from that as well. So my assumption is that we will do something like a zero parts in the context of the Cd two point five core current constraint. Activity. And Finally, a few steps between two point zero and two point five might be cross universe references for instance. Pointing to an registry and saying C algorithm is the set of all integers that are in the video a column of the algorithms sub of the c registry. So, you know, maybe we should write escalated. I don't know. So right now, we we would have to write this pause Is telling us that this is not a stable end of maybe by the time we do this, we will have a stable interface. They told me that they you want to to solve this twenty twenty three. What if the value can be an integer or string some were This is possible. There yes. An impact on this syntax? Well, this this is str. Right? So of course you could word spring. But the hard part of course is converting the the textual information that in the end is in the registry into the data model that you want to have.

We probably want do with a and f But... Yeah, that that's the small matter of it's development upon. Done Okay. Do we have any questions or discussion about any of this Okay. I guess not. So we have a few things we need to run through adoption of first back on slide four here. It is the Ed literal to what's what's up there is do we want adopt the literal draft and just get that through? So is that is that your plan, Carson? Do that. Does anyone object to taking that path to adopting the Ed literal draft and and just pushing that through quickly. Failed mention that this is implemented in the civil diagnostic. Yes. So I see no objections. We'll take that and confirm it on the list. Slide seven. So we have it bang up. We have these three. You"

Any objections to any discussion of these or objections to adopting them. And I see none. So we'll again take that to the list and make sure that we're ready. Wait. Alexander. I hesitate a bit, but I would just wanted to double check. About the difference between import and include because as a programmer when I see one of those words, they been sort of the same thing in my mind. And somebody knew coming into this context would they be able to differentiate what one term means and what the other means. That... Criminal no. Perhaps I have to learn that like, with most things. And do you really think this distinction is necessary. What would happen if you only just one term. The distinction is not necessary. You could get by in clearly with import. The problem is that there is a class of errors that you are then likely to make And it's better if you have these errors caught by using include So in include just pulls in more And the the result that the internal mechanism in in this see a processor that compares multiple definitions of the same thing. Make sure they are all the same that that mechanism triggered, and you you you can make sure that parts of your specification consistent. That's why it's good to have something like include. Import never use a second definition of of the same thing. So that's the main difference."

One other nice aspect of input is that it's not possible to make a decision group which include doesn't issue. Okay. So we've got we'll be posting a couple of messages to the list about the adoption to confirm that that's good. Chris le, did you wanna say anything about your comment yet. Go ahead. Yeah. Sure. We One of the things I want to make sure to keep in mind when we're looking at modules is the ability to import and or include from documents that are not necessarily Rf. Cbd is useful for defining structures in a variety of places. So we wanna make sure that that That is at least as useful as what we see with, like, the import from, you know, Ninety ninety or what number is. Yeah. The the the current definition cheat a little bit on this So the the thing to the right of an input is a name and how that name is mapped into something is defined by the tool So City just takes an environment variable that looks like Uni pulse Plus. And checks whether the file is is in one of these positions."

If you are working with a draft, you would make sure that the recent copy of that draft lies around in your file system at a place that referenced in this Uni pass. And you would get the right draft, but it's it's really too hard we found out to to specify what version exactly you want to have because if if a draft is moving forward and just saying other draft and so on the the only real way you can get a specification that doesn't break everyone every time anyone moves is to put those files into a directory on your file system that is And I don't expect that we will be able to do this in the language. But I I would would love to learn about good ways to do this. Okay. Packaging. Yeah. I I'm gonna... I'll I'll I'll continue to red rep with these thoughts in mind and can discuss it as the work progresses. But This is all going in good directions. Thank you. Yes. So one thing that that I actually do is I zinc the whole set of internet drafts. That are only about two thousand of twelve so that. That's not not a big collection. And that is one of the directories that is in the the pass. Okay. We have one more thing we need to deal with before we wrap up getting the bi meeting schedule going. I've"

So be looking out for a message on that and check your calendars. And with that, we're at the top of the hour, Christian, anything from you? No. Just thanks for everyone presenting and participating. Yes, thanks And christian, thanks for sorting out things while I was having meetup c problem. That was quite weird. So thanks everybody for coming, and we will see you on the nineteenth of April online and on the mailing list."
