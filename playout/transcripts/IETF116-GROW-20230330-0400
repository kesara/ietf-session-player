We added an example because things got a little bit you know, let's say, complicated, so it was good and know, whether an example, thanks to Luke Hendrix for Having contributed that. Process the old feedback, so there is other moment no outstanding feedback. But Next slide, please. There are at least you know a couple of important decisions to take. Right? So First one was already taken and essentially, we moved the route monitoring to be kind of a copy. Of the root mirroring message. So we put the Bg p messaging into a Pd while we did that, for. Two reasons. The original one is that there was a kind of criticism to the fact that in the Tl that are following the Bg message. There could be things that are useful in order to pass the Bg method or that you may want before the Bg message. And so, you know, the fact that even know, the Bg message had to be the first thing in the message because it goes peer heater than the Bg message and then the tl was felt a little bit cumbersome. And so following that, let's say, we move to the Bg Pd into Tl, which is exactly what happens in the route mirroring message. Right? So we are being consistent we can say that we are not inventing a new protocol. We are not inventing a new solution. We are just copying a solution that works. And we are, you know, adapting it to to the root monitoring message. But there are two more items that require attention. So one is that the draft introduces something called the stat parsing seeing"

For example, if you have a ad park, in the Bg message either you move it from the peer up message or... Yeah. You at the moment, you cannot it Right? You don't have a flag. So what happened there is that people said like, oh, I don't like to have you know, this kind of stateless parsing stuff into At tl, the right place to put them is in in the in the flags, right, as part of the pure. And I totally agree with that. We have already useful information there. The only real thing that is missing there is the app path. So I think that what should happen in the revision of the document or less somebody really likes this solution is to remove this Tl from this draft and maybe have another draft where we defined the ad part flag. In the header. But a you. And then this is a second item which is maybe a little bit the more tricky. So I'm looking also at the chair here. To, you know, have an opinion on this. Right? So at the moment, what happens is that we define as part of this draft. We bump the version to Version four. Why? Because essentially like what we are doing in this draft is not back compatible because you can have a Tl and a defensive collector may reject the root monitoring message because it expects that there are no Tl. Okay? So there are there are being always to path forward for this. Right? So one is that you make a new message type, I don't know."

Maybe some text could be added like you know, that bump in version that you have only one copy of the truth. Right? So it's not that you say, oh, yeah. I supported the root monitoring message but not the extended route monitoring message. And this is it's maybe a simple draft, but it's key in making the protocol ex and on par with other telemetry protocols. Right? So I define this choice. But in the end for me, I mean, if people like in a different way, week to go. So at the moment, it's just I received feedback of some people that like to go in the other direction. Does the chair have opinion on that. A strong opinion on that or how do we handle this? You can always wake me up for an opinion. Yeah. Anything. I think this is a matter of offers understanding that there is a cost associated with bumping a version number. So to what the degree you want to keep first and free messages around. And I think it's it will be Up to your understanding of how is the ecosystem shaped, are the other implementations you are aware of fine with bumping the version, do they have plans to incorporate support for that.

But once you have that sort of thing that item three, once you got annotated and have the thing that to keep. Is how do you represent it in the fashion that is actually useful? Because, you know, I tell you that, know, you've gotten in your import clause, you know, into the third set of no things in the chain. That is now, you know, seven terms down that is no met... Failing the match the prefix list and it's taking a reject action Sure. I could have an entire stack trace of this, but do you want basically, a Internet routes worth of rejects worth of stack traces eating your memory in your bit. The answer is probably not. So These things are all doable. But they're costly. What I'd actually suggest instead is that it's actually far more productive to just simply note that something is rejected did have simple scalar reasons as, you know, we've been discussed now registry of things are the common motivations of why something has failed and some of these can be system local catalogs. You just have to figure out a way to exchange the catalog. That still state you're gonna burn to hold on to this, but you at please make the choices as an implement you do this or not. But the second piece of this is that the implementations are capable of know producing this type of information, it'd be nice to have some way maybe through, like you know, a net camp operations say test policy, this exact route, and let it give you in a fe stack return rather than have maintained the state for it."

But I would obviously like the environment in which they operate to be as similar to the production network as possible I wouldn't want some massive code path to be activated only at test time. So I think my happy medium for this would be roughly what router at Ru described. But in addition to a kind of a scale of value at final action time, a scalar for every kind of policy fall through. So like a root map continues statement also has an integer and then I can use that as my trace through the through the policy. Mh. Embed you're you're bright cookie? I suspect if you thought about how many bits it would take to actually represent the state that you're looking for, good find that your scaler is actually a very very big bit string. That's okay. Because then I can hang on it in my tests and not in my not in the production network. Go why you rip. And and and part of the problem we're discussing here. This is I'm affecting B. If you're going to actually do this, it has to be held onto to minimally until the things been emitted in mp so this is a overhead that you're taking and back pressure for serving the stuff can cause you know, this memory to stack. Yeah. No. I. Now that would be that would be a question of tuning where I apply those traces. The the the nightmare scenario for us is we have some very effective kind of second tier filter that's catching everything. And we think that it's being caught further up the chain and it's not. Yep.

So I'm going to explain why it's going to be very quick. The draft is very short. I hope not two controversial. I'm going to really quickly explain why we're doing this then the two options that we listing and then we'll what we're doing with this. So slide. So nineteen sixty nine provides a view the creep, which is fine. But the clear address field is zero is set two zero. Found it a bit unfortunate because that means that you know which us was installed, but you don't know who gave you that person. And the field is there ready to be used but it's nineteen sixty and it says it must be zero. So when you're digging in your data, well do you have to do additional work to where this pass was coming from and it's getting a bit messy and when you are doing multiple in personnel scenario, which get even more because you lose the at bus When you have passed Etcetera it's getting bit cumbersome. And so in the implementation we've been working on, the information is just right there. It was actually additional work to set the field two the we we are reusing code that was having it. Right? So we would like to provide this information for those implementations that are okay to provide this to us on this please.

If you don't like it, then we could also use the Tl v and booking. Register a new T to actually provide this information so that we wouldn't not know about this Tv would just... I mean, not do anything with it and that's it. Suddenly know it, and we would not have any issue. Next slide Visa. Yep. So the two options are quite easy. I prefer option one. So the fact of using clear because it's already there. And so it's quite aligned with what we do in not in and rebuild approaches so why not? I will let you guys decide. We're okay to implement any of the any of the option in implementation we're using the option one, but It's not yet. Committed. Another the action item we have on the draft is we forgot to book a value flag to say that whether of the period address is v six or before. As it's not the same set of as the one for our been so that would be an item on the Velocity if we actually do this.

It's it's the reason why I'm standing here because not not speaking of a very this an extremely large customer running some car's problems already due to different bugs on this matter. You're going to find that this v thing makes this not a possible feature. You know for exactly the reasons you're thinking you know, things are already expecting the flags to behave a certain way. So if you're if you were looking to do some use of generic behaviors, probably not necessarily helpful. The low crib is part of the Pure app already sends optional Tl tl for the grip name. Sorry. I did not pass that. Can you... So as part of the look real that view. Being sent initially, You know, it goes into pure upstate. And says the message related to that. One of the optional Tl that go out as part of that is already a rib name. So some people are already expecting this name of the table to be sent as part of sessions, so they can identify things. It's not part of every message is you're wanting it be. But at the very least it means that during the your up message, you could include a local address as a system identifier so that you can then further demo multiplex the individual records. So have a attention here what you can do is for free add an additional Tl for Pure up. Through station that's receiving must keep track of this and is this part of installing the database, but stations already having to keep this sort of rolling state per connection in anyway.

So it depends on the implementation that you have, but we have it right there and when we create the message, that's information. Right? We're consuming in the space on the wire because the fifty there empty. And at all we are saying is if your implementation, Is can do with at no cost, Just enabled it. And give the...

Let's just because that's offline because I'm not sure I'm... Okay. We see that. Obviously, this is for a network to cooperate a very interesting to understand from which this pass has been learned from and just one comment basically, if it would not be part of the help monitoring message, Then basically, we are just shifting the problem downwards because we need to c the data and I think it not an additional overhead on the message itself. Thanks. That's why you were doing this. And yeah. Yeah. Thanks for confirm. There is clearly another issue that we have is that without knowing the clear address, you us to actually rewrite the past Id because you're talking about past that you it from multiple peers, we have their own Id space.

And it doesn't have strong language that the receiver must confirm the the field is little zeros? It it basically says ignore. So that means in the pure header right now, implementations in the case of Ip six are sending sixteen bytes worth from zeros in the case of ip four. Four bytes? Yeah. The the unfortunate. That so how did this situation come to be. I'm asking you? I think that's some implementation where a bit struggling getting that information at the while they're generating the message and so they got scared and they decided to have it busy. That's my guess, right? For us, on our implementation, it was work to it to zero instead of the. So just the. Right?

It's a very small stupid detail, but this is what has already tripped up As publicly as bug, you find Jennifer's implementation changes your income this one do what? Yeah.

Unfortunately, the second and the problem is if you're expecting a ninety sixty nine type behavior, know, sure you could look for this new bit, but the thing that announces in Bm p to that you have structural changes is it's a new version number.
