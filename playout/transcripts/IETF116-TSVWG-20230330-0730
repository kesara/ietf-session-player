You haven't him please read it, We have note takers again, we need review for working group drafts. And this is our agenda for today. First magnets school talk about less protection for, then we have three talks by Michael and one one talk by Lewis. Any agenda batch? Then this is what we are gonna do. We'll also try to squeeze in John's talk. Mh. Hello. Yeah. So. Hello, everyone. Magnus is Best. Something hour. The other, price and cloud your. So I'm here to talk about the detail security for p.

So the background here was really about I mean, just been a while since three people requested that I address the message size limitations in C is six to three. Which is detail over ct. The working group adopted this details of biz graph to address this issue. During the fall, they found some security concerns with Offers as well as realized some around security assumption from our perspective. Situation is still. Fifty people still need a solution that support this larger isis. Meet some modern security requirements and support long lived Associations. And to note, there's two sets of declarations. Form the detail of Recipe and the detail innocent piece drops So if you can review those next slide. So some of the shallow we had with Don't do that. Help me take adjusted still So So in the development and work with retailers over we had several issues we seen there. Is requirements on the details implementations. Several use that aren't dot common, for example, large details record exercises beyond normal ip packet sizes. Also, the usage of detailed connection Ids. We also had the interesting re keying in interacting with the independent message size fragmentation and their placement in receivables, which requires quite advanced striking"

And that in itself has some interesting there's two when it comes to replay, we'll maybe coming late, but it's basically saying that those Chunks that doesn't have sequence numbers? You can't determine if the plate or not if coming in independent packet. So So You also are depend on update bureau if you're gonna keep on using details over recipe, So as a solution, So let's go to next slide. So that's another lesson from Sd or we have is and feel like from a general secured perspective is that when you and embed mechanism that's valley Niche in some sense from an active perspective in usage it and not that much used you you have a problem that maybe it's lots you don't see when their security issues etcetera. So we really want to look into trying to ensure here with with the forward that we have better way of integrating security protocol that is well known maintained and used individually, insufficient numbers, etcetera so that it's any security issues are found, etcetera? So that's why we try to define and make it is that uses this protocol much as this. Basically us it explain how you use the protocol to protect the data we want to protect in.

Which uses something call the protection engine indian which is based maybe define one for detail list. But you could define other protection based on other secured the mechanism one to. And this changes so that works on applying security protection on Shu in individual packet? So it's very similar in that self for message to be off from what they protect. Except that we don't have Yeah. That's. So And because we defined multiple text engine we also need to specify a little bit about you can negotiate it, but we'll come to that. So next slide. So the general integration to the stack is is practically to depicted here. So m You have a protection engine? Which is is is have to deal with packets, protecting them it's it's one for one. But in the S stack, you have the crypto handler, which basically calls to detection and, hey. Protector protect each package. And then you have to have some interactions with how you get key management. The current drop uses let's the protection indian basically emits crypto chunks its own zone. I'll come back to that with some discussion we had on list. And why you might want to change this, but And and then you also the applications saying the protocol here.

When it comes to establishing this, you basically normal the four by handshake And in the initial you include to saying on on crypto shock support, and then you list all deep text support. And then the peer response with the act indicating which of those it chooses, which is also to self supports. And then you conclude the handshake with a c. Then you need to establish show that you are protected and read. So that means running any key management establishment set. And that's why you going into this protection pending state. In this protection pending stage, you're still not allowed to send any data for the Ul p. And instead you just doing handshakes, etcetera. And when you manage the handshake, you go into the protective state, And then you do one more thing here, which is sending what's called a p ball shank. Over the protected channel you established. So basically in the secure inside of security, you're sending this and that lists what protection and you were offering. And support. So that's to ensure that you can't easy downgrade attacks? So this downgrade protection is a strong as your secured Say that you actually established, but it's So if you are really, really weak secured to make guess you could could be fooled, but otherwise, this is also been used for example in in tls, etcetera for similar protection.

We use replay protection And one effect of this is that the details record sequence number will be strict Packet transmission sequence order, So as Stack sends back, that's the sequence number where we have. Which makes replay etcetera easy to deal with? The detail centric is performed in initial in detection. Pending by having details packet the details message for Handshake into crypto chunks and send them in assisted it the p. And in that the current draft description, it's gonna be tell that possible of detailed messages. This have some interaction with the Be multi homing. So for normal date that is yes how to minus the p, but for handshake We are kind of dependent that your current path works. Otherwise, it would fail and didn't pay for this route. In detail because we we mostly been using for the short heartbeat interval no more than two seconds, which means that dealership handshake shouldn't time out. But... Yeah. This is one thing we're discussed. I think going forward, heavy maybe need to look into more changing. When you do reading, you basically have send doing an ongoing session you have decide now, I want a new connection and then you send this as new crypto chunks to the handshake in parallel with the existing session as it's continue to work. When you establish it You can just switch over to that connection id details connection Id as the one that used for protecting the packet. Then you could just wait if few want and then you can close down the old one. Which is significant improvement"

Here you would know that basically, a short timer is sufficient to ensure that you don't have a problem. And even if you would drop it a little bit too soon. It would only be mean that packets registered lost. And not result in failure. Ask for detail. Next slide, So this was something Michael T brought up in discussion about these handshake packets. So alternative here, which I think we need to think a bit more about, but I I want to it's it's it's interesting enough that were bring up, but that's basically helping that handshake message would go through the stack can be sent data touch chunks. While the packet protection would still be on the side between the Protection Indian and the crypto trunk handler And the same Api between the And the telus and would still need exist when it comes to this basic. Establishment or certificates on these things. The downside c is that state management which was very clear when it was established stops and data. Mechanic becomes a little bit more complicated with this, because you need to allow the the protection engines indians to send through the stack, but not the P. So Therefore, you probably want different Apis between the you be in the Stack at one so that you can keep those separated cleanly. So And maybe then also needs to have to be able to turn off the details. You say. I'm saying that it should be turned off that would be probably"

So another of Circumstances is about the implementation and the key possibility to implement this. It's... Yes. The kernel part of this of how you're dealing with the current ridiculous detail stuck interaction is is Yes, it's not ideal. But it's two simplifies. I think it's three nice things and it does keeping this separation clean as we think we can get it down. So I do you do kernels use space call for each packet and get the packet back after protected it and continue processing. Or you have to do some embedding or loading of the details record protection or something like that into the kernel. But So basically, you can split your retailers stack into two parts. One, which is basically crypto processing and this has been done for tls there's Tls some, etcetera dust this in the lower layers in the kernel space compared to the other and and leaves the hand shaking mechanism been used that. And from our perspective, we aren't specific about this Yes. You're gonna have to have some of these Apis which Jarvis indicates. But That's not necessarily use that we define them from our perspective. I know that Michael is not administrative enough and he can hopefully speak on that myself, but Yeah.

So Benefits of detailed is really It encrypt all of the chunks. You get improved protection S chunks that doesn't have sequence numbers cost of the detail replay protection window. Mechanism it is much more robust. And you have less need for tracking things. Use specified detail as one point two and point point three as defined, and you can negotiate which of the amount. And your detail stack dependencies has been significantly reduced. So that's the cease benefits. So And basically question, I think for the group is which direction we should go here. If you should go towards details and abandon them, the detail is over it be for now. So Oh, michael. Yes. So my main my let the main to I have with with this solution is that Right now, I haven't understood how to implement this. Carlos. And with the with the kernel implementation, in an appropriate way.

You might need to serial things and that might be a problem I've that's where I'm not sure. It's it's just not doing the handshake get down the crypto parameters and you done this helps for sending and receiving until you get to Detailed messages again. Conceptually, as I said, this looks like running S p over D, just with the packet format that not the whole lcd p packet goes into the detail payload. But only the list of chunk goes in the S p payload then you do your details processing prep the crypto Junk had a prep. And if I to get out. There are some limitations like you can't do restart and think you can't do dynamic configuration. So there are features on Cd p. Okay. I I Let me if the... If the appear in restarts, he has no state anymore. So he says another handshake message in the established state and you say in the established state, you accept only crypto chunks. Haven't And the other one with A that when you get an ace packet you get a come head an auth chunk and contract at the Es contains an Ip address you need to look up the association. So you would need to know this address, Look up the association, then you have the key material to decrypt it and that's too late.

You had to key somewhere stored and and you have Because I mean, the pain in the initial session is between basically Ss association has identified v tag. And which set of keys it is based on the counter. Which we only send last to bits up. So that identify which keys I used to protect each packet. Yeah.

But there is two requirements. First of all, you need the kind of third party I coming for about the signal the two side, And if the two side the same time just seamlessly, do the same thing. That means if the Udp timeout is one hundred and twenty seconds, Within that window, they need to shoot the fact to the each other at the same time. If you miss the window, the connection will fail. So need to coordinate at the same time. So very difficult to tcp to work because you are already password too kind of. And Tcp saying is very complicated. Right? You know that therefore, Tcp only doesn't work. Only Udp will work actually so this is why you see that a lot of the voice, whatever, they charge using Udp. To punch through. So the solution right now is missing is how to make it work and it's for for situations. And then this kind of solution I'm going to pose is So something I need to work on the kind of and the the kind of method will be allowing not only Udp and also Tc can be run a syncing. I mean you'll be served port. Just like you do forwarding at your home gateway I think people use home gateway Wifi router. You know forwarding. Right? To experience it the same.

Will go to the net And she can pass over to the home Gateway or Lg or it does Lg then pass it to the Pc, your Pc, which hosting the surface so that one. So we win a punch hole. At the same time there's only one only one, will receive this for... Means along the chain only one for example, one or two for say, along the chain only will we have one device behind the Home Gateway or the Lg or gateway to receive its traffic. So we make sure that there's only kind of unity actually in this dishwasher. But there some consideration. I'm not going to explain this one in this slide because it be complicated will it after the demonstration. I give a demonstration first and you understand how it works and invest simple. Next slide please. This is a demonstration. Okay? Here does seeking net here"

    "text": "Actually, I use... I used my home kind of a router to simulate this work. You know need the out open source. Right? Then I use it rt to actually chain two devices One is simulation on that. The other one is similar a. Okay? The net with a function turned on cardiac ip, which is, if if this is off, every pack in the incoming information from the Internet all dropped whatever traffic, Unless the section table was built. Otherwise, doctor. But if the function is on, which I need this function which is stateless, actually, no state. Stateless. Right? Then this one allow some ports to be passing through under some conditions. Right? And then, here there's a new procedure in order to get this one is a stump procedure, then I will use some procedure here to tell demonstrate how it works in this case. So let's look at the Ip address. Okay. Just very simple one. From the from the left side is the one hundred sixty twenty dot hundred. And then... And then twenty dot one one Eleven, which is the when gateway when address for Algae with home Gateway, and then the cg net and then su that there's a ip address. Okay, which I mentioned here, but the port allocated to this particular the Ip address is one zero two four to one five five. The plot range are rotated for that one. It means there's one part range Be stick to one pipe address which allocated to the home Gateway. This is called allocations. Okay? But but in some cases, the only one port maybe because of the data implementation Right? Sometimes it's a range of the port. Sometimes it's only one or two ports Right? But, anyway, this method will works for either case. But here, just said example saying to how it works. Okay? It will. Just allocate care arrange. That means whenever traffic going out, it will see that randomly, which port is going out from this range one zero two four two zero five the spot"

    "text": "as a source spot. When he is just seeing that right? Whenever mapping it just to like that way, So there will be the example it will be a kind of a traffic. We randomly In example, it will be one zero three five is coming back. So I would illustrate how we worked in this case. First of all, the Pc one in this start of the the left hand side of diagram, will use a kind of procedures. What it does is that's the detect... What is my puppy Ip address? What kind of port I'm using right now. From the Ct perspective. So randomly, because this time is random, right, Between this range, one or three five in this example is being detected I won't you as available. Okay? I'm using. Then what the Lg is doing... I mean, sorry. The pc doing. Second step is, I send a P to be reserve the port in the Home gateway. So that if you see one zero three five this point. Send it week. Okay? Then now those Tv services allow. So the tricks with the this E etf on is whenever traffic sending from the Internet pc two from Internet on the right hand side, if it's send of a traffic with this puppy Ip address, and put one zero three five, This that will see, okay. This on, I will pass the traffic and and and modify the port zero three five and direct two the Home gateway, lg, rest of the gateway, And one three five using Up p already register. It will again forward to a Pc. See is a change afford the port. I mean, it understand. Right? That's afford one by one to the destinations. In this case, it your. Benefit of this one, there's no control playing in. Compared to Pcp there. You always have... We crossed or something of that this is not scalable."

    "text": "This one, actually depends on how you write the software, the done, And then I detect your ports. That's it So it's a scalable solution compared to the other called Pcb solutions. Next slide please. So this is a quick demo on how it works actually, I create this demo And then there's a video record as well, but with our scripts But here is very simple. I want a scripts here in the step one it execute process. Which detect my pop Ip address and then the port. The pop is beginning with fifty nine wrong. Fifty nine. Actually. But the port number is detected it one fit five. And then second need the second step in the this demo is it will request the home with algae Tcp one zero three five to me. And then And then start the surface. In this same server, this Server, I will actually this one of one of three five as a http server. Okay? I host of Here, And the same time, I we direct the surface using a up p to ask Lg to map the Ss ssh tool this pc. Well, So This is done. The index slide. Then using the address just for why that want, Ip address and the port number. We just tag you in the browser it works. It is not. It's not of a free. It's a number one or three five, but it will work actually okay. The host surface Tcp is Like say. And then if put in the kind of Ss x We have this part number one zero three seven and airport not the three five. This is this another port. In script I serve. One zero three seven is."

    "text": "Now I usually up Pc try to assess this this ip address And then this point it will actually get the section. Now this is all our. This service is similar to what people expecting today using normal Up with a Ip address. Okay. Next slide. Please. Okay. This is the kind of the algae european Pm p tables. You see it as a conversion. Right? In the top highlight when the red offs, how the pop being translated. Okay? One of fifty five becoming local ports. Actually. Next slide. So this is the last slide explaining about why I I I need to check, for example, If the public Ip address, one one zero two four. Is mapped to is the on the palestinian net and the will pass it to the algae and the positive Pc one in this example. One or two four. It's being. Forward one by one to that one. But this one or two four It's not only used by Pc one behind Home gateway. Gateway it's not used by them. Only by one one one pc. Any sections. Actually, pc one is one b behind the home gateway the Algae, they still can have share the same all outgoing connections. Just a chance. The one or two for this part is use for other session as well. Right? This is possible. Because cg network actually just map. Right? So this is not that for Pc warm. So therefore, it will be has a comm table created for that one. And then actually, I don't want teach this one. But the sense of this one is when xi see the packet incoming ring, in the check whether, there's an existing session table not being created. Based on... I mean, that kind of port number. If it is on of this one first,"

    "text": "Okay? If there's checking it's table afterwards, there's nothing no such actually inside here, it's a new Ip port. Right? Kind of a kind of combinations, the ground the sections and then put forward this one to one zero two four to the Pc arm. I mean, to the the the Lg in this case, right? Throughout not to log and that Beside Pc to to send the port. So this is the only checking here. So I think I'm run... I I'm running over a time, but And this is my last slice. Any questions? I think it's see. Right? Sorry for the I think our say, thank you over so much for the example. Work through. That's all helpful. I suggest we take questions on the list. And people can even review your talk here with the example to see what they think about this piece of work or whether they think this is something useful to contribute to So please turn the question to the list. Yes. Okay. Thank you very much for the presentation. And then we have a few minutes left for John. We are still trying to figure out how to get your slides on on the screen. But maybe maybe you can start talking alright. So Let me give you the title of the presentation, This was scheduled for the previous session it's media header extensions for wireless networks. So while we're bringing up the slide I will talk through the problem statement. Seven."

    "text": "So essentially, many media application require both low latency and high throughput And wireless networks on the other hand. Experience transient, channel quality drops, sometimes in the order of five to ten times. So when there is this huge drop of bandwidth. I mean what happens is that there's there qb buildup and it can essentially drop either in the tail or the head or whatever depending on what the scheduler uses. But essentially, those kind drops will result in poor quality for media because maybe it's a few packets of the iframe and so on. So this this is the problem that is being trying to solve here. So what we think is at l for s and the the whole end to end congestion control, can manage rate adjustment over the long term but for these very sharp drops in and trans drops over a very short time needs another mechanism where the network gets involved or we need a shorter condition control. Loop. Which is not so practical. So this has been studied by 3g g p p and when there is Rt t, they have proposed solutions where they read the header and then use that metadata to prioritize what to send it going to drop. For encrypted packets. There needs to be some method that I think we'll need the Idea of help So it's very similar to what they're doing for hard, but for encrypted packets. You know, there is no matter that can be right. I mean, no head. That can be right. There there are a few proposals in 3g, which looks at extending Gt, which is not such a good idea."

  {
    "startTime": "01:00:01",
    "text": "And a few others, but I think the solution should come in this space in in the idea. So our draft proposes you know, to basically give a few metadata data. So one or two of those are the priority or importance and the other one is a burst length. Using the priority the scheduler and the radio side can determine which group of packets to drop so that it doesn't drop you know, important packets or part of a frame and part of another frame and so on. And You know, so we propose a Udp option to be able to handle this. So basically, the importance and a burst length can also help... If if it's given ahead of time, the burst length can help the scheduler to reserve bandwidth with and resources for that expected medium So that's that's the idea. It's it's a little bit hard to explain with, but know, please have a look at the draft. We're open to suggestions on other in solutions. I think this is a space that it's preferable that the propose a solution or give some feedback on that rather than... Because it's something that the Have showed in not 3g that should be working on this. So please have a look at the draft and appreciate feedbacks additions, whether this should be done one way or another Thanks. Thank you, John. And sorry, we didn't manage to get your slides up they were. Not available on the data track and then we try the screen share and then or cut out. That's okay. I hope I'm able to convey the problem and I hope I can get some feedback. Thank you."
