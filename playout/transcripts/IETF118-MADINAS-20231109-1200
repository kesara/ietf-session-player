By the time we started already, And we are focusing on the layer 2 identifiers on how much information that might disclose and the efforts that are being done on trying to mitigate that. There are several projects in ATF and outside ATF trying to use randomized mechanisms to improve the privacy or mitigate the privacy concerns and the goals of this document is to basically the commander status of those different initiatives, keep, kind of a life repository for for those, especially for the mobile OSS, in terms of what they are doing current practices how they may have evolved.

I believe I made this comment some many meetings ago, But, so this needs to be rewritten before this is ready to go. Sure. I fully acknowledge that.

So we fixed that. But, you know, to me, there was a pretty much an editorial type of of change. Meanwhile, as you may remember, what this document was trying to do is to look into what we call the use cases and the framework around this RCM problem where when we say, my privacy is going to be compromised because they are going see my MAC address, well, who is day and what is my privacy? So we ended up defining a series of use cases that you see on the swing. For where the MAC address may be exposed to different types of actors and those actors may be human actors, you know, from your service provider"

Because of course, the solutions are going to be very reference, depending on where you are, ended up is where you're given a word where there is no, personal information on that tablet. The privacy exposure of, you know, RCM is completely different than you are an public airport, for example, with your own own phone, So, you know, that document has been going on for, now 2 years and a half. It's getting fairly stable. I I would like to underline 2 things. One is that's in the last section of this document section 7, we had studied to explore the, what we call, current solutions that is to say current direction that the industry has to mitigate the RCM problem. And then we concluded, a few sessions ago, I think three sessions ago, that this was not the document for this. Type of exploration, it would rather go into a BCP if there is a BCP, produced by this group, but this document should not have it. So we get that section 7 here as a reminder of, you know, that direction and I think the last step before by going to the final version will simply be to remove that section. We also had a section which is in 6.3 that we called, requirements And you may remember, we had a long series of requirements at the beginning and those requirements where essentially, the discussions we were having in this group about what we thought the solution requirements might be or also the work of the group, requirements might be so as the group worked, that section became partly obsolete, so many of these requirements were"

At And we know that some other groups, in the believe, for example, a to 11 BH and a to 11 BII do look into this problem into, you know, station disconnecting, reconnecting with a new MAC address or a session changing its MAC address within a single session. But also, requirement number 2 that we understand is that if the device needs to be recognized. It's identity, whatever the identity needs to be stable across in your MAC address changes. And of course, you know, different use cases, different environments, may have different different consequences. So this is the, the state of these documents. I'm very happy to, to have comments on questions. The, reflector has been fairly, quiet on this document for a while, which leads me to think that the document probably is reaching its its maturity. But I would love to to hear if anybody has, taken the time to read it and has any any comments on it today. Carlos? Yep. Carlos Bernardo, I had one question on the requirement number 3. I guess, at least in my understanding, probably that that could be rewritten a bit because to me, like, saying different use cases may result in different entity requirements is not a requirement per se. Right, would be something more like solutions, support, potentially different, needs or something like that. Right? Maybe some minor text, the change on that requirement may be used Alright. That makes sense. Thank you very much. I'll propose a change. And what was your next Yeah. So I'm putting myself in the queue.

Probably something more like just recommendations or or or or just practices, current practices, but not best current practices per se. And, if that is the case, I I I wonder if if the section 7 that originally was meant to go to a BCP could be kept as a as Nanex informational or something here.

A secondary requirement. One case come out of my brain is, it's called the catheter device noticed, like, a user tab video session in the 5 g system. And then you're going to have a ue with a Mac and there's some, devices connected through the, the UV, which have their own unique device MAC addresses.

So for that things, I try to read through your, requirement a second So any change of identity identity may result in real indication that here is, like, supposed to you have 5 tether devices to your hand side. Now the 5th one coming are you going to re authenticate the original one from hand side. You just, accept it? So this is some case. Thank you. I'm used kids. Alright. Yeah. Thank you, Eugene. That's a very interesting use case. You know, this requirement is is is not intended to be specific, in terms of practice, it's intended to to notice that if you lose the identity who's connecting, then necessarily you need to reestablish that connection. In 8 to 11, for example, they they distinguish the identity of the link from the agency of the device. And the envision, for example, that a device may provide a different MAC address but, you know, when saying that this new MAC address is connected to the same identity, whatever this identity is. So in the use case you're describing, I, you know, I don't think we should be you know, this deciding of any any any any practice, but the idea is that if you lose the understanding of who is selected, of course, necessarily service is going to be interrupted. I try to make my make myself more clear. It's just like nothing has been changed. You just get a 5th one. One additional, tailored device is connected. In that case, is that one going to affect your requirement the second? On this slide, It it doesn't look that way. Right? So I'm I'm not expecting the field you're you're talking about, but It seems from what you described that the device is still the same. But, you know, there is a, there's a new MAC address. Anyways, you know, in the connection that email address is tied to the same same design, did nothing changes. Does it? You you you know that feel better than I do."

Because in the yeah. Sorry. To make the simple, consider how to spot. So basically from your hand, device, iOS device, you enable your hotspot, something can connect this through your device, the And then those things will have their own unique MAC address. Well, Now I have called you a question now. Got your question. So in this case, it's the, I mean, that's, like, to Ron say, then that is that would just apply as IP device. Like, you're actually asking for from this cases, right, your hot hotspot, like, meaning you're you're using, like, a WiFi device, So in this case, your my file actually is layer free cutoff point. So then the authentication only happened to the Wi Fi. No cost, in the 5 g system, they is one PDU session type called the ethernet. Ethertab. So that means it's still layer 2. So the device behind the your, iOS device are using Mac to connect it toward the outside network. Still running layer 2.

With a limited number of authentication exchanges, indicating price leakage or possible privacy leakage across the race interface between the open roaming identity provider and the open roaming access provider.

And so with that in mind, the areas to capture now, authentication exchanges between different access network implementations and a wide range of production of learning identified this, given that open up open learning is and system that we need to, observe logs with real world credentials being authenticated to IDPs on access networks. So that's the that was the objectives. In terms of, the actual, process, we set up 4 separate, open roaming access networks. And you can see those described here. So they were they, included Cisco Cuplist, going to the radius functionality in Cisco hotspot connector, then we had, radiator access point going to the radiator proxy we have Cisco Meraki going to a cloud instance of rubsec proxy, And then we had, Magtech, which, is a a sort of averse standalone sort of AP and Nasdaq proxy all in 1.

So when we look at these, this class this class was starting with BIC and these other CUI example, These could all represent cached user identifiers, I guess, we don't know whether the access network was included in that cash because as I said, we it was difficult to test mobility events, from the hack of hackathon environment. So so, some key actions or considerations the robotics internet draft, obviously, that's focused on privacy leakage using chargeable user identifier, the question is is whether there should be sections on the username rewrite and use of class, and recommendations there as well. I guess, considerations for wireless broadband Alliance and open roaming, should they specify use of hash identifiers in access except unless the user has explicitly agreed to terms that permit sharing of permanent identifiers and obviously something to take up with wireless broadband Alliance. And my final slide, yep, thanks to all the hackathon participants. Obviously, it was a full weekend of looking at log capturing those and obviously the same list.

If you wouldn't mind, please. You you hit it. With the hash and unless the user has explicitly agreed, no, no, yet, they're unless the user has explicitly agreed to the terms of service. What we saw was in the authenticator we were using. That was the default option. And there was really no explicit agreement. There was the only pop up we got was when we chose to turn that off. And then it said, if you don't share this information. You likely you may not get the full service that you want, as opposed to truly being opted in to say I know that I will share my permanent information or or my my a permanent identifier with with the parties involved. So that that was one of the concerns because to your point, when we didn't check that option, we saw the you know, UUID, UUID type, CUI. The other thing I I would say is, Juan Carlos, I think you you started this off by saying, as part of the liaison statement, there was willingness to work with the knock in the future. I'll put it in the chat but, we have an email alias. We're not exactly like a typical working group.

But, obviously, those are items to follow-up with and to understand whether access network is being hashed and and whether the, users' UUID is being in those responses. Thanks. So I put myself in the queue and, well, just just to to bounce on on on on the comment, actually, I I had that follow-up similar to what Joe said I think, from the from the discoveries, which are actually very, very, very interesting. I see at least 3 different levels of actions that we can take. One of them is clearly on on the on the radius, recommendations, and I will let the, I guess, Alan will will get more in detail about that. There's another one on, the the commonality or how this is going to be used by WPA. Or whether there's going to be some a genius type of, deployments that, we can guarantee that beyond Radix, specifying how to use it, that WPA will actually say this is the way WBA is doing it, or if you sign to WBA, you, you are guaranteed that this is, this is the way you are treating your privacy.

Any kind of user agreement is political error. Radius won't touch that. Very true. I'll give a bit of background as to the interact and between username and COI in class. Just so, I think everyone's clear on what's going on. The original idea was username was your public identifier. Sometimes it was not quite what you wanted. So you could return a username in an access accept. And that was supposed to be sent back in accounting packets. So that was some username rewriting there. Then there was the realization that especially with beef and with anonymous odor identifiers, you wanted a user identifier which was public, but not tied to the particular user. You couldn't use username because that was already used for proxing. So CLI was added. And separately, class is really an opaque token that the IDP hands back the Visiting Network and it's supposed to be echoed back. And it's explicitly useless to everyone other than the IDP.

So I think what Joe may be seeing are some, you know, artifacts of that know, kind of earlier kind of a premise. So but I think it probably makes sense.

Because the Radix has been extended to care about not open roaming, but multiple roaming, So I would assume, I'm looking at you, I would love to get your feedback because I not I I know I reviewed the Radek chatter years ago and months ago, but Yes. There is explicitly an item in the current radically charter on best practices for roaming. And this could fall into that. I think that's the best way to move forward on this. So so let let me let me ask, Eric, before before you you leave the mic. Because there were a I'm I'm trying to to to make it as as simple as possible. It is not. I think we're finding a lot of things that there's potential extensions to to radius or a recommendations on how to use radius, there is, recommendations on on how to share or exchanging private information, And this is more on the implementation of the WBA profiles.

I think that's also that's probably outside the scope of radix. Some other things may be in scope like if you're identifier changes, in the middle of a session or your MAC address changes in the middle of a session. I would expect that to be a completely different session. See him and that gets into issues of network access. Which interacts with Radix.

Some of it could be in WBA as to how WBA wants their members to behave.

I mean, one of the another use case with, we we we can enforce I mean, sorry, we can foresee here is in case you, for, for, like, for, for the user who sign up for, permanent control for a particular device right, for a particular, service, or in the contract that we labeled, like, this is how we protect the, children, for example. And then, and then we will have application to make sure that when the"

It's just like that we went we wanna make sure that when the key safe connect to the home, home network. Then, which is also, in, under the same umbrella of the, of the contract. Just we wanna make sure that we can provide the same type of protection to the user, to the to the kids so that then we know that, okay, his parents designed to use, this protection for the kid and then he signed for this service, we'll be able to Okay. So then you're doing sort of eeps, essentially, epsemorepaca, e epaca, authentication to figure out who the user is, doing that. So Oh, we we can definitely do that from when they're room from the 5 g network challenge one we have is because the home when you connect to the home when when they bring, let's say, the key, bring the device back home. Usually, they would use the home WiFi first to connect to the home WiFi. When they connect to the home Wi Fi, they will use this, the SIM PSK? Oh, sorry. I'm not seeing. Sorry. They will use the WPA PSK 1st, so then we win this case because on the in in the new, like, rep, but the the one of my MAC address, we won't be able to identify the details anymore. See. Thank you. Cherry. Hey, Baba. I can't answer your question for so sorry about that, that person. Mentioned about, okay, you have your phone and then you are outside with the 5 g and come back and with Wi Fi. Actually, there's, some, kids already defined in 3 GBP about how going to work because, for the 5 g, you are going to have your, a 3 gb p access. Where we will come back to the room you can use a Wi Fi to access, but seeing is there another card announced with GPP W wireless interface. Means you're still going to go through some non street view access, but on the core network is going to through a GVP of the 5 g."

You are sharing the same core network, although the access part, it different. Why in the 3 gpt, why in the non Yeah. That is, the the value I think the proposal going to act. Thank you. Laurensically, I think you could, could use either WLAN to authenticate yourself to the network and get some to in there that you can replay on the, on the Wi Fi, right? Because or or you could literally use your LTE connect which is still up when you connect to the access point, to sort of do some authentication with this through GPP network. And then know, get some some token there. Because, like, if you're trying to figure out, is this is this customer, my customer, on the cell network, then, you know, that you can get some, proof from the cell network that that they are your customer. And then you can replay that proof to your home gateway. Alright. Art. Yeah. If you're you know, tunneling back to your 3 gpp core, then ultimately, this is 3gpp's problem to solve. Right? So I, and and, actually, they already have a solution. So there's already a non free GP access specification. Thank you. You? Yeah.

We are more like, asking for the for the team to say there's a best way to do it because from what we're understanding, yes, all week 1 is see there's a way that that we can communicate with the device saying that you are on the same network, but, on a different asset. And, the the the traditional way that we know about it is using SIP AKA to try to do the authentication, but then this is not happening now today in hung now up. If somebody, like, can point us to the right, document or right solution in the marines. We we appreciate that. But then in the end is we just want to signal, to signal to the device and then so the device can help start exchange some of the information in order to exchange for Alright. Okay. Thank you very much. So with that, I think, Well, we are 4 minutes from the end of the meeting. So there's a good moment to stop. So thank you, sir, everyone. Thanks, you know, for the notes. And, Yeah. I'm quite sure I missed something in the notes. So if you came to the mic. Please double check that I did not corrupt. Whatever you said. Right? I I but that definitely be some of your comments. I marked the semester. So, yeah, just check yeah. Thank you very much. Everyone can can can go and, contribute their text to the to the notes. So please that's a very good point. If you were in the mic. Take a look at the notes and and make sure that, your comments were correctly. Captured, we'll we'll take those notes in a couple of days and make them in 2 minutes. You still have time to to look and make sure that the notes are fine. So thanks, everyone. You make sense. Thanks."
