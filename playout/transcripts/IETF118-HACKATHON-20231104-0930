    "text": "You, during the week and talk with you. Excellent. So why are we here? Well, of course, for Accathon weekends. Creating writing code, but there's also, of course, an ID behind that. So IGF has lots about, about finding consensus, writing drafts, RFCs, but it's also about running code. And that's I think the focus of today is writing code to help the IETF process. During bringing new IDs to the ITS? Or, current drafts that need an implementation, interop proof of concept implementations. There's all here. And, yeah, that's it and and and bring good spirit. Other thing is, of course, and that's all the people that raise our head, hence, just couple of minutes ago, bringing new people to the ITS developers. New generation of people there. And to interact, to bring new IDs. So that's that's the other thing. And I think we're quite as from the past I think we're running now the hackathon for I don't know."

I mean, you're very enthusiastic about people seeing Well, being so enthusiastic to join the the the hackathons. So It's important to know that it's your code. You contribute view writing. It's, your rules. Also, your license is think about what license you want to to use for your, for your projects if you haven't done already. Here on the the example, difficult to read this APL, battery license, public license, Think of other there are number of other licenses can Google for brief moment. Forgot actually the name of the website that's summarizes all the open source slices. But if you have any questions, I'm not an expert I have some clue. If you want to talk about, licenses just, drop me an email or visit my I I'm sitting in front more or less of the of the hackathon"

So they're IETF Contributions. So be aware of that. Everything you present is kind of public. That if you have any questions, if if can either raise your hand. Well, come drop by, later, this pattern. I want to keep it short. All the projects we we work on need to be registered on the Vicky Perrier. Oh, sorry. Vicky, the ICF Vicky pace for the hackathon. There's also for logistics later on for people finding each other and also for presenting, on Sunday. So, Here's the URL. The hackathon wiki. What's on the hackathon wiki? Well, the projects I already mentioned, but I think it's a nice feature for people who Not sure where they want to contribute with the project. They can, go to the, what we call it, the lost and found, page. It's also on the big you can present yourself what kind of, expertise you have. And that different projects can look at, well, this this person would be a perfect match for our project. So make use of that. The other thing is that I just mentioned all the projects and the different tables. Please. Please. Put your table number on the whiteboard at the entrance so people can find the project in which table they are. Because it's really a huge room now. It's difficult to find people projects, projects, So thank you. That's, yep, So we're just this is agenda for today. Yeah, keeping it short. So I should Hurry up now. So, just after this kick off meeting, make sure that all the people are Well, form groups. Let's let's put it that way. At 12"

If you present your results, be very brief. Highlight, highlight, etcetera, the contributions, And after 3 minutes, the next presenter is up. That's it. 4 o'clock, we really have to end the hackathon.
