Some might enforce enforce it on search and fetch. Yes. and others not. So I think we can just word it that it's always enforced on copy and a pen, then it might also be enforced on these other commands. and just leave it at that. Keep it simpler. Okay? Philip, Yeah. This is Philip. tell. think having limits on copy and append and having limits on UIDfetch our our it would be good for Moas to know upfront because Mua's may need to make separate decisions for each of those things. Right? So knowing whether you need to have smaller batches for copies is different than your syncing strategy using UID fetch if do, you know, 1 star or if you need to do those in batches as well.

I haven't thought about this. I think we need to ask team over that he wants. move to be included in the set or not. I think the distinction needs to be made is is this limiting the number of operations or the amount of data that's being added to the system at one time? So This is Barry. And on the other question, I'll I'll defer to the client developers to to answer that, so thanks for the the comment. But the on the difference between moving copy. The thing is that move already allows non atomic moves. So I think the key is the copy and append have to be atomic, and that's why he makes distinction. Thanks. Thanks. Yes. Thank you.

One thing that we, from the client, find problematic about some of this is that it's just being enforced. And if the server, for example, things say, you shouldn't copy more than 10,000 messages But the client logic is that we copy 11,000 messages. the client will just break because it's not a message you It's not the user sort of it's not something that the user can make a decision about.

So after meeting, you update the out, and then ready for working group last call. Thank you. I think the next one's e 2. Okay. Okay. Sorry. while these slides have come up a little background on on this draft. So I have a current draft that's a working group product. documented a sieve snooze action, and in Reviewing it, Pete, correctly mentioned to me that the action within this special snooze mailbox was not very well defined. So in doing that, I took some of Neil's internal spec on a jamap snooze, snooze, method. which had better definition of the mailbox. And I also added a straw man for potential IMAX news command. next slide, please. Okay. So this, basically, I I presented the jmap method in the jmap method group or working group a couple days ago, and there seemed to be interest in moving forward with that. So this would be Similar to that, again, this is just a a straw man. new capability, there'd be a new snooze mailbox attribute, which would coincide with the snooze role in Jmapp"

    "text": "and this would basically flagged the mailbox of where this is where this news messages are gonna arrive, and that would come with some additional semantics. Next slide, please. So this is the trauma that I came up with. This is certainly not cast in stone, but basically three piece metadata would go along with the message when you snoozed it. You'd have the awakened time. a possible mailbox just to awaken it into if it was not gonna be the inbox. And then you could have a set of flags to add and remove at the awakened time which is all of these are identical to what we're already What was already in the SIFs news draft? and what's in the proposed Gmail. snooze draft. Next message. Next slide, please. So this this is the restrictions on this. Basically, the only way to put a message in this news mailbox is to use this news action. So that you actually get the metadata that goes along with it to tell it how to awaken. if you try to get pen copy or move, the servo to reject that, but you could move messages out, which would effectively news them. So the metadata that goes along that message would be removed and you're effectively awaking it. The only issue I have with this is how reflect this in the access control list if the server supports that. does this operate outside those bounds? Because if you remove the insert right It would prevent a copy or move, but it might also prevent this if it's defined to use the same access control. So Couple open issues. The other possibility as opposed to having a new command would be to combine move and annotate so that you you move the message in via move, and then you'd annotate it"

    "text": "with the metadata I don't know if that's better or worse. I think this is probably better off being one action that does everything together, but but Bottom line is is there any interest in trying to create a snooze action or or command for I'm up. I know there's a bunch of the mutations of of snooze out there. I don't know if we could come up with something that would work with all implementations. This could be a wasted effort. But since I was doing this for Jam app, I thought it might be worth throwing together. Barry. do we have to this. But there's certainly specialist mailboxes, but that would limit what can be done with the messages? I'm not aware of any So 3, Yeah. totally agree. The reason I went with a a new command is because in order You need you need a way to add the metadata that tells the server what to do when it awakens. speak to whether Right. I see Pete squirming, which I expect that he might be. you know, I I the speakers and Yes. So I I said my piece over in J Map. I think This is a hacky iffy way to do things, especially because you're adding, this bunch of semantics to"

    "text": "a mailbox that happens to be a special purpose mailbox with restrictions of the magic things that happen, I would rather this be just an annotation that goes with the message and you know, it it's basically a delayed action on the messaging could be pretty much anything that would be the best way to do it. 5. I'm perfectly willing to be in the rough year and just just to clarify. So you're saying implement this as move plus set of notation. That's well, I'm actually suggesting that you could implement this as annotations saying do action later and and that message to live anywhere, not just the snooze mailbox. And I know why it's implemented this way, and I'm I'm not gonna, you know, throw a fit at last call or anything. Yep. Just registering my dick. point taken. And I I I feel you're ill. So now that you'd set that. that may be part of what I was trying what we've generally done with the special use mailbox, attributes. It's people. you put metadata on the message. And then especially in snailbox is just a collection, a a view of all of this to have that Right. if somebody wants to mailbox for you walls selves Message Okay. So are you suggesting then that If it was a new command snooze just does the annotating, Yep. and how the how the UI of the server wants to display that as implementation to find. Okay. We have 4 minutes left, so go Lexi. when"

    "text": "it's it's annotate experiment 1. It was this is the one that does message annotations. the That was the one thing that occurred to me when I originally thought about annotate So I I guess it doesn't necessarily have to interact with annotate to to to Pete and Barry's point. Yeah. The this this news action could just put some put metadata on there in some way, shape, or form whether it can expose the annotate or not is immaterial material. I just wanna counter It's not every client team essentially does group this to phone number. Right. So if you want and also many things more generic. again tends to make things actually less more so once I would actually now So we within one minute, we with another PM 5 clients implemented moving the message somewhere and And and I map this model as you set a flag on the message. anything else Okay. Take take the rest of the list. Yes. Okay. Okay. Nice to that. Okay. So okay. Thank you. Tier 2. So, yes, You. 3 minutes. No. 2 minutes."
