    "text": "penguin young yeah yeah hi right here yeah i'm i'm honey young from china mobile and uh nice to see you and uh i have a question to to ask it's about the patent and when should i public the patent document because sometimes the patenter is still in application in the process of of application it's not been uh authorized so we should publish the should i inform the working group that there is a potential patent in the document so the the short answer to the question is as soon as possible and if you read over the patent policy which is bcp 79 and the rfcs are there it describes when you're when you have to do that um but it goes through when you are individually aware that this is going to uh you know impose on the work and you're participating in a working group you really have to make a disclosure as soon as you can we understand that lots of us work for companies that have particular policies on how to do those disclosures sometimes lawyers have to do the actual written disclosure but even during a working group session you're participating in saying hey just to let you know i think we're going to be making a formal disclosure soon is useful but do check out the rules in the bcp that will give you more details and you can show your if you have attorneys for your company you can show them uh what the request is and they'll understand all the details okay thank you uh another question so what's the consequence of some uh company or some other people use rfc with with patent say that again i'm sorry"
