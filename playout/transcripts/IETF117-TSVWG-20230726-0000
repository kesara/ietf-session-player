For example, for the end to end to react, it would take probably in the order of 50 to a 100 milliseconds while the changes"

So we don't want to really drop the rates As a result of this observation and the need for media some of the media applications that are being addressed here that require both high throughput and low latency. what 3gpp has done is to use a combination of L4S and ECN for the long term handling along with RDT and others. And, also, selective, groups of packets to be dropped. This is now a a 3gppstandardin that operates with unencrypted data. This draft is trying to address how we can class or give information that can categorize and prioritize these how to drop these sets of data, or prioritize or delay or or give headroom to that in the wireless network. So that's the that's an outline of why we are doing this kind of a draft. The criteria for carrying this in and they in some kind of protocol between the media server and this wireless router, that classifies is First, it should be able to do a priority for a group of packets not the whole flow. separate sets may have different priorities. there may be a delay budget associated with it. some may be more important, but can tolerate more delay. for example. And there is a burst size For example, if it's a video iframe, that may consist of 400 packets. And it's useful for the wireless network to know that it should reserve enough headroom"

So For 3dpp, it would be both useful. I think if it's developed in 1 to 2 years. However, I wanna point out that this draft is just about 3gpp. it's a problem that I've talked to my coworkers with, that affects all wireless networks for sure. Wi Fi, and to our understanding even cable networks to a great extent. So that's the problem statement. Let me go to the next page and try to go through the architecture and then how we're trying to address it. So mainly, as was if we go from the the right hand side of the figure, the the server or the what's marked as a server or the application inserts I mean, sends the UDP payload, which is encrypted. which contains a media. information. and add an option, a UDP option called med. and this option gives that data that was mentioned in the earlier slide about priority, delay, and birth size along with some other information. And what the wireless router does is to inspect this data and it's then used to shape and schedule the wireless network. but but but it does not remove the data. It is sent all the way to the client, which may collect this information and use that to send more accurate feedback information to the application. And and then the client to server network acts as a longer"

So this is what the metadata transport option looks like. there are a lot of parameters there. But, mainly, if we look at it, there's importance, which is the relative priority of the packets. There's a timestamp period for which we've received comments. that, you know, it should be adjusted to be more have more resolution, and we'll take that as an action point. There's other aspect, which is an MDU sequence number, which identifies the group of packets that belongs to that to that group of packets. a packet counter and all to keep track of loss and other things. But the key parameters are the other ones, the data burst and delay. along with importance. These are the 3 so far as we know that will be used will have to use to improve the latency and performance on the wireless network. Just to note that, again, the MET is altered, and so it's a safe UDP option. There have been some comments or several comments on this, so I'll address that in slide 6. But I'll just go ahead and complete the discussion in the next page before getting to the comments that they received. Oh, we're already there. Okay. Okay. Good. I think this is where we probably need spend more time because these are the comments that we've received because this is an area which where we could use several mechanisms perhaps.

But there are both sizes and delay budgets that change of applications and time and the way it's encoded and all of that. So these are dynamic properties. So it wouldn't be possible to simply substitute and just have a a parameter. that we could sent and that parameter identified. So this information changes, and so whatever we choose should be able to accommodate that. So with that in mind, Oh oh, and a and a couple of other things. We want a mechanism that obviously can b you know, standardized or, you know, adopted by the group in a a shorter period of time because there's a target related to this, hopefully. And the other thing is that in terms of the architecture, the the nodes that insert this data maybe a a server to the data center but it also may be a wireless node or you know, some other entity that's on the wireless network that's inserting that data. So it's a peer to peer, not just a server to client kind of. traffic So with that in mind, I'll go through the comments that we've gotten I mean, the questions were about why why UDP options and against a whole bunch of other options. So looking at each of those, there's DSCP, And I think based on the discussion on the list, it's the The understanding is that DSCP has limited code points and we need multiple priority levels here. and even more significantly, I think, DSCP just will not be able to convey it's probably impossible to con convey things like bird size and delay budgets.

And my understanding was that you couldn't change it over the length of a session, but think it was clarified by Sebastian that that we could change these for for a group of packets. And so I think that's a very useful update. Maybe we can use that. However, we should note that for IPV 4, there is no flow label. and why we were like to work with just ipv6, I think, for the 3gpp case, week, week, cannot ignore IPV 4 at the moment. IPV 6 hop by hop header extensions are a pretty strong case there. I mean, it's it's feasible in a managed network like 3gpp, which is what this solution is targeting. However, we'd have to look at extending ipv4 options and that seems to be pretty challenging, I think. And the other factor that may play into this that the wireless network entity like a UPF it's not a router per se, but an application that is hosted on a router, or it may be a server in the in the data center in the more recent deployments. So I mean, I'm I'm sure we could do IPV 6 options, but it seems me, at least the UDP options seem interesting enough. to And let me just go over the last one and take my discussion. the UDP options themselves, though, do manage to cover all the cases that are interesting in terms of low latency media RTP and quick.

And I think the options in the trailer may delay I mean, may increase their latency of processing. But we could if the assumption that the flow label can be changed. during the course of a flow, then not every packet needs a lookup at the at the wireless router. Only one group of packets needs to, and we could send a code or some other creative mechanism which we can think of in this group So, you know, we could address that performance aspect by not having to look at everything. For example, if it's an iframe with those 400 packets, we probably only send that code once or twice in the very beginning. And then that code could be sent over the flow label. The flow label. I'll stop there, and this this was a discussion so far. something. So, Gory Furrhus, as an individual in and frequent 6 month participant rather than TSB. You don't include destination which I would have thought was the most likely extension headed to use. rather than hot by hot hot by hot, typically, being used for things that are modifiable along the path rather than things that are end to end. Do you have you thought about using destination options? No. We we briefly looked at only the ipv6 hop by hop options, and that was because we wanted the option to be available at the endpoint so that the endpoint can communicate finder measurements and so on to the application. so that, you know, the application would be aware fully of what the work has done with these packets."

The the flow level sound a found it is immutable for a flow. as it defines what the flow is. So if you use 2 flow levels, you create 2 flows. That's the definition of what the flow label is. And these flows are independently rooted they're independently used by the ipv6 system. Right. I think from the wireless side, I think it should be no problem at all because what we would eventually do is classify into multiple flows that the radio handles in parallel based on these priorities. So it's actually ideal in that sense. But from the IP network itself, my understanding was that this was not possible or there are side effects in terms of how crowded are the 5 all handles it or something else? Yeah. HIP flow V Six flow level determines a flow. Bye. Okay. That's my question. statement. thing. Thank you. Get more clean. Hi. Tom Herbert. So, Corey, One other point I'd I'd make, so if this is if it's required, then intermediate nodes inspect any part of the data By definition, that can't be a destination option Right? Because destination options are n n they're not supposed to be processed intermediate notes. But that being said, that's the the same thing is true for UDP options anyway. So if you go in into that realm, you're in in the realm of basically doing something that is architecturally Not correct.

So for instance, if you say Well, we use the UDP options for some traffic But as an optimization, Hopefully, most of the traffic will use the flow label. Problem with that is if you get into a scenario where The flow label is not available, and and it kinda starts to act like a cache. if your cash miss ratio becomes too high, you may always go to UDP options. And if that's your slow path, that's what can drag down the network. So my recommendation is one or the other, mixing and matching gets really risky because now you have you're you're making assumptions on the work that may or may not pan out. and you also open up a potential for denial of service attack. oh, oh, oh, oh, going to take him.

And speaking with AD, like, just to to talk about this, like, applications of of UDP options. Christian and I have been kinda going on this in Zulu, but There's a class of UDP option application then is let me take the stuff that's in the encryption and put an headers so we can read it again. And, like, I understand it has performance benefit However, that has the has a there's a poor recent track record in the IETF. And and just because this room thinks it's a great idea, does not mean it's gonna survive last call. So I I think we need to think hard about that problem and maybe bring in some outside skeptic before we adopt that particular flavor of UDP option. That's just a general comment about these these proposals. Thank you. So Mike has being was was Mike. requested to be given granting Mike Heard has been looking through the UDP options comments and helping to contribute review, and I was hoping we'll be able to lead discussion here.

And We, 1st of all, thought we'd be useful to look at Joe's proposed 5 basic tenets for developing UDP options. Right. This after Joe came back from vacation to be greeted by many, many messages. He proposed 5 basic tenets I'm in a speaking for myself, I am pretty much in agreements with all except perhaps e where Incomplete frameworks, I think, of are threatening to get us into some some issues. Magnus' Western has raised raised that issue as well. and I thought it might be worthwhile to ask the the working group to reply to that message of Joe's and see if know, take a step back. Are we are we on the the right track with what we're doing. And that's why I put this together. a good question. And, Chris, I I think that helps, Mike. I I think this is Christian wants to step in, please. Please do it, Christian. I I would propose an 6 number 6, tenant, that says that UDP options should never be attached to UDP encrypted packets. And Should not be a time. Should they not be attached to what? Christian?"

There's only tech which warns against it, but not That text was that text was actually removed. it's not actually a tenant. the security considerations. It is not in the latest draft. I mean, it was proposed, but it was not actually added. I think that's correct. proposed but not actively added. Speaking personally, I think that's that that the proposal is correct. but I'm an individual. Because, I mean, all all the abuse that we saw in the previous presentation about taking encrypted information and put it that in clear text so the network can read it. And and we don't want that. I mean, that's not what that's bad architecture. That's not what we want. and so it should be very clear that No. Don't do that fine because it transports. a Mira, I mean, I do agree kind of, but it doesn't that kind of contradict first thing here, it kind of makes UDP stateful, and especially it makes puts dependency in UDP on higher layer knowledge, which you might not No. It does not matter. Basically, if you put that in your text, that means that any at protocol that knows any end station, any router that knows that you are carrying, say, quick, for example, will drop any packet that carries a UDP option because it's only an attack. In other words, you talk to use a tunnel header or something else rather than the UDP to do that. That's even worse. So I just add like, I just use some space based in your packet at a UDP option and make sure somebody drops it. At at the minimum, you drop the damn option."

    "startTime": "00:48:07",
    "text": "I'm not sure how that helps. but maybe I don't understand it. No. Basically, it create it creates a blocking point to deployment. Because if you block deployment, then you block the abuse at the same time. If you don't block deployment, then the abuse gets ingrained in the network and become hard to remove after that. So you want a middle box to somehow figure out that whatever is above the UDP header, is encrypted or quick or whatever, which is the feature that we didn't build into quick. And then you want a middle box to interfere with the packet. If it is not the meter bug that does it, then the endpoint shall do it. But the endpoint can always just ignore the GDPR option anyway. No. It shall actively destroy the packet. Again, that's Because it's not that because because because because you did because also in function never do that. So the data is obviously gonna attack it should be destroyed. But but that option attack that I can easily destroy a packet. I don't know. If you can modify it, but if if a 9 point can modify it by 10 that can modify the packets, then you don't need a UDP option to make that packet useless to the endpoint. Martin Duke, I I don't know if we're still on the tenants or we're talking something else. But I mean, so I I there's, like, 2 separate issues here. One is, like, should we have a later rate instruction in UDP options that say, like, UDP options shall not do this. And then, you know, We're not the protocol police, but, like, they should not do this. And then should should we have some sort of actual enforcement mechanism that punishes endpoints that break the law"

On the same point of I think Anything that would do that obviously breaks some feature of a protocol. Right? It wouldn't be accepted by ATF, but I think Christian thinks Synchrony, I think you're you're a little bit to Network can do worse. So, for example, network can remove once con the signal is consumed remove the UDP option. So it's transmitted. so it's not as easy as to say that, oh, okay. Just don't do it because you will never deploy it. it's deployable. with a copywriting network. it's a question whether you want to do it, but that's like a different debate. Christina, have you finished? Shall we take you out of line? No question. Okay. Christine, go ahead then. Yes. Networks can attach data to packet. can do that. Of course. They can do encapsulation. They can do whatever they want. But if they do remove it, then we have we are in a bit of place, and if they don't. because that means that it stays inside single hop single networks. Control domains, whatever it is you call it. much better than trying to build this end to end communication channel that's it also we move all the men. Let's face it.

The surplus area can already be transmitted. There is no new threat. No. It is new to it. No. It is not. Well, it already exists. It already has existed ever since UDP exists That is. Alright. But that's the fax. It is true that it that endpoints can add I mean, intermediate can add data at the tail of the IT packet. That is true. What is not true is that endpoint are supposed to process it. the which you are not supposed to do now So if you add the idea that the endpoint are supposed to process if you do indeed increase their tax office. we need to decide if we wanted to discuss any other copper comments or whether you just wanna hold on the rest and cover them next meeting. So You to want comment? Tom Herbert, So I think to Christian's point, if we extrapolate this, we deploy UDP options, If and there's ever a denial of service attack because of them the net the the response from a network provider may very well be just drop all packets with surplus options. And I think that is a very real risk that's the simplest thing they can do at the edge."

And I would I I'd really like to hear more feedback on that I'm sure Joe Wood it's I I think it's a dangerous situation if something so central is not getting enough review. I complained about that privately to Gauri planning about it publicly to everyone else. The encryption and authentication options, Magnus is kind of throwing down the gauntlet that they're just not mature enough to keep in the spec at this time. after vacillating a bunch about 30 minutes before this meeting began, I sent a message to the list saying that I think that that's probably true. but we need the working group as a group needs to resolve those matters and decide whether to defer those latter 2 to another document The I think those are the 3 really important things we've got I absolutely have to do before we can ship this specification.

In the working group, you can also vote against it. This is an input point to help us understand what to do in this. as we're coming to the close of the meeting, I'm going to ask one more question, which I think would help us a lot. Who thinks the authentication work should be completed first in this document as part of this document. So should we complete the proposed authentication work as part of this single document. or should we split it out as a separate piece of work possibly into another draft and progress it there.

We've run out of time. This is the end of this TSVWG slot. ask a clarifying question on the encryption thing? Yes. Martin. Can I Well, that was pretty firmly negative. does that mean people do not want to try to perfect the, like, improvise crypto that he came up with or people don't want to address, like, have any encryption solution made with some sort of more off the shelf so first and so on. didn't really ask that because I presume we could if we complete UDP options, we could always do encryption work after if there was enthusiasm to do so. Okay. So so so you interpret that as meaning we should not And at the moment, unfortunately, as I stated on the list, my share position on this is we don't have a basis for doing this. We don't have a document which is complete to describe the encryption enough to make it a useful interoperable spec. So we would have to have people to work on that Yes. And we had only one person raise their hand supported doing that. And that was me. That was you. Okay.
