Are they trying to make sure that all received all received headers are using the same? format? Because I think that you are probably you know that boat is sailed there's just way too many different cases I can say there and generate a couple thousand different formats and we already have. I can't speak for Doug. If you go to the mailing list and see what he, the gist of it, at least what I took away from it was there's a, there's enough commonality amongst certain providers that he can reliably parse certain pieces of and wanted to have that documented Again, like I said, we do parse it all and it's several thousand that are in common use of different formats.

I think we should at least support Doug's, you know, the intention that this should be, you know, we should have better stand in received headers, but maybe it needs to be an external document rather than in here that might document some of the most common form as examples Yeah, again, somebody needs to write a document right? So we can have a look and then have a judgment but not here, I think I'm sorry to jump. Elliot, is this something? that would be appropriate, like a cataloging effort here? for the ISCE? If someone were to take up the work, I am not volunteering anyone to do so All right, so the independent submission process is that you submit it, I consider it, I send it out for reviews, and I don't generally judge things. I don't be judge things but and this is a big but, what weighs on me in this case is that is the comment that was made earlier that implementations can change in a moment's notice. And so, an rfc should be somewhat timeless it doesn't have to be timeless to eternity but there has to be a really good reason to publish something that is a likely to lack that timelessness. So why are you documenting it at this very point? And that would be what I would focus the question on if it came to me I think if anything, if you're going to do anything here, my recommendation is along these lines. I think it's"

So this is something, this is actually something we have the, although the although the agenda of what happens is MOG is top secret, we have lightning talks and working sessions and this might be an interesting topic to see if they're mail systems that would be interested in doing it it Define more broadly, define your implementer base and see if the implement are interested in participating in in this case right, it's, you know, your mail delivery services, you know, at different layers right, not just the ad, you know, the mail sends and all those people, but, you know, much broader, you know base.

Or should we just discourage? you know using C name if you want to go to the next slide i think john had some pseudo pseudo-proposed texts that I highly at the bottom Yeah, it's it, John. Let me I'm actually supposed to be in DNS up presenting something and I can tell you that if you ask the DNS people, what is the maximum length of the C-name chain? They'll say, don't make it too long. But for 30 years, they have specifically, refused to make come up on the numerical limit and then not going to do one now. So I think we could say long C name chains are a source of trouble, but there's nothing unique to mail about that, so I don't see why we need to talk about it Did you catch that? I couldn't actually hear because of the car behind this can whatever is going back on going out on the hall back here is polluting what we can hear? I will try to speak slowly and clearly although i am not very good at it The DNS community has specifically refused to set numerical limits for the amount of work to resolve something. And there is nothing unique about long-see-name chains for MX, long-see-name chains present the exact same problem for every DNS lookup So I don't see why we have anything to say about it Is that I suppose, if they refuse to say there is nothing we can point to saying to their refusal to say it it It is effectively it's suggesting not to use it, right?"

And truly, there is nothing unusual about it for mail. So I just don't see that we have anything useful to say about it Okay, Linda Speaking from operational experience, we very regularly use two to three D-C names seeing changes for our service just because of how we have to partially host customer subject and stuff like that inside the service So, you know, it's there and it's happening. Why not be curious about is can we go service? the email software authors and find out, hey where do you put your internal limits on this? Because obviously people have to be clamping it down somewhere So they're pointing back to the resolvers at that point This may be a little repetitive, but the resolvers have to deal with questions of C names and randy bush name server lookups and D names and all this other stuff for every single lookup they do you know, so it would be really weird to try to put special rules for mail because there's nothing special about our DNS lookups Like you look up the name and you get the answer and there might be all this"

I think if you haven't found it by that meaning, you're on going to get there, but I mean, speaking personally developer part of me would like to you know, to have a survey and find out what people are used but I appreciate it's a big doubt you know, to have a survey and find out what people are using, but I appreciate it's a, it's a big ask and somebody has to do the work work Well, here's a question. If you're doing the C-name lookup, and the C name is in a different domain, and it's into domain for which you don't yet have the name servers, how many levels down of name server lookup are you willing to do? per C name lookup? Like this is not an answer. This is not a question you want to try to answer as a man to try to answer as a mail server because it's all over in the dns I mean there's it's more stuff than C names that can cause long change of work work Okay. John? issues have associated complication and questions is to what really was a primary server like canonical server, a server you might want to trust or not, and you can uncertain front of that, either DNS server or mail server"

And there was just a firm prohibition against starting down the staff. Now, given that we took that out at some stage and I'm not able to figure I when and we're clearly down this path we can either say nothing or we can say more or less what I said in the, in that suggestion long ago, which is if these chains get too long, some systems may stop them and therefore they may lead to trouble or or or praising some of the comments chat with being made the vine mate we we hear ourselves in trouble because you can't, you can't really make couple rules about it out the DNS works once we decide to get into the situation where C-name records are permitted rather than being prohibited all together So if we know that there are implementations that will give up after a while, then I know in the AS, which says, you know, launch chains badge, you should try to avoid them if you can specifically avoiding defining law it wouldn't be reasonable, and otherwise you should give up instead about this Yeah, can I just quickly respond?

So at least having some explanation that this limit is in DNS land, you know, it might be kind of obvious but we don't describe limit anything else So at least having some explanation that this limit is in DNS land, you know, it might be kind of obvious, but we don't describe limits at the mail system level Yeah, I think maybe there's a distinction here which is useful. We should not be given advice to mail system in implementers about how long a chain they should tell us It is reasonable to give it advice to male system implementers that some system impose a limit on how long they will tolerate and as a consequence setting these things up in ways which use long chains, which is an operational issue about how many servers is set up and as defined in DNS and not how those servers operate It's a reasonable thing to do, so it's a, it's a little bit of a subtle distinction there. But if the suggestion is that we start giving out advice as to where systems should draw the line, I think that's a nightmare and a nightmare for reasons you already discussed to tell people that some systems do draw the line and if they're on long chains, they should be aware of the possibility getting errors that way, that's a different matter entirely okay so uh have two more people who wants to speak up but can I suggest you suggest some text and we have a look look I okay I so yeah up, but can I suggest, you suggest some text, and we have a look. I, okay. I sort of see I have already, but okay. Yes, but like instead of, yeah, I would like to see specific text, which is improvement on what is on the slide Thank you Could I make a suggestion?

I think warning people is fine in the standard Keep it short. You may have problems. But yeah, like, if DNS won't say anything, I think it would be a nightmare if we said something Okay And I was going to say, make you maybe even a further suggestion simply actually discourage the use of C name total because there are complications which may result in a problem, and at least it will align it with not using C names mail and receipt Maybe that's worth asking whether we should discourage just the use of C name period Yes exactly, that sort of a correct to me as well. So I think we're not quite done on this one I think Jod Clancy will suggest some text If people want to propose do counter-proposal on the main list, then we should do that. And let's try to just write this up quickly. It's not a lot of things but I think we and suggestion if we cannot come up with the text which is we think is improvement on saying that if we cannot come up with the text which is we think is improvement on saying nothing then the fallback is we'll just say nothing and close the ticket.
