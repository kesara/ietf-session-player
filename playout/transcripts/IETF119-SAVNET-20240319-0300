Let's have a quick review, version 05, which was presented in last IETF, In version 05, we we introduce intra domicile as a texture, Specifically, when we introduce Start related information, including self specific information and the local rough information. They describe the content in South specific information and explain why self specific formation can general more accurate savvy laws than local route information. We also introduced 2 rules of cabinet routers, and self specific information communication mechanism, and the several generation procedures. We then use 2 use cases to illustrate that intradumbens found that can achieve more accurate and more efficient than existing cell mechanisms. And then we finally describes how intradominant subnet can meet the 5 design requirements proposed in the problem statement, And in last IETF meeting, we received several comments on version 05. These commerce can be divided into 2 main categories, The one is about architecture improvement and the other one is buffed improper OMPQS worse.

Which also runs routing protocol. And a s borderouter is an intradomer router, which is connected to other a s's. And then we asked We add a figure to overview intra domain soundnetarchitecture, in the updated version before we introduce the details of intra domain sound picture We first gave the some goes for different routers. Host facing router should generate several hours on interfaces facing the host network, and block detailed package received at those interfaces with source addresses not belonging to the host network.

And then routers can generate more accurate sub rules by using sub specific information provided by other routers, and it's all in self specific information and routing information in the local feed or reef. If necessary, So here shows 2 examples For for example, in this figure, route b can identify all prefixes belonging to the custom network by using its own self specific information and the self specific information received from Rock A And then it can perform accurate style filtering add interfaces facing the customer network. And for routerdoroutere, it can identify all prefixes belonging to the ES by using self specific information provided by a router a, route to b and route to c, and then that you accurate style filtering.

For this proxy based method, we use a scanner to send, a DNS query to the dense proxy in the target network. And the the dense proxy we will not modify the source, the IP address and forwarded, the multiply the dense requests to the dense resounders. So their system is a spoof packet whose source IP address is client, but not, the dance proxy. So in this way, our scanner will receive dense response from the dangerous bar, DNS resolver. Directory, similarly, the DNS response, maybe will not change the by the DNS proxy. However for a scanner, the structure of, the internet is a black box we cannot figure out what happened, in the Internet when, receiving a DNS response with a source IP address that is different from the destination after the drive of the DNS query.

So let's go into the details the uh-uh on a cystphy object we are proposing a new content type and, we intend to registered these, numbers through Ayana And, this, this object will contain 2 important information. The first one is the AS ID, which contains the AS number of that of the AS that have deployed and want to establish your software connections And the second one is the IP address of the soft net agent, within that AS. So, to validate, assist you all the Reliant Party must, perform all the validation checks specified in RC 6488, as well as the following additional specific validation steps, including has identified delegation extension the, EEA certificate as identified delegation extension. And the IP address authentication extension. That one must be absent. So a router can use a AS pass from BGP announcements, they ask us for objects and, SSP, to actually find the closest or the most appropriate to set up some subnets appearing. A potential procedure can like this. So, it can, 1st identify the closest ASU thing, using the, as far object and the ASPAS information. And then the, Cisco object can be utilized to determine which of the have already have deployed the soft net. And, you can select the candidate sharing, ASs. And, the selection might include multiple factors, including, existing, hearings policies"
