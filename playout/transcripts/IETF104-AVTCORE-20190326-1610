    "text": "there needs to be some definitive some way to definitively conclude which set of rules apply when evaluating was right there the problem is that both registries have media types in them so somebody I mean I think we\u0027ve already established that one of them is affected you know is yeah the art could be specific one is it effectively redundant and on to lead I\u0027m concerned about the other one right so got it so what we have to figure out is how to make sure that somebody comes in and registers a media type the media types experts know that they need to consult the RTP people because this one is related to RTP and there isn\u0027t any way to do that now unless the registrant says it in their in their registration request we\u0027ve relatively recently I own maybe four years ago updated the media types registration procedures we could certainly do an update to that that updates the template and says are there RTP implications to this registration and hopefully the people would then say oh yeah I\u0027ve fill this filled in and things would happen better that\u0027s the best that\u0027s the best way I can come up with to do it okay somebody else in the queue oh you done Paul yeah Jane Sanford author of the ttml document and I just wanted to add a little bit more context in that the case that we have had and the media type was created and I guess that the original authors either didn\u0027t consider the RTP might be an option for transporting it or it was just seen as one of the many options and once all of groups so in that case the media type was created and then we came along afterwards and said let\u0027s let\u0027s create a payload for this over RTP so in that case it\u0027s it\u0027s less than noticing that it\u0027s suitable for RTP it\u0027s us picking something else that is not unsuitable for us he peeled we would like to use it over RTP so it\u0027s it\u0027s perhaps a bit more complicated than just is this suitable for RTP [Music] have you finished gyms yes sorry okay sorry press the red button right okay : "
