I believe it's a zero one or maybe zero two by now So that's progressing. It's next simple, we've had four interim meetings since IETF 119 there have been a lot of work on the document and a number of updates TED, I believe, is going to give us an overview of those And yeah, what do we want to say about next steps post-snacks? simple document completion? Yeah, we touched upon it last time our focus is to finish this document and then get the pulse from the room. What do we want to do next? next? So, yeah, we are focusing on this document, but at the same time, we have to think about, should we continue this group? with subsequent work or this is it and then take subsequent work to int a area or some other work groups so that's work or this is it and then take subsequent work to INT area or some other work groups. So if we want to talk about it for a couple of minutes, right? now is a good time Mr. Eadie, would you have some comments or? guidance for us? So, Eric Wink if we don't have any more work, if there is, I don't see any energy to go past the snacks simply then it clearly will become dormant maybe for one IETF, then we close There's no point keeping a working group open if there is no work being done there"

We definitely, I mean, I will say from my perspective, working at Apple, we definitely intend to do that work, whether it happens here or not. I'd like to see that work standardized in the IETF. It doesn't have to happen in this work group. I mean, a lot of the work that we would be talking about would be DNSD stuff So maybe it could just happen to the DNSD working group Some of it might be routing stuff there. It's going to be a little less clear because I don't know, like it's not really routing stuff in the sense of like we need a new routing protocol. It's routing stuff in the sense of do we need to participate in infrastructure routing and if so how and you know there's also like you know still here what is it 2020 we don't have actually a document from dhc explaining how router advertisements are routers or sorry, prefix delegation, delegated prefix are routed, and that's why of the gaps that we have here.

The answer? is, the answer is, I haven't had time to think about that yet, but I certainly want to to I just want to say, because I think it's important. Ted is doing heroic work, and we're really need more help and we just hired one more person at Apple to work with Ted so I'm doing my best to take some of the burden of Ted but I want to acknowledge the amount of work Ted does both write code and debugging code and writing the drafts that documented it.

Anyway, so we've had a bunch of interim meetings since the last IETF member meeting or member meetings. Since the last, since IETF 119. And we've been doing document editing in each meeting, and we've made quite a bit of progress so there was a big debate last time about what we should call stub routers because we decided that stub router was a too broad of a term snack routers or a subset of stub routers and and I got to use the fun subset symbol there. I just talked to break about that. And so we we were kind of having trouble figuring out what term and somebody just said why don't you just say snack routers? And we were like, OK okay. So that's what we're doing. So we're calling it to snack route And there's changes littered throughout the document to deal with that question came up about prefixes being advertised and what to do when a prefix that was advertised on the Stub network to do when a prefix that was advertised on the SNAC on the stub network is by the way snack router stub network because the snack router is just one kind of stub router connect a stub network to an infrastructure network So, stub network. So if we've been advertising a prefix on the stub network, and then we decide that we need to deprecate it for some reason, like for example our prefix delegation wasn't renewed or some preference like maybe maybe we were publishing a ULA"

We still need to advertise a route to that prefix on infrastructure until the valid life expires because we might have ongoing connection Somebody might have cached that address and might still be using it. We wanted to continue to work as long as it actually can work. There was a question that came up about the L-bit in the PIO So this is the on-link bit There are some link layers where you don't set the L bit None of us knew what any of those link layers were or how they worked So we decided that the best way to solve this problem was to make it out of scope, and we did. The document now says this is out of scope There was a big debate at IETF 119 about the setting of the M&O bits and we have some people who have still healing wounds from various previous conversations about this. It turns out that RFC 4860 says that the M and O bits have to be consistent on the link, but it doesn't say how to do that. And it turns out that that's actually really hard. In fact, it might even be NP complete So we aren't doing that And instead, we are requiring that stub-roters set the Eminobits to false false So yeah, so, DHGP prefix delegation is stateful and is dependent on what link you're connected to. And so we added some stuff in the document, mostly just referring to the DHC V6 protocol specification explaining how or really just telling you where to look to figure out how to deal with the problem of what happens if your stub router is suddenly connected to a different network So just some additional text. Most of it is just pointing at the DHC document and not actually specifying anything"

The intention was that this was going to be a way that devices on this stub network could reach out to the internet if they needed to contact the internet services, and those services were IPV4 only, because stub networks are IPV6 only So we have some quite a bit of additional text talking about this and explaining the motivation and so forth We added a very brief security consideration section basically saying read RFC 4861 And we added a long appendix that describes all of the different deployment scenarios we were able to imagine which if anybody wants to read that and see if there's a deployment scenario that they can imagine that we failed to imagine please tell us And basically the idea was just, like explain whether a snack router would work on this network. And the answer in most cases is yes, and the answer in a small number of cases is no. And that's correct behavior It shouldn't work on those networks that's very convenient on our part So, and then we added two additional sections on our A is one for what our look like when they're advertised on the infrastructure. The idea was to detail every single field in the RAs, so like, you know, an implementer doesn't have to guess or figure it out It's just specified. And same with RAs sent on the Stub Network if you're doing router advertisements on the Stub Network And the forward button isn't working, so I think that means I'm done You're done.

    "text": "Yeah, so I really do think that you break some deployed implementations if you set the M&O flags to false. I mean, you know, I not that I would ever endorse willingly using it, but network manager does look at the M&O flags for the purpose of like figuring out whether it needs to do DGP. I think if you see it to zero, then it won't do DCP and just sit there and spin So if, so suppose there's a infrastructure router and there's a stub route and the infrastructure router is sending router average advertisements with a router lifetime of zero is the network manager going to prefer the M&O bits? that are from the router lifetime zero? router advertisement, or is it going to prefer the one from the other router or is it going to just alternate? We talked about this a lot and the conclusion was it's probably going to, when it sees the M&O bits set to one it's going to take advantage of that and if they get set back to zero, it's not going to change But if when you connect, you see the last array that you see is it. So, okay, so Linux has this. It's a print-of-place lag, and you can query it and so if you start network manager when you just have received an array with the M and O bits at zero, it won't do D-26. Okay if your network relies on DGV6 then you I think you broke it I mean, not that, anyway, I think you break some So, clarifying question, Lorenzo Suppose you set, suppose network manager starts up that way and then it receives a router advertisement with the M&O bit set to one What happens then? Whatever they wanted? I don't know I mean it might like start again it might time out it might read the flag at the beginning My point is, like, generally, you- don't know. It might start again. It might time out. It might read the flag at the beginning. My point is like generally, if you want to say we're not breaking existence, implementations, you, you kind of have to serve it them.

So we had this discussion in March and the conclusion was that we weren't aware of any cases where this would make things worse. The problem is that we like, the spec and RFC 4866, is just wrong. Like, there's no way to implement it This is something that Suresh had to wrestle with quite a bit a few years back. I don't think he's in the room, but mean, I think if you just copy the ones from the most recently received R.A., you can just copy them, and that's fine. It's strictly better than saying they must be set to zero. So what do you mean by the most recently received R.A? What if the infrastructure router turns the M&O bits off? Then you copy zero from there. Okay, so then the most recently received one is like the one that we go, the most recently received infrastructure bits that we got So, all right, so, so in other words, you're saying that if we receive an R.A with the M&O bits set to one and the stub rudder bit set to zero that we see words, you're saying that if we receive an RA with the M&O bits set to 1 and the stub router bit set to 0, that we start reflecting those bits, and then it later we receive another array possibly seconds later, with the M&O bits set to 0, zero and the stub router bit set to zero then we start sending zero bits. I would, yes cache the result of the most recently RA that we can about, and we just cache that result And the next array, we send whatever we heard most recently. Okay so this is a good, this is a good because what you're basically saying is if the network is broken we can't fix it yeah and if the network is not broken then we aren't going to break it by this. We might. Right. Well, you don't really. Well, if we if we wouldn't be breaking. It's not perfect, right? For example, what if we haven't heard an RA? But, you know, it's true strictly better than like always setting it to zero yeah but i mean we start up with a with you know in router we we start up trying to discover routers. So in principle, if there is a router present, we will know what the bits are supposed to be. And if you're not, then your network is"

The other thing, so L equals zero, we said like there's no, we don't, we can of anything that would do it that way. I mean, people do set it is, yeah, is that a problem? Well, no, no, it could be that something sets it to zero The point is, what should we set it to? Okay, yeah, yeah in our PIO yeah and the answer is we don't know of a, we don't, we don't know enough about use cases where it would be set to zero to be able to say And so that's why we say that's out of scope like it's you don't need to set it to zero on Wi-Fi you don't need to set it to zero on Ethernet I don't know of a layer two where you do need to set it to zero I'm sure there is one, but I doubt it's one that we care about. So basically what we said is we just don't support that You know, it doesn't mean that you can't do an implementation for that layer two. You're just going to have to figure out what the answer is we're not going to tell you. I think if you said it to zero, it might just not work, right? Because if there's no default gateway, then the host has nowhere to send it Okay mean, it's sort of unlikely that there's a link type where we can send RAs, but like L equal one will not work i suppose right that was that was our reasoning. Yeah, yeah, the only one I'm aware of is doxas. You have to set it to zero to get it to go back to the CMTS so they do that on the cable modem side okay but that's not a problem for you guys so I think you're yeah a combination stub router cable modem.

It's like fundamentally impossible, so thanks for pointing this out and I think maybe I don't know if you can fix it but at least I guess we can try to fix the standard at least. Yeah, we should do can fix the real world, right? But yeah, I agree with what Tim said. Yeah, I don't think you need to fix this problem.

These are fair points Okay, so that's something we could definitely do That's a significant change Document, so we talked about, I just mentioned this that snack riders are not really needed for managed infrastructure if it's managed infrastructure. It's not really a snack router Like, in other words, if you are, if you are something on the snack router, it's not a snack router because it's not auto-configuring right So there's a question about interrupt goals goals Are the RA requirements for the snack router only for RA beacons or also for Unicaster? RAs? That's a fun question. The answer I think is yes Clarify yes Are the RA requirements for snack router only for RA beacons or also for Unicast RAs? Unicast RAs when somebody sends you, sends a router, a beacon is the one that you send, you multi-cast unsolicited, yeah. Unsolicited, yeah I use the term beacon in my code, I don't know, we might even use it in the document I'm not sure. It was used. Uh-oh, I should probably think that.

You can have a document that is three or four pages of a really simple design, and if you just want to read it and believe the authors, you don't have to read very much If you read it and don't believe the authors, then there's a whole bunch of supporting information that explains the reasoning which is up to you if you care about that I think that's a fine way to have it document okay So I'm okay with bike shedding some more on this but we could also move on All right.

So I think the answer is that we should specifically exclude prefixes that were not advertised by this particular router So is it, is it just a sim? them and let them time out? Yeah, I mean, so it's possible that the other Stubrater just went away, in which case the pre- that it was advertising isn't reachable anywhere but I don't think we could really fix that problem Why does it say this dumb network, is it implicit that it's its Stub Network, the one it's authoritative for, or? think we could really fix that problem. Why does it say the Stub Network? Is it implicit that it's Stub Network, the one that's so authoritative for? So. Because there's no such thing as this stub network, there will be more than one, right? So mean, in principle, there can be more than one, but I think, um, it's not even a simplifying assumption to say we we only really need to speak about one specific stuff network and the behavior, if you have more than one, then you're going to be implementing the same behavior for each stub network.

I mean, I don't know if there's any other text in the So I thought it sounded like we weren't continued to advertise deprecated prefixes so. So the idea is we're going to advertise, suppose what prefixes, so. So the idea is we're going to advertise, suppose, like there are a number of scenarios that can happen, right? One is, stub router a is connected to the stub network subbrother b is connected to the Stub Network, Stubrother A has been advertising a prefix on the Stub Network, Stubrother B gets manages to get a DHCP V6 prefix and starts advertising that. That supersedes the ULA prefix that Stub Browder A was advertising So that ULA prefix is still valid And so we still want at least Router A to be advertised a route to it, but it's deprecated so we don't but it's like deprecated what do you need is it deprecated in in terms of Router A's understanding of that? Well, so the question is, does Router A need to take responsibility? for advertising a route to it? I think the answer is no So that's, that was our, yeah. I don't understand why you need to involve PD in this. Even if you have two two stop buters that you know, have, well, yeah, I mean, the other scenario would be you have two stub routers, they both connect at the same time, they both advertise a pre- One of them notices that its prefix is not the winning prefix and stops advertising it.

Okay So there's BRA, B, I'm gonna call it BR, BRA, BRA BRC, right? So one of the is the one that sets the stub reader flat. One of these is responsible for originating the pio on the link Right. I don't know who, like, I don't know what term I should use for that one. That's, that's, I think we call that the, the, uh, the acceptable prefix or something like that.

Okay, it's special because it won. All right only one of them that wins, okay? But the other three all each presumably advertise the things that are behind them yeah right so i think that's like really not clear here, right? so this is talking about the route information option Yes.

So we don't care about what some other stub router is doing, and we don't have any information about what that other subrother is doing other than what we see in it RA. So I guess that I think maybe the confusion is an active snack router, does, did we have a, did we have a meaning for active? So I think, I think your problem is advertised then, because if I, like going back to my example with A, B, and C advertising is sending a PIO and you could argue you could totally argue that that is like meets the meaning of advertising here. So I think you would say each RIO that has prevailed that it has previously sent Because advertised could mean that you're advertising a PAO, which is like really, not what you mean here, right?

And I had previously been sending REOs on the infrastructure network saying, you can reach this prefix, you can reach it stub network a prefix and that prefix is now deprecated right and I had previously been sending REOs on the infrastructure network saying you can reach this prefix you can reach this right now that prefix is deprecate And the question arises, should I keep sending these RIOs, right? And I think what Tim is saying is, anyone who heard those REOs, including hosts, will still be able to reach them Anyone, and so anyone who has not heard those ARIOs will not be able to reach them. However, the point of deprecated addresses is to continue existing connections And therefore, we don't need to tell new hosts on the link how to reach the deprecated prefixes because they don't care, because they're going to be no connection there, I think.

So yeah, it's not, it's basically either way I feel it will work out so it's not sure something that you may need, you may want to spend too much time Okay, so I am, um, scrolling through the document and we need once actually specify that snack routers have to provide IP forwarding between the stub network and the infrastructure network in any way at all. What's that? It's obvious. It's a given It implies it we don't have to specify it for, anyway don't have to specify it for Yes. Anyway, so we need to add some text about this. Like, like we just literally don't have any text about this at all Sorry, but Ted, you don't need to say that a writer writes packets, do you? It's going to forward I have worked with companies that would ship a product and claim it met their respect completely and forwarded no packets. We need to say that It's sending the right router advertisements. I don't know why no packets are flowing Obviously a bug in the spec. That's called a competitive advantage I believe. We should let them keep doing that"

    "text": "that It's going to be amusing to see what we, what you achieved, what you were able to write there Because like the obvious thing around must forward packets is going to fall over immediately as soon as somebody says we need a firewall Oh, no, we've had that decision that's the job of the rFC 784 router That's not our problem Okay, I see. So, okay, so it must forward old packets? That's nice. That's great like that's great because like I actually got into trouble with the thread team when they said that we needed a, when we needed a firewall between the AIL and the thread network. I say we can't implement that and they said you must I'm like uh do it in OT day Damon or something. And they did. But anyway, maybe that's not a snack requirement, but a third requirement Well, I mean, you definitely, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a constrained network. So you definitely need to make sure that you're not forwarding packets to the constrained network faster than they can be delivered. Yeah this is the thing, so I guess I'm going to have to open an issue on this. Okay. Maybe we'll have to revisit it I don't know, but any forwarding device has to be able to be defensive It's just that simple. Any part of your infrastructure, any part of anybody's infrastructure can be attached and can be harmed So there's a need at least for some amount of defensiveness Yeah, I think we can work out wording to cover this. The intention with the threadboarder router is that conceptually it's like a Ethernet Switch or a Wi-Fi access point in bridge mode that you plug it in, it connects, it doesn't get it the way. Now that said, have extra admin options where"

    "text": "if you want your Ethernet switch to filter a certain packets you can buy a high-end switch that does that but I think our language should be that by default it should forward all packets. That doesn't, but must By default, it must forward all packets in both directions But if you want to have to add to manual control language should be that by default it should forward all packets. That doesn't, but must. By default, it must forward all packets in both directions. But if you want to have to add to manual configuration or otherwise, that's okay But out of the box, we want an average user. And remember, the target market here is home users, so we want them to play it in and have it work and not have to call Geeks Squad to fix it i i remember now when i got into trouble There was like, oh, but this port must never be forward because it's security sensitive. And then it was like, oh, this is this, the OMR range is okay to forward but the LMR so the mesh local must never be forwarded. And I'm like, okay, well so anyway i don't know if that you know maybe they were trying to you know pull a fast one on me i don't know but uh yeah, so the mesh local prefix is essentially intended to be analogous to a link local prefix. But then that must not be forwarded. So, yeah, must not be forwarded is right. It's links go. Well, it's it's mesh scope. It pleases me that we are learning more about this requirement as time goes on lucky you Glad we're able to help help Okay. Yeah, right, so Kieran just for my name me we've got one minute left in this meeting. Slot Oh, this is an hour and a half slot. Damn right, well, this was actually a good place to stop because I'm going to need to actually sit down and think about this text. This one needs some text and maybe we need a substitute just to dedicate it to this to talk about it somewhere. Yeah. So I didn't want to rush into this section Yeah, no, but this is really good because like this is a glaring omission that we hadn't even noticed until now we did talk about host to device communication reachability We did. Reachability, but forwarding Okay Yeah, like, it's funny that we didn't think of this"

Thank you everyone for participating Is there any preference for time slots so that we get more attendance for interim meeting? Really is better for me yeah we can poll it again on the Today generally assume that the default time zone is California because that's where my employer is. So when I say early, I mean relative to California. So in other words, I want the people in California to have to suffer. No way zone is California because that's where my employer is. So when I say early, I mean relative to California. So in other words, I want the people in California to have to suffer. No, wait. You didn't hear me sad okay thanks everybody thank you guys Thank you very much course. Thank you and nice meeting you. You too Once again Again Again Again you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This document is not can think we should be documenting any of the reporting before. Like, we're describing the behavior of our router. A router is already defined defined"
