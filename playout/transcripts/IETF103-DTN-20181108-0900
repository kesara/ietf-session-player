    "text": "changed the we say that this is a different paradigm so we changed yeah security context ID but now there you go thinking mark a proposal such as that and then it\u0027s it\u0027s a new definition that can be defined you can say it refers to another block in in the bundle or it\u0027s in line and includes the cipher the information or it\u0027s a pre placed thing pre shared and it\u0027s just a whatever that\u0027s required and a big blob of number four the the only concern about that ended as a minor concern is if and I\u0027m not disagreeing but if we have some sort of a reference or context ID that by its nature is ephemeral and you are in a DTN there there may be some question of you then assume that if something has been queued for days or weeks and when it gets to another end and it says I have contacts X that that may have been you know expired in some way whereas if you say I\u0027ve been encrypted with a certain set of keys and so on I mean keys themselves are ephemeral it may not be a difference that makes a difference it is another ephemeral thing that we need complete agree with you but I don\u0027t see that that\u0027s a problem with the specification if people wanted if people want to set up an ephemeral relationship and some of the bundles last longer than the ephemeral relationship exists then and I\u0027m looking at Stephan to tell me that we ought to document that that is a whole you can fall in but that\u0027s a whole you can fall in because you\u0027ve dug it speaking just a little remark I seen another problem in orphan in the encryption with the parameters of the encryption separating these two in in context rather than debating its if you have a node in between that wants to check it for instance integrity and it doesn\u0027t have the parameters of how the integrity was complete just have a context that doesn\u0027t have because it wasn\u0027t part of the trusted parameter as the nodes and then we can do it and we can forward the corrupted when there\u0027s even though Vic would be able to check for integrity on we could have stopped the propagation so I think it\u0027s interesting to this approach is if I understand just you still can derive the parameter of the encryption on the integrity using at the security station they did right it\u0027s all embedded independent so well in this case it would be all embedded in the bundle but in in in concept that security Association block or contacts definition block would be optional and in your case if it were not there and that information were not there then Waypoint nodes for example could not do integrity checks and throw out bad data early reviews pros and cons in both ways and check out on we are out of time so okay Dino Stephen but there\u0027s just very quickly and yeah maybe like so you "

    "text": "can take all the parameters away from all the plaster you have if you break up a cipher texts and it\u0027s one it\u0027s one encryption and has one Nance that\u0027s one thing but if you\u0027re calling the the the modes each time separately for a bunch of blocks that may you kinda happen on separately with each one it\u0027s like a ESG CN for example right yeah yeah so you can\u0027t always kind of point unless you want to have like a whole so then you\u0027re gonna have a whole boatload of of these sort of security definitions and at that point you actually you\u0027ve actually increased the amount of data in the bundle because you\u0027re tracking all of that plus the extra block types and so on right but it\u0027s but the in that diagram it kind of gives the impression that you can kind of hide all the parameters in one place where this is not always true and it depends on block sizes operation and the other point being is that in cases where all the cipher suite parameters do happen to line up the spec allows you to stack security results in the one block so you\u0027re not having multiple blocks in that case anyway so there\u0027s no so my recommendation is we we template addthis just to see what it would look like I think we\u0027ve gotten a couple of examples here as to what could be problems with that the question to the working group and what can certainly oppose something to the list is is this something that is valuable in any way or no and we should go back to as we had it in be pset version seven and and the two comments that I heard make me feel like this is an interesting experiment but it\u0027s not something that we would want to standardize share hat on we\u0027re under a lot of pressure to actually get documents finished we have yet to finish anything and I know we\u0027re waiting on the convergence layers but I would be nervous about saying well let\u0027s rescind BP SEC with some exciting new ideas because we\u0027ve come up with them while we were waiting to finish it it might be something with my pragmatic hat on you could retrofit this by introducing a new cipher suite id of and now we do in Direction blocks into somewhere else I\u0027d like to cost us an extra integer or an extra field in our seaboard block but that I think might be better than stalling this for another 1224 months that would be not the desired outcome yeah [Music] we\u0027re at a time if you have some know that the last remark was this was a comment that came back from the CC SDS we said that we would present it we thought a way to present it would be to come up with the draft so if anyone wanted to read it they would be able to give review you have read it and and gave an implementation of it and then came back with some review so in that "
