    "text": "Neil hi thanks um this is slowly coales saying I appreciate it um I I just wanted to quickly talk about the nursing of identities and quote-unquote companies um I don't think I so dick talked about identities being unique that's a good idea but verifiable I I think verifiable and and the notion that there are only companies is is too restrictive um and so what they need is some sort of I'll call it cryptographic coherence or something I mean there needs to be a way for an identity to establish a reputation and continue you know proving that it's who it started off being and others can comment on it and refer to it so I you know I just don't want us to lock us lock us into companies are the only things that can make statements and you have to find them in Dunn Brad's Creed or whatever um and certainly I I love Steve's comment that you're a registration policy could say we're only going to deal with people that we can find in you know some other external database um and then I just wanted to come back to this notion which is raised in the chat and or in the notes and I'm not sure if we've pinned it down it seems very critical to me to well I I think multiple entities actors uh issuers or whatever need to be able to show up in a certain feed so the feed isn't uniquely identified by you know the identity of uh of the statement the issuers of the statements posted on the feed so is anybody disagree and think that a feed has to only come from a single Source because if it can then how do we coordinate different feeds that all reference the same artifact thanks"

    "text": "that can't be restricted to One Source because the idea here is that suppliers of all types are going to be registering their info in skit or at least that's one use case and they are not going to be the same entity obviously yeah so so just to jump in I wrote that note and I wrote it specifically to agree with you two there are there are implications of some of the technical chat that's been happening that would stick it to one person and I think that's a bad thing to restrict to so I think we're all if if only one thing comes out of that this meeting we're agreed on that one thank you thank you so much um I want to respond to Steve uh because he raised a couple of good questions um I think uh in the meanwhile after this discussion I think the feed should be more let's just should be a string should be unique uh so an application or profile should Define whatever it wants to stick in there I also think that the other idea that Steve you raised is like if you want to have more um information you can stick it into into the claims uh and as a kind of a name value pay us and and we have that capability to enhance sort of the structure so that makes also sense to me in also your statement about the identity and Ray mentioned I think he was mentioned earlier that um starting out with um for the issue identity with the the did web uh uh it's like a good idea um so so that's what I would do so dick thank you yogeshia I want to clarify something that Neil said because I I disagree with him uh we we were talking"

    "text": "about the ntia work um and identification we didn't limit it to just companies uh because there's a ton of Open Source software that's been written by individuals and so they need to have unique identifiers as well and so the concept between behind identification was not you know strictly limited to being companies but being companies or email addresses that could be used to represent Unique Individuals and those are verifiables you as you know that you could you know send an email to uh to an address and if it's not valid it gets bounced so you know you you they are verifiable in that sense so I just want to clear up it supports the concept is to support companies as well as individuals thank you thank you hi uh I know this is slightly off topic but we are coming close to the hour so I think we last last Monday we had agreed to kind of resolve the pull requests open but I just checked this uh still the pull request opened from Hannah's so are we going to progress this and discuss this during this remainder of the meeting or what is the state has maybe you can check some light little later thank you Hans do you want to take that out of my my card yeah in the risk of jumping the queue uh Steve um yeah the so the one of the issues was that um there was this other PR that was accepted and so it created some merge conflicts which need to be resolved um first uh because the I think Antoine's or"

    "text": "thanks what I know we're getting close to the end but uh I guess uh he just brought something up that I thought was a maybe a good idea and that is it might be useful to use the same architecture that they use with the did web where they have another document that defines the feed if you will and then that would be included in the skit instance as another reference so inside this then by instance I mean uh statement um or or submission so the header would be the I guess key ID would go to the did web document and then the feed would potentially go to another document like that that would identify the feed so when you submit it you could you you wouldn't have you know you could have you would submit what it is it's the same thing as saying this is the product but I'm just saying to to relieve the pressure on this it might be okay to have it be a reference to another document versus just the information right there okay thanks and uh good meeting yeah I gotta drop so uh thanks everybody thanks yeah we'll we'll get these things written down more formally for next week I think there'll be something to review I think we've got some good good agreement here so thanks yeah I think that'll help having a written written about submissions thank you thanks folks thanks take care guys"
