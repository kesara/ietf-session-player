So, Let's go through, through that. Next slide. So MLR search is stands for multiple loss ratio search.

The the device on the test in our case are applications that are sharing servers. So, the servers through the the systems on the test are but clearly multi talented. So, the EUTs are subject to interference and the the way that, that throughput search, you know, it it needs to deal with with that, specifically in the presence of, noise from noisy neighbors or or operating system.

Next slide. So the way that MLR search deals with it it improves or reduces greatly the execution time. We're using the, the the concept of a presenting targets So The preceding targets are different than the final targets, and they they converge to the final target. And, And we also, use, various tricks, to arrive quickly to the interesting uh-uh origin. Something with a pre initial trials. The DOT and STT is characterized by, as I mentioned earlier, as spectrum of performance, noiseless, performance, and one of the spectrum and was full on the other, and the actual, DUT measurement problem or DUT initiative measurement problem is reduced by estimate noiseless, part of that performance spectrum.

There would have a number of different, configurable parameters and which, which, again, improved profitability, And I think for the for the rest, they seem be quite obvious. We we do user users can configure multiple, search goals with different configurable loss ratios. So we we use 2 main ones non drop, non drop rate.

So there is, yellow color which is is finding values related to 0 loss. And, there is a gray color, which is related to the values related to loss of 0 point 5%. And, one of the important, consequences is that you can see that this this This type of results is, not very sensitive to the differences between the configurations So this is one of the reason why no zero loss ratios are good goals because it makes the results stable even if, some datas are different.

So maybe let's talk about the next one, from the left, this is a change Well, the most important change is that the final trials are not required to to be 60 seconds long. But there still needs to be data equivalent to 60 seconds. In this case, it means point. 60 trials each having only one second. In this particular case, it is interesting, that the performance, I've reached, actually, by the Dow this means that for this particular duty, the length of the trial is not very like, it is not making results. Worse if you are running longer trials is that, makes the results worse is if you run multiple trials. The conclusion is that this particle of duty is likely to those buckets at the start of the trial. Because of some memory caching or whatever.

We can do other changes, so you can see the duration improves nicely and, as expected, the average of this orange dots, goes slightly up. Because there is smaller number of chances for a trial to get non zero loss. And that final, on the far right, this configuration uses exceed ratio which is the configuration attributable to that allows some trials to exceed this loss that is configured and still be considered good if there is enough trials that do conform to the ratio. So, in this case, the exit ratio is 50%. What is expected, is, that's, orange dots go nicely up because, of course, now you can have multiple mostly trials, and it's still that some good results. Also, what is expected is that the standard deviation of those orange dots is smaller than before this makes the results more repeatable. What is also interesting that the duration, of the search also is slightly smaller average and, smaller standard deviation, which is a very good and basically, the Right?

So if you are considering some specific protocol or young model, to for the configuration of the tester or It's my proprietary solutions. So since I was not specifying the draft. So I'm curious about that. Yeah. From my point of view, the integration between controller and measure error can be formalized and, I think it can be doable, but the integration between, manager and controller is not as clear because there are, many possibilities for optional arguments. Basically different libraries can implement different option. I have to be able to the most, the best example of that is, the goal with some implementations, may use absolute difference in performance from the implementation may use a relative difference and will be hard to create something that is, formal, but still allowing"

It's a bit strange. I I cannot really adjust tone. I don't know what's what's going through, but, you can go to the next slides. Okay. So this is just the swipe of the hardware platform. Which we previously had as the only reference design. And if you go to the next two slides, they're just, evolution of that. So this is adding a timing module which is important because you can have a device under test that does not allow a WUPAK connection, if you want to just measure one direction, then you need precise timing. So we assume that the timing will be, precise. And, we we have not put any anything in the modules that, that has to do with configuring the timing.

So, If you are familiar or not, you can look at this tree diagram carefully. And, See what we we have changed here. If you walk into the traffic analyzer side on the left, The test frame filter. Container contains, a mask and a data. And those are hexadecimal representation of the buckets. Which can provide you with a flexible way to to configure, to A really detailed type of filter. But in the same way, very simple and not involving any protocol specific discussions and, complexity in terms of agree on something.

Which which allows to to get, latency on each test frame and keep sequence. So if you if you're using a static type, then it would not change anything in that frame. That's what we specify.

Look into the command line representation of that that you run. So a lot of people are used to programming tests using, string based command line based interfaces. The good thing with the young model is that you can convert automatically from the model and serial wise, command line, which is deterministic you you don't need to develop. So this is what we are using, actually, when we're writing test cases So In this case, this is the new solution for specifying, filter on the test frames, and you can see that we specify a type of filter which is the only support in the draft that can be further extended with identity specified by third parties."

Against the NetComm server, implementing the model, by controlling a gate level simulation of the synthesizable traffic generator and the traffic analyzer course in Cocoa TV. You you, you, have a simulation time for that in nanoseconds. So what Wait. Is interesting is that we started with complete, and standard RFC 2544 benchmark. And if you're wondering how much it takes for a 10 q by Tetranet device, That's how many nanoseconds it takes if you don't lose any time, except configuring the registers, waiting. Reading status and so on. So it takes 1a half milliseconds. To perform a standard RFC benchmark for the device But notice that place. Notice that we used bogus, sent you white ethernet pit, beat, to actually simulate the data plan in real time. Because simulation takes time, But you can achieve on a laptop more than 10 q byte of simulation time. So if you say that you're 1 gigabit device is actually a 10 qbit device.

And the question is to answer is that but ranges can be used Of course, we have some, I'd be at the Sanjay's in version 4 and version 6 is, for benchmarking so we can use these ranges And the even harder question is what kind of ranges should be used. So if you use only a few IP addresses, maybe it's not enough to distribute the traffic, if you use too many IP addresses, you will have a problem that, the IRR, ARP, in this edition, in in version 4, or NDP network this call is according, ipv6 tables of the, growth to a large and it will, just Dickies the performance.

So the the offers we think that, the office is stable now with after this merging, and we would like to to go through adoption process. The the 2 previous drafts, received a considerable amount of comments and sales. So now the result everything integrated on on just this this unique or common, let's say, document some of us, like, buddies and myself, we have shared the that we already have the test following this by much much marking methodology. I can also confirm that, there is some some plans for going for the for coming months in in Telefonica Lab for continuing doing so. So now we will take this merge document as as reference basis for for this. And, yeah, basically, we consider that the adoption of the working group I adoption of the document by the working group would also, facilitate a faster, you know, that that that following this kind of methodology between different operators. We also discussed internally with an suggested that once adopted also to be sending a spring working group, so to socialize the the air in mmmm let's say the, in, in, in, in the working groups, working around the cement routing. Also an option could be, The Semler Automation 6 operations working group. We finally use this form. So, but, but anyway, clearly, to the spring working group to, to take this and, surrealize with them and also receive feedback from from that front. And that's all for my sector. Thanks. Thank you, Louis. Any feedback? Any comments? Okay. Yeah. Go ahead,"

But I think we we have reviewed it several times So I think nothing should prevent us from adopting it. So I recommend the chairs to to initiate an adoption code after this, meeting is over. On the middle east, I mean, Thank you, Gabor. Any other comments Okay. Yeah, regarding the adoption, I will cast with the Sarah, And, yeah, probably we can have some follow-up after the this meeting Thank you. Let's go at Carlos is not connected. So I think Jean Yeah. It's not Bye. Okay. Thanks for chair. And, so Carls is not here. So, like, on behalf of the officer, present this, draft and the topic about, you know, characterization and the benchmarking densibility for powering the networker device. And next So, so the background, actually, you know, the very impact, you know, on an edit, network infrastructure, you know, not a trivial. So ensure that energy efficiency become more and more important for operator to operate their network. So"

The first is operator so they can get as a energy efficiency, visibility so they can, you know, and can develop, you know, energy business strategy for vendor, actually, they can test the energy efficiency for their own device. And to meet, you know, operate as a requirement. So, for, for this benchmark work, actually, we target 2, objective the first is assessing which system perform better. Over a set of where to find the scenario. So this is, more focused in a stages. The second is the major, the contribution of subsystem to the overall system, performance, And, actually, for for, for this, object that we haven't touched in chart, but, we you know, catch this in, in a second phase, the current stage we to, you know, compare. Energy shipping, if you can save for innovative device. Next, So the technology terminology is that in this draft, actually, we, actually have 3 key terminologies defining this draft the first is a total weighted capacity of the interface and, 2nd is a total weighted power. And, the the 30 is the energy efficiency ratio you can see tolerology actually has the 3 metrics. You can see, the first two metrics actually can be used to, you know, derive the 3rd metric anti efficiency. So each metric will have their own mismatic, formula So this, actually, you know, based on ETSI, stand out actually, yeah, users and seminar technology,"

Actually, of If you actually, under the normal, workload for example, you have work loaded 20% or 30% or 50%. You choose to measure the maximum power drove by the devices. So in in most cases, it doesn't, you know, accurate, reflect the the real actual power to be used, so So what you need to, you know, define some, you know, the test procedure hasn't mastered. So formula that consists them, market method, so in this, banking master, we need to consider various different workload variations. So typically, they will choose a 0% or 30% and 100% in many you know, if we reference, you know, ETSI, standards, also, we consider different test conditions. So so one example, since this, library environment, so we may said it never, temperature, you know, to specifically temperature value, ranging. Maybe we can set you know, the the some other, like, a community and, Or, animal atmosphere, 10 prayer, this this kind of test condition. So based on these, you know, test conditions you said, actually, you can, you know, make a the the main result can be repeatable, you know, each, each person or each, you know, testor can, can, you know, get the same results. The new metric we use here is energy efficient ratio. So you can see So they can calculate, based on, 2 match records. So this is already, we can use total weighted capacity of the interface divided by the total weighted and power. So,"

Usually, they depend on the network device type. Or locational devices. So in this case, we usually consider, for example, their location, is in the call network or in the access Networker, the the equipment could be the switch or could be, the, router Yeah. Next. So, test the methodology. We actually need to set a, you know, test the environment for this, So the you can see these are simpler test the, environment set up, actually, Usually, we, require this, device on the test, the new connect to the both, tester and also power, meter. For power meter, only a major internal, energy, consumption of the device. But, you know, for, devices on the test that they also know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, do you see paid actually significant amount of the heat actually for this, you know, external, hit with didn't account, actually, in this test setup. Next, so So how to make, you know, benchmark your results are repeatable? Actually, we need to characterize the traffic and the devices. So the idea is, you know, to portrait the, the traffic, or portrait the the, the device, you know, for for traffic, actually, we, consider, traffic load And, we synced in a traffic load away."

This is the the the traffic, carried the right thing. We can, currently consider by the we do receive, some comments, yeah, we need to consider more, factors, device, the characterization, actually, currently, we consider, like, interface type, if we don't know whether it is an obliger interface or packet interface, And, and also if it is, you know, opticker, device, actually, you need to consider the the type of the connector or transceiver for example, it could be the fiber optical transceiver module. And so these are, you know, really, you know, Poetry is a device that you really, test in, in this kind of, you know, library randomness or make a, you know, result of my currently, all repeatable, And, in addition, we also consider, the 9 card capability for, you know, whether the 9 card how many pause have to commit supporting the, 9 card or the aggregated anyway, for each 9 car.

So, so to save time, actually, I I stop here. Yeah. Sangamo is in. Thank you, Jean. Yeah. All these comments, I think that if there is some caution on the impact, Middle East, we also need to cross pause on the benchmarking source. So benchmarking working with people is aware of Yeah.

Next slide, please. And, also, there is some previous, working group document, which has been, paired, but we find it is, useful. Because it has a defined EVAP and capability benchmarking. And the the topology used in the document is showed here. It's it is composed of multiple nodes to provide the European service. And, for our document, the European service is, an important type of European up VPN solution, and it is one of the, VPN stories we want to transport you through a services network.

It it the the draft is intended because sorry, because I I couldn't read yet. It's intended for interoperability or it will be a single vendor scenario, what we are trying to, to benchmark. It's only one vendor. It's not, interoperations. It's just the capability benchmarking. Okay. Yeah. And and are you considering in order to facilitate the reproducibility of the of the benchmarking methodology across different vendors. And so guidance as well, for instance, in terms of, the IP addresses to be used or it it it it or on topology and all this So that that will be included in the document?
