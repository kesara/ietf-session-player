John\u0027s may remember the size of the circuit but I seem to remember that when we went to Stockholm the first time they actually doubled the capacity coming into the country in order to deal with the ietf yeah it so it was like 56 kbps additional line was impressive at the time right so they doubled the country\u0027s capacity nobody said we weren\u0027t Johnny Appleseed or Johnny applesauce you know the capacity and had that make some more the good news is on site I think we\u0027re actually pretty close but I think the point that Cullen made obliquely is much more important and that is the ability to have remote participation be effective is going to become more and more important for the ITF as we try and broaden their base and as we try and make sure that we begin to bring that into things like hackathons and other places for the kinds of interaction or both WebRTC and github and local participation or going on at once so it actually suggests that rather than focusing on local participation that the NOC team as it\u0027s looking at these focus on what it would take to make remote participation work or double the numbers we have now and make sure that if we can reach that without hotel network we\u0027re good to go but I\u0027m guessing that if we can\u0027t the delta between what we need to do to make the remote participation work and what we\u0027re doing now for local participants isn\u0027t high enough to work Ted I\u0027d like to follow up on one piece of that my "

John\u0027s was the question of how many people here are sort of key men and women with respect to their companies and how much does having a good network here allow them allow your company will let you come here and do the work as opposed to being there so and that\u0027s both the hotel rooms and here so I don\u0027t I\u0027m not working for anybody directly anymore so it doesn\u0027t matter for me but you might want to think about that so sorry Warren Kumari so a number of people have mentioned stuff like know the ability to do meetings in their room something which I think we often forget is many of us also call our significant others from our room um sure one mentioned you know he sits in his room does email you have a new kid I\u0027m assuming that you also you know do video conferences with your kid on the cellular network okay I mean it hasn\u0027t worked for me and expensive but what\u0027s for you okay so Jason Livengood two comments one on the dog food question and I may take the pet analogy here I do think that we are good at eating on dog food but it\u0027s almost like we\u0027re dogs kept by the king in the palace and it\u0027s super special and it doesn\u0027t resemble the dog food that all the rest of the dogs outside the palace walls eat so it might be a question of like how premium is dog are you taking this hunger games and then the second is on the security "
