    "text": "so here just quickly the different elements so what is new is that now of course you can compress packet on the link but here we have a proxy that allows you to answer to the Peaks so the pink so in the middle here you have the core Chic and so if a Chic message has been received by the kaushik it will answer two Echo requests directly and it will not be sent to the device but it is specified for a certain period of time on when this period of time have expired so the core Chic will not answer to a request anymore so that's the easy way to find if a device is alive without sending unreal P1 some information so to do this we add to the rule an action parameter sorry but when they see your flow if if the in the second case could there be a bit or something which I try sending to the client to the device because the device may be alive and depending on the lp1 technology it might be possible to send the packet to the device I mean I understand it's good for the moment I think it will need to have another uh action because the current action is to do this and but one one exception maybe we can we can add an action but say a proxy or sent but it's not the case right now but that's a good uh good idea personally my next meeting has just started so um okay so but yes uh so era it's uh so what we have done here is for example you have a device that sends a message and the message generate an icmp message somewhere on the internet so the corsic"

    "text": "receive an icmp message and here what we propose is to add the to recompress the message that is Echo by scmp and to send to the to the device the error icmp message that is compressed on the payload that is also compressed using the rule that the Corsica so this means that we have two new ma that say match Rule and much or reverse match rule that means that we are using uh matching in the same direction or in the opposite direction and same thing we can send a compressed things or reverse compress no yeah if I can suggest uh you know there is very little traffic coming from the device and what I'm really concerned is if because we don't have I mean that's part of the architectural discussions but we don't have an order for the rules so you never know if you will compress it the same way as it was comprised so what you're setting back is probably not the same bits as we don't care we don't care because the device will use a rule because here in the compress here you have the rule ID you will not know what he said and the prime might be related to what he sounds it works maybe we can discuss if you say me to go fast and to answer okay okay it will be difficult but we can discuss offline yes okay uh and the last last thing is that we introduce also some icmp message error that can be generated by the kaushik for example we can use uh type zero so it's error code three it means that us not found it means that a package arrives to the core Sheikh and it didn't find any rule for any devices so uh here we send this message if the device is found but there is no matching rule we say that the port is not found and I think we don't have to introduce"

    "text": "new icmp messages because it can be a security issue for example to say oh I am a poor device that is on the lp1 network so don't attack me and here it's regular messages so it's better and another one that has not been put in the draft right now but when you receive a too big packet and your fragmentation rules cannot carry this large packet then we can send an ICM pip to Big um message and so I just put here some example that is derived from open cheek and in the second column on the bottom you see the icmpv6 payload and here we have the matching operator that is used and we send nothing but it means that if the matching upper if we don't find any reverse rules then we will not apply this Rule and the last column you have the action proxy ping and the value that for example here it it works for 10 seconds also many many thanks and I guess I have to abruptly end this meeting because for some of us the next I mean we're already late so um yeah thank you so much all and we'll continue all those discussions on the mailing list bye-bye okay thanks bye-bye thank you bye foreign"
