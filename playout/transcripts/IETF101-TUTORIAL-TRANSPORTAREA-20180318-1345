    "text": "for your network monitoring purposes in some cases there are also boxes in the network that would change these bits so for example the initial sequence number is sometimes to stay with this example sometimes overwritten because that gives you a few way you can put additional information in or if you for some reason don\u0027t want to support a certain TCP option you can actually just strip it from the TCP soon and it will not be used there are other use cases where you have a good reason to rewrite stuff as well so what we see more recently is that we have a increasing deployment of HTTPS or TLS in this case so what this change is that you cannot see the higher layer headers anymore you cannot see any HTTP information anymore but you can still see the transport layer header I wish we\u0027re still not meant for the network but still provide sometimes very useful information however if you if you modify and change these things that can also sometimes have negative impact for example even if you as Network don\u0027t want to support a certain TCP option like it might never get deployed right and we developed it for a purpose and there are also privacy implications so for example the time steam timestamp option is a good example you can actually basically if you look at the time ssin option you can match up which connections belong to the same host because they have the same clock drift for example these kind of things are also critical what\u0027s neither never not possible anymore in this case it\u0027s of course deep packet inspection inspection so why is there why is it so horrible or why do we actually want to encrypt more than this and there are two good reasons which I kind of already mentioned right now one is really privacy concerned but the other one is also ossification so we have had especially in transport area a lot of discussions over the last couple of years we wanted to change something and then this cushon ended up and no you can\u0027t change it because there\u0027s something applied in the network that will not interoperate with this that will just drop drop packets if you change this bit or or you have to have a fallback if this option gets dropped or dropped from TCP so it really made our protocol development more complicated and sometimes and sometimes it\u0027s even impossible to to innovate on the protocols anymore so it does help us also in the in the process if we try to at least secures information in a way that we can still change the meaning modify it on an end-to-end layer later on the second big point is really privacy and fingerprinting so actually this will not be fully solved by just encrypting some of the transmitted information but it\u0027s one step in this direction so what we have in quick basically right now is "
