So we're asking for that based on Moheed's proposal the current REV of the document has been updated to use a sub-domain which makes a bit more sense So every eat method has its subdomain T, for example, T-TLS.E ttls.epe.eep.arpa, or ttls.eep.arpa, or T-TLS.Eep.Aep.Rpa, and then the eat method can do whatever the heck it wants with the username portion. There is provisions for registries for this once the IAB has agreed to allow us to use EEP. ARPA, the subdomain registry and the username registries are moved over under IETF change control and EMU, and then the idea is everyone can use us to do whatever kind of provision they want and have actual signaling of existing what they want from provision I think that's pretty much it.

So I suggest you start looking into how you would change the UI for Android because as soon as you put it into, as soon as you give the diffs to uni, it's going to appear in Android in probably six months from now.

So just a quick recap, what we are trying to do We are trying to leverage FIDO keys for Wi-Fi login primarily but of course you can use it wherever you use EAP EAPTLS-based protocol with two phases, so first the TLS handshake and then within the DLS tunnel, the FIDER authentication with different options for the server to send authentication parameters like if there is a requirement for user presence or user verification or if you can use silent authentication and the configuration because that's a big problem in TTLS P if you can use silent authentication and the configuration because that's a big problem in TTLS or all these methods especially in bring your own device environments"

I would tell me phone to use the pass key that I have already registered for dfn.de, and then I would use that next slide slide So this is again the protocol flow that we designed right now So first the TLS and shake, the server sends a request to the client, the client request a FIDO signature, and then we have the option for discoverable credentials or if no discoverable credentials are available only then the device will send a username in the inner tunnel the server will send back a list of public key identities The device can then request a fight signature with that and then the device can respond with the signature from the FIDO key and the server can check that. Okay, next slide So what happened since Brisbane? most work didn't go into the text and the document, but more in the proof of course implementation, but we have changed a little bit. So first, of course, the work was adopted as a result of the region rechartering, the EMU working group thanks for that.

Most text around the actual Fido authentication, so what do I send to the Fido Authenticator? What is exactly the string that the authenticate? then signs? That's still to do because we are there a little bit dependent on some externals to help us understand what we need to do in order to do it safely. Next slide So I talked about it. I have a bit of running code. I am still working on a complete proof of concept implementation, but there is a functioning implementation that uses host AP So host APD on the server site, WPA supplicant on the client side and it is working for discoverable credentials and I have for the registration because the registration of the fact phytokies is not in scope for our spec a very simple web app application where you can register your phyto key and then puts the credential in a SQLIP database and the host APD then reads this SQLI database and gets the public key from that.

This is an interesting part because the web auth end, specification explicitly states that for hashing the client data that the author the WebOthN specification explicitly states that for hashing the client data that the authenticator should sign, they use SHA-2 and that's specific in Web of N. They can't use a different hashing algorithm than Shar2 but as n. They can't use a different hashing algorithm than shah two. But as we will see in the next presentation from Ellen, using a fixed hashing algorithm, in a protocol is probably a bad idea So we probably shouldn't have a fixed hash algorithm in the spec but have crypto agility That's something that we need to look into how we can negotiate it algorithm or if we maybe even can leverage some things that we already negotiated in TLS And then the bigger issue is that platform authenticators don't do CTAB We changed that a bit when we have the discussion about the Charter in Brisbane So again, there we would have to look into it If you have a platform authenticator, then silent authentication would still work or not.

I think none of the platform authenticators already allow silent authentication I've asked some Fido people and apparently there is no space rule against it, but they just didn't implement it because web often did always requires user interaction so at least user presence. So I guess that's why they implemented it that way Yeah. I guess I don't think the platform authenticators should even implement silent authentic because I suspect that there are a large quantity of websites that don't check the user presence flag.

So Peresh and I, we looked at kind of what are areas where in EEP that, you know, can actually leak privacy or can divulge personal information.

Now many of you must be already familiar with the work that is being done in the privacy pass working Group and a document that they have generated to define the architecture and an issuance protocol and authentication scheme So what privacy powers token offers here is cryptogram generated, unfurgeable and"

    "text": "uninkable proof of attestation So there are some keywords in that statement cryptographically, which means there are some cryptography functions that are ensuring that the privacy pass token is providing the required unlinkability So the cryptography functions that have been employed are OPRF, WS, sort of random functions using primary order groups RFC 9497 And then the RSA blind signatures, RFC 9 9474 So for the first one, the OPRF, that offers privately verifiable privacy pass token and RSA blind signature offers publicly verifiable will signature using the issuers public key And we probably already know that RSA blind signatures has been already instrumental in supporting or implementing privacy preserving voting system and digital payment systems. So it's the same technology that has been used here And then the next thing is the server client and issuer client and a tester server unlinkability guarantee. Now privacy passports next thing is the server client and issuer client and attester server unlinkability guarantee. Now privacy pass token offers all these features which is why it makes a perfect choice to be used in EPP for wired, wireless and VPN network access with anonymity anonymity So let's dive into our at high level the EPP works And then here I'm showing the issuance is occurring at the time of the EPP session but that doesn't necessarily be the case The issues can happen beforehand"

So EPPT is always performed inside a tunneled EIP method Just like privacy pass token offers authentication scheme which is HTTP over T TLS. Similarly, here, EPPT is being encapsulated inside a TLS tunnel provided by the TNEP method, which is why we see that padlock there. So once we have a TLS tunnel established, EPPT gets invoked It starts with the simple identity request and response. The response has to ensure it is privacy friendly The realm in the identity is only used for making a decision on what chat challenge should be thrown at the peer and how the redemption of the token should be performed And it's a simple challenge response protocol. So once the identity is determined, the server will send a challenge And a token challenge structure in the challenge message is what actually takes the peer, what is the type that it supports whether it is OPRF or RSA blind signature and what is the issue that the server trust so it makes sure the client or peer gets the token issued bound to this challenge from the issuer it trust"
  },

    "startTime": "00:50:00",
    "text": "and then there are two optional information inside the token challenge The first one is the the the original info And then origin info is something you can think of I mean in case of privacy pass token it's easy because it's made for the proprietary web services, but then if it's a authentication for layer two there is no host name involved here. So we could use the subject alt name extension with the DNS name value in the server certificate as the origin info. And then we can make sure that token generated is bound to that origin only and then the second optional member of that structure is the redemption context and the redemption context is something that server can use to distinguish the different EP sessions for a client so that it can be used to prevent double spending of the token token Now when the challenge is received by the peer, it has to get the token issued or it must have a token issued before and cached before it can respond to that challenge. So the issue is works has to get a token issued or it must have a token issued before and cashed before it can respond to that challenge. So the way the issuance works here is it has to go through some attention because the issuer trust the attest and attester based on the attester it performs with the client who guarantees that this is a legitimate client and it is making a token request and that token request gets honored by the issue only after the attestation is successfully completed so issuer trust attester attest trust client it performs the attestation and post-attestation attestation, attester is just proxing the token request to the issuer and getting the token response back to the client"

Now, the draft says that attestation is out of scope of this document, and you can take a look at the documents where the attestation is described by Privacy Pass architecture Essentially it means is, you show me some proof or evidence that you are worthy of this attestation. It could be you are running on a trusted hardware or you have a valid application layer account or you just saw a capture. Now whatever it is, the attester has to be happy with that. And post its verification, it is ready to issue or no proxy your issuance request to the issuer and get a token issue And once the token is issued, the EPPTPR presents that to the EPPD server, and server is using depending on the what type in the token challenge, whether it is OPR, or RSA blind signature, it verifies the PRF output or RSA blind signature using RSAPSS signature algorithm, and then it passed the verdict here whether the token is valid or not valid and then sends back the Ipsuccess or if failure to the EPP year So next slide So let us know if you have any questions, any questions please take a look at the draft and please provide us your valuable feedback and please guide us how do you actually go about getting this adopted in the EMU working group.

Um, the, uh, I guess, so when you're looking at the, attestation that's happening out of band is that happening over a separate network interface or? in your, yeah so you're over a separate network interface or within your uh yeah so um your that's a very valid question so you've got to have internet connectivity to reach out to issue via a tester and get our testation done, but then at the time of the eB authentication, you may or may not have the internet connectivity on some other interface, which is why the cached tokens is the way out here But then it doesn't technically stop you from getting the token issued if you have actually a mobile phone with the cellular connectivity. And if you could prove that you are worthy of issuance of token through some attestation process you can get a token issued over cellular interface or on the any uh pc or mac you can use ethernet interface to do that. Okay, and the other thing I think it'll be real important to get feedback from Privacy Pass with Revere, because the kind of implications of how this works and what information is leaked is, is be real important to get feedback from Privacy Pass. We're revered because the kind of implications of how this works and what information is leaked is not necessarily easy to to analyze so I know you're presenting later so, yeah. Thank you Alan yeah I just had a couple of quick comments I posted to the last I'm overall the document seems fairly clear There's just a little bit of vagueness about the outer TLS. And they're could be more information there. I think that would affect a lot of the privacy implications Yeah, we purpose kept that outside of the, because there's there's multiple ways, like depending or whether or not your public or private in the public case, you know, uh,"

All right. Thank you, gentlemen Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Elliot Yeah, this is Elliot again What are the next steps here, chairs? If these guys wanted adopted, what would the path be? So I think first we'd have to coordinate with Privacy Pass uh working group with fortunately I'm a chair there as well But to understand what the privacy implications are here because it's not completely clear to me just from you know looking at it briefly what what implications are if this, if this is um, functionally different than the existing use cases and needs to be analyzed in a different way. Because we'd like, you know, we don't want to go forward with something that's not going to have the privacy privacy the existing use cases and needs to be analyzed in a different way.

And if they want to do that, then we, you know recharter with this item. And then move forward. Does that mean? sense? It does. I do Okay, it does make sense to me. So the think we're starting with you presenting it for the pass, right? Then what I'm concerned about is, and then nothing happens, right? Because everybody goes, okay, that sounds cool, or, you know, maybe there are a couple of issues here we can tweak. But so there needs to be like a way to drive the process, so maybe Paul, you might need your help on it oh there you are okay So maybe Paul you could at least make sure that things don't drop dead because of bureaucratic failure to know, failure to communicate. But that shouldn't be a problem, right, Joe? Shouldn't be I mean, I think we I think, then we come back here, we actually you do a call for adoption at that point, or or what happens next assuming that Priv Pass is okay with all of this this So let me just bring up. Like, if this false between the facts of two working groups, please come to me and will make the working groups communicate. And in this case, we'll be really, weird if that's not the case, because Joe is in both the working groups. But yeah. So I probably expect the working groups communicate and in this case it will be really weird if that's not the case because Joe is in both the working groups but yeah so i mean i would fully expect this to come back to emu right because it's an eep method What I, the other comment I want to just say as an aside is I think it's a little weird that we have to go through"

I'm also not a big fan of rechartering for every little small thing, but that's how some of it is done. In general it's just like, you know, the things you're working on first, try to finish that before doing new work. And rather that is enforced by rechartering often or by recharging once and just keeping track of milestones, or if we're getting rid of milestones, doing it some other way that's basically what we need to do, right? Like, we don't need people to go from shiny thing to shiny thing without finishing it it I don't think it was a problem here. Yeah this to, if we move forward with this would be an EMU, I would think. But would, you know, require pretty close coordination with Privacy Pass and some cross-group review right? But I think it's probably the hopefully most of the details are have to do with the EAP method and not with Privacy Pass itself, right? because if it turns out to be other way around then like we need to then there's probably something wrong Right.

Pub hybrid that has to be defined, I think that has to be part of the INA registry as well. To carry the power key, which is basically the concatenation of the PQC Chem and the traditional keys and it will basically calculate the, it will carry the encap encapsulated key, which is the traditional chem algorithm as well as the PQ Chem algorithm and the kdf forward secrecy attribute needs to be up updated to ensure that it has the basically the PQC Chem message as well and it will be included the hybrid key would be included first in the IP request to indicate a higher priority than the traditional KDF. Moving on yeah this is the basically the new new attribute that that would be defined, and it would contain the public key and for the EP request and the need response it would be the encapsulated key, which is the concatenation of the traditional key and the ciphertext from PQC from the EPIR And this is basically what would be registered at the I&E sorry INA, sorry.

Yeah, moving on Yeah, now we're quickly we'll go through the PQM versions for IPEC A Prime. Here, we completely remove the ECDHE part and instead we replace with the post-quarant camps completely And yeah, the next one. Yeah. Key and encapsulation mechanisms, as we know them in the definition is pretty generic heads was from the API, from PQC API interface and it's a key generation there's an encapsulation function based on the public key and a ciphertext on a sheer C secret is generated and the decapsulation function calculates the shared secret based on its basically the up secret is generated and the decapsulation function calculates the shared secret based on its uh based on the the basically the uh the peers uh cypher text and its own secret key Yeah, moving on Here, the changes would be from ECDHA pair to the PQM pair and the PQCM Public Key and the Public chem algorithm would be need to be defined.

For example, I mean, HPKA is not specific to I mean, it's hybrid encryption, but it's not specific to hybrid quantum post post-quantum, and classical, right? Why wouldn't you use? the same approach in in both for the you know, pure? chem and for the hybrid chem? I mean, essentially, I mean you can, but I think it would be a, I mean, for H, for the hybrid one, the PQT hybrid one it makes a lot of sense because it has, you know, this inbuilt combiners for basically calculating the PQ, concatenated with the traditional shared secret, but for PQ pure PQC, it feels like an overhead So that's why we didn't want to touch HBK for the P or PQ camps. Because in P or PQC camps, you can just, just do P or PQC cam instead I mean, replacing the traditional algorithms. So you wouldn't need any sort of, any other, basically modes for HPK to operate.
