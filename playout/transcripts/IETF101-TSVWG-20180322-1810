    "text": "him but what your experience was I can try and comment on two of them and firstly I got quite a lot of feedback here when I presented OPSEC from operators who come to the IETF which was useful and that\u0027s been widened into what we currently have in the document outside we had a workshop I got a little bit of feedback there but I\u0027m still looking for more people to provide input the machine learning Rai approach is interesting from both perspectives some people say they have tools which don\u0027t really need much information because basically they will learn everything on packet patterns and they\u0027ll do traffic analysis and loggia gained a lot of the metrics they would have previously have done by just doing all this but then they also point to the variability and the results they get because it\u0027s much more difficult to get predictable results when you have that so maybe that\u0027s not brilliant people who want to digest everything yeah sure that there are also those I\u0027m I don\u0027t really know how to write something about that and also I\u0027m for example with some DDoS mitigation techniques some people use machine learning on sort of the packets that pass by at a snap on the DNS so when it run DNS service they they look into that data and obviously in here the solution approach so it\u0027s not just asking the question but you actually need to understand their approach as well and some approaches may suffer more from encryption than others so it\u0027s a it\u0027s a it\u0027s a tricky business it\u0027s a very tricky business because if you ask any company directly the first answer is we don\u0027t actually need any of this because you have to find a group of people who do the troubleshooting or whatever it is that actually needs a particular element to actually talk to them and that\u0027s usually a smaller number of people in the company and he\u0027s quite hard to locate these people and yet they appear to be the people who keep the network working which is why I drew a picture of the Tube map because you know I\u0027m if they don\u0027t keep the network working quite as well then the network doesn\u0027t work quite as well so inputs please yes I don\u0027t know well I mean I\u0027m operating or dealing with network equipment he stays anymore thank God wish you fun thank you common honey I was gonna say my name is Brian Trammell but we could do this I I think this discussion is interesting was I mean I think it would be wonderful if we had some sort of measurement Jim I think we\u0027ve been around that circle relatively recently in this organization hey I don\u0027t know how to conclude it I think it\u0027s perhaps something we should not try and address in this draft that there are right okay just make that this draft is supposed to be banking what we currently okay so this draft is primarily that we built a whole internet "

    "text": "and we successfully operated it for many decades unknown to us people are actually looking into packets to keep that internet operating how did they do that and what is it they need if that\u0027s one of the ways to add a little header somewhere then that\u0027s okay but really that\u0027s less of important than actually banking what we actually know and what people really are using currently yes I agree I think it would be interesting to look at alternative approaches but that would be a different document no Brian was in the key behind right and now for a real Brian for now hi I\u0027m Colin Perkins oh you think LTP is the solution to this actually yes I do know attention to I don\u0027t remember the RFC number but I ppm last year actually did publish a instrumentation shim for basically for replacing uh stamp and IP ID based measurement in v4 to v6 networks right so that\u0027s probably not applicable um in terms of its efficiency in sort of like the the wide open Internet one could call sort of the quick spin bit a one bit instrumentation shim that\u0027s jammed into the middle of a packet um I actually we\u0027ve gained enough experience with that from and instrumentation standpoint it actually turns out it\u0027s way better than some of the passive TCP stuff that people are actually doing to the point that there was a joke a little earlier in the week that I should write draft trammel TCP em spin and I\u0027ve looked at it enough that I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a joke so I expect that to go somewhere it won\u0027t actually ship but it\u0027s an interesting an interesting way to look at it I think that obviously yes I think that sort of instrumentation shimming makes a lot of sense but some of the discussions that we\u0027ve had in quick might drive us towards sort of different designs for that sort of thing right like so what can we do with very very very few bits per thing and I\u0027ll also draw attention to a talk I gave in MAPP RG I think last time on principles for measure ability and protocol design so if anyone is interested in um sort of working on this and thinking like really hard about how to do this please go have a look at that presentation or the paper behind it and um let\u0027s keep talking I think that as a framing document none of this belongs in this document I did a framing document I think we should um we should definitely adopt this okay um yeah I lost first I\u0027m really interested interested in whether this is a useful collection of stuff and whether we need extra stuff but if it\u0027s a useful collection then we will try and get it "

    "text": "right hi I\u0027m al Morton so I read your draft I\u0027ve seen the presentation a couple of times but I missed a little bit of this so apologies if I repeat anything I think this is a your drafts are really good view of this world that\u0027s changing from the transport side and and that\u0027s that\u0027s an useful scope so this is the ideal place to to take that up I wonder if when you when you say it has costs encryption the encapsulation adding shims and so forth there there\u0027s there\u0027s definitely a cost there it\u0027s very real in terms of the number of bits that fit below the MTU and and and I think that\u0027s a starting point we can probably build on that but we it would be will be really useful to quantify somehow all the complexities let\u0027s call them complexities that are added here and the losses for what we\u0027re getting and I\u0027m happy to read the draft again now that you know we\u0027ve been whipped with the neutrality stick thank you thank you okay so I guess I\u0027m supposed to say something about adoption at this point right it\u0027d be nice to know who\u0027d read it what would we do other people are still here please raise your hand if you\u0027ve read this draft that\u0027s a fair number of Reddit now this point I\u0027m going to put on my sort of process workgroup chair hat observe that Spencer has has demonstrated his long experience as an ad by being out of the room so he can\u0027t be asked it took me really estas experience or took her a little while longer to realize that was also a prudent course of action exactly in all seriousness owl is limping and I hope that limping is unrelated to the draft that [Laughter] I will note warrants call at the plenary last night that the main draft which I\u0027ll put an awful lot time into co-authored Kathleen with Kathleen Moriarty finally made the iesg with the consensus indicator turned off to indicate that they does not represent a coherent a coherent set of views there\u0027s also been way too much fun with the spin "

    "text": "bit in quick times I think I think one of the jokes that I totally transport or view toriel on Sunday was was we may have set a record for amount of time spent discussing one protocol bit my inclination is to is based on the fun that\u0027s been had this week to give the question of what to do with this draft a meeting cycle of meeting cycles worth of soak time encourage people to read it and if a lot of people think it\u0027s valuable maybe eight maybe I get to put on the Kevlar vest and away we go with it hi um Who am I gonna impersonate now David black Trammell the if I may make a friendly amendment to that suggestion um actually riffing off of Warren\u0027s observation that mm encrypt was published without I eat by the is G without IETF consensus I just in because I think I like gory and I like his work and I think he should do more of it um I think that we should aim for the consensus but yet set the yes on this one I always aim for the consensus bit set to yes I\u0027m observe and I\u0027m observing that what happened to Alan Kathleen\u0027s draft was you know I\u0027m quite certain I\u0027m happy to ask that they aim to get that bit set to yes and it was not feasible right so it is that one of the reasons I mean okay we don\u0027t really need to really gate that one of the reasons that that couldn\u0027t happen is because it was basically trying very hard and and I think to the extent that is possible to do so succeeded in being non-pejorative about all of the things that are done and that was not okay with certain people in the community that we were not non-pejorative about some of the things that are currently done in networks I think that by scoping things to the transport layer and to basically look at both sides of this coin which is which is what this how this draft is set up you have two questions and if we focus equally on those two questions I think we can get there but yeah so I would I\u0027m happy to say adoption now I\u0027m happy to say adoption in Montreal um it\u0027s certainly there\u0027s no rush on this these problems aren\u0027t going to like magically go away or get worse tomorrow no these problems aren\u0027t aren\u0027t gonna go away I\u0027m quite happy to discuss adoption Montreal but I think of meetings like what the soak time would be good and I admire your optimism Brian the glass half-empty comment here is middleboxes here we go again notwithstanding that I\u0027m still really keen for people to read this and we\u0027re really keen to find new "
