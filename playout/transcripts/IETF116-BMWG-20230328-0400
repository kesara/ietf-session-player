The purpose of our draft is to make it possible to reuse the well established benchmarking procedures like throughput latency flame slate that we're defining R c twenty five forty four and later. Refining I see about for Version sixth extension technologies So First of all, we we need to enable them to work with Ip versions extensions technologies especially with with the state four ones because if you're just imagine that for example, throughput uses with the traffic and if you want to to confirm Rf forty fourteen with have port numbers. You're not just invent random port numbers because they will not go through the state four six four or four four gateway, especially in the download direction. So we have to do something to to make it work. And we also have some state full, specific procedures to measure but specific measures three six maximum connection establishment rate connection to run rate and connection taking table capacity.

So let me just give you quick reminder about how it works. And and the the main main ideas of our draft. So the first in most similar important thing is that that setup On this slide, you can see the usual two devices the tester and the device And as a device on the test, with state an eighty six for gateway course it could be a stage for ninety four for gateway pay two, but we use the example of the eight six four. It's is not possible to just send through and Gateway the right to left direction, the connections should be initiated in the left right direction is why the left side forth of the tester is called ini, so it can send Ip version six packets through the device under test. And up to measure it can invent any port number combinations? And the device under test, the state where six for gateway just translate them. To ip version four packets and it registers connection information into the connection table. And then the ip version four package it'll arrive to the right side of the tester which is going to responder. This port just it's like the information, the fourth. I mean, source and destination ip address and source and the destination port number. From the Ip version four for test frames, and stores them in the test table, And later on, it will be able to use proper Ip port number combinations from the state table to be able to stand very test frames through the device under test, which belonging to an existing connection."

As I said before, and the connection table of the device that is field also the state table of the responder is filled with eight four. And It is a condition for the your test phase. But these fees be used be the the relief test phase to measure the maximum connection instead rate. And test phase we can perform the classic measurement procedures like P, Latency, etcetera but it must be with the many fees. Which prepare the system. To be able to to perform this procedures as I said. So to to to have a repeatable measurements we ken achieve two x situations that can be easily done. The first one is when auto translate create a new connection, it is the ideal for the much maximum connection measurement and that it happens in the very test phase. And the second situation happens in the real test phase, it is when that things have create a new connection, and of course, terminate a connection? The ideal for the plastic test, the throughput latency framework, etcetera. And we can achieve them in a way that do large enough and Empty connection cable for each test. So we the connection train table after his test. And we will number elimination of all plus about combinations in the payment phase. For this reason. Then you... The combination may occur."

So this methodology seems to work well and last autumn I was in Japan and do that with with testing and validating the methodology? So I tested it it's three different set eight six to for implementations. It was J and is a stateless. For... And that four six four, but combined with Ip tables together it it's given it state full eight six four, and also, it was open bs B f, which is a an another state and eighty six for implementation. And I found that the solution time works back. However, the approach was that we use only a single source and standardization just spare and we use multiple port numbers. And, of course, they have to limit the port number combinations otherwise, they will exhaust the the capacity of the connection table. It thought bad with linux. And even if we used multiple core computers, it worked better because we could set the this is scaling implementation So there's an as to command which you can set in the proper and interrupts are distributed among the Cpu cores and everything works. However, it turned out that that it open be a a davidson percent problem, because even open bs some with some cards work, but there's no no way two"

So it came the idea that we also need to use multiple Ip. And how to generate multiply version four. Of course, we have plenty of six, but we have some scarce number of version four. So when root after testing is done, the know twenty five forty four stars that first, which would use a single ip address spare, and then we should use two and fifty six different station networks. For this reason, we have some some the ranges. So let's say, on the left side of test we one hundred ninety eight dot eighteen dot zero eight zero. Twenty four. And on the right side, we can use behind end ninety eight dot nineteen dot zero zero for twenty four. And As we do not do without testing, we do not need multiple networks So we can use these bit of from, let's say sixteen to thirty twenty three to generate high number of Ip address. And it would be better because the nature the traffic would reflect. Better the the entire Traffic that would hit the set for Like. In know in... If if if if it is applied, to to forward about in that traffic. So this is our proposal that On the right side of the figure, you can see that we we can add ip for,"

So we kept the range from zero to twenty seven for the public Ip version four of the gateway and the other half of the range would be used as destination when we send it traffic from left to right, And on the left side, it's not a problem because can use any drive ip range, and this is enough to have a single ip at for just for the device on the test. So we've got the light range for for multiple source. And of course, the same works with Ip version six. So you can see that we can use the scene? This? Ip version for. Management for for the right side and the left side be a plenty of version six. So I think we can do it, but we haven't done it yet. So it is just an idea how we can use multiple Ip, Out tester has not yet implemented it. So we can perform tests only with the single Ip address yet and with Multiple port numbers, but it it has to be implemented, and I I plan to do so. But first, I would like to check with you if you find this method. Good and it should be implemented really. And of account.

Sometimes we received the question, are we speaking of the same draft just, you know, in two flavors just to address the benchmarking of the solid capabilities on the two data place.

We have in a head and node that steer the traffic according to a policy it with our policy, which is a sequence of segment identifier or Si We keep the state only at the the note and the the the state is not propagated.

Based on the policy, which is defined by the the the the Eden As I said, we built on this draft having in mind the benchmarking Rf, you see the list here and specifically, fifty six ninety five, which is the rf defining how to benchmark an Mp capable network device. As I said we have... We we have to consider two data place and this specific drive is about. Over mp. So next slide, please.

So basically, we remove top most label and we see which is the next operation to be applied to the packet and then continue which is the same operation as the traditional Mp labels swap. So basically, we associate label with a going interface and then the packet is forwarding according to the operation. So the reason for expanding what Rf fifty six ninety five d because we need to benchmark capabilities using see the list, which is longer than one. Need more than one segment identifies. Clearly, we have also two let's say, modify the reporting format. We need to based on the comments we have received on the list to enable at least one routing on dynamic routing protocol perform the test.

Continue focusing on the smaller loads. The row number five is the first interesting one? We have three"

Because this longer short trial if it is only one second. Not ten second. So One second is nothing reliable. But if there was bucket loss. Already in the first one second. It means that if we did not stop the traffic after one second. And continue for the ten seconds. That will be at least one bucket loss also in that case. Cannot all buckets in this way. This means that this One second. Passcode that second. And So that we remaining number of seconds. It's only some seventy nine reduce less than seventy. So we do not need to. Do another second. Measurements. Even one second measurement. We can already classify this as an upper bound. And when you compare lines four and five, You see we have a saved nine seconds. Just because we have reused short. Trial results that happens to be there. This is the new feature. Well one of the new features. Okay. What about good and short results. Row number six. But best example, we have sixty. Seconds coming from a good log and that the coming from and one second. Short measurements. But in this case, we still cannot decide. Because"

For example, we may be using some D that has large buffers and then one second this not enough the fill the buffers. There is a reason why user specified ten seconds there. Main evaluation. And one second this simply short it is not reliable. So even if it looks like seventy seconds of good results. It is not really seventy seconds of rely because the results. This only sixty seconds of good results so it is still unknown similarly to the road two. This shows the difference the three between a good shot and that short. Results. Virtual results. Because we can't. Because you cannot down those packets, but good for results frequently do dot com because when pull prolonged measurement, you can still have later lost buckets. And those The most complicated examples are seven and eight. Line seven. We have situation that looks almost bad. There are thirty seconds of bad trial results coming from a long. Twelve long trials. But, we have seven and three coming from short trials. In this case, intuition. Says that seven to three hold on. Short files is what we expect to happen in Well,"

There were only but short results we were them as losses is not here. We have three measurements we want second conversion is with some about seven without summers. We can say those three that measurements will you know, could people happen, so we cannot count to them. Was the one hundred second limit. In this case, we say that for the good and but short trials cancel each other and to do give us a any new information so. Only reliable information we have left these. Only thirty seconds of. But long trials And in this case, it is is assigned as a number fee. We cannot classify this mode yet. And you know, row number eight? We have edit one additional short death trial result. And Yes this is a skew the bit shorter against a good in this case, the algorithm count it basically the same as the rule number five. There is some excess of but for the results and we cover that excess. Towards the total of about twenty seconds and in this case. Algorithm decided. Multi question. Is an up about. So this is quite complicated, but if nobody sees any errors, so this is where the additional time savings will come from."

Sure that trials can Save your time but only in the case where they are not good. Short. Trials to cancel the bet traps. Okay. I think that's That's a good summary. There's complicated logic here. And you're having to deal with lot of different conditions. And classifying that the results of each set of trials. I'm very. Individual So And I think that's like got summary of very go are. And where you're going with the text Any, any questions about this material? Running up to the end of our session now. I can't you'll have more than ten minutes. So Thanks for. Thanks for this. So this update at summary franco. Appreciate it. Looking over to the next exploration of text, we can read. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Alright. Well, Thanks everybody for from participating. I'm really looking for or participation in terms of leadership and review. Next time. You know, I'll I'll do I can on the list. To try to shake that out."
