Difference I was mentioning earlier is that the user plane slice is a service that's offered to the user. While the control plane slices are something that is internally in the network. It's not a service that's offered to the user. So the operator can set up the control point slices not as a service user, but it it can be done and can be identified with, using the source port. And and the last comment was about that we had to address was it's the private network covered. And, others think that there's no difference in terms of the usage here. With, setting up slices for with the UDP source port. And so, yeah, it is covered. No specific issues to address that. So some of these actions do need updates. I mean, basically removing the PPR and some of the updates about control plane and, the private network. And in the subsequent pages, we have I'll show you what has been done. Because of the mix Okay. Here's an very high level overview, and you can see that the majority of the changes in terms of the chapter headings are that under chapter 4, It's now a lot of the things about applicability and the support network technology have been completely removed. There's only a small summary in terms of how this work links to transport technology. And then later on, it's just referenced. So that was the that is the work about PPR.

So I think the sig I mean, there is something, you know, it's a chapter and it's a para and the introduction chapter. But the significant text is that during the session phase setup, The control plane may use other 5 g provider slices for messages. To carry session signaling or to carry signaling data between 5 g network functions. That's the control plane. And the techniques do apply. That's the main point. But it's also clarified that these are requirements that the operator handles it's not to the user. I mentioned earlier, The last sentence is addressing the part of the public or pry non public. So private is referred actually as non public. So is the slice mapping using UDP source port may be used in IP transport tech networks for public or non public. Thanks. That makes great So I guess here, it's referring to the removal of thing. I don't know how well this represents a removal, but essentially everything that is linked to the PPR transport technology has been removed. What is left is how the transport network underlay may use the source port. There are two considerations that have been left behind One is, the range of source ports that can be used. And how security applies to when when you use the source ports. So so they're a little further down in the text there. But those are the only two aspects that are left, and they're relevant to how the source ports are going to be used 4. Setting up the space."

There is no specific use case say because as I said, the contract is really between the user and the 3gppnetwork. So That's where the slices are defined you know, because that's what the service should guarantee. And now there was a question last time as to whether this could be used for con slicing between control plane entities. And to that point, the answer is that, yeah, you can do it, but and that's why I've specifically clarified in there, that it is not a service that is defined by 3gpp. But this technique can be used to carry a slice that has certain characteristics between two entities that are separated. You know, perhaps deployed in 2 data centers. So an AMF one data center and a SMS and another data center. in May require certain characteristics. You know, I I'm not very sure about how useful this is going to be. Because this is going to this is more of a user plane thing.

And just one thing more, So when we talk about gnodeb or access network, we have a protocol stack for the And then when we talk about UPS, we have protocol stack there as well. So what would be the impact of integrating these on the protocol stack? Okay. Yeah. It's a a good a question here. If you try to think about the the we're not going will impact the, toward the air interface side. We are only about the integration part will be on the the entry. Well, if we call the, the the 5 gs things from the genome b to UPS things. The protocol stack already now is that the GTP tunnel things.

For the wireline is, is focusing on the IP, related edge allocation provisioning traffic steering redirect redirection and optimization etcetera.

And, also, it's going to have some a very specific category of like the radio, like a mobile, mobile, like, MMC and, like, a session management those type of things is also belong to the MCN, we are talking here. So based this, on based on the analysis of this queue, the mobile IP and the scenarios, So we summarize the Current protocols, for the MCN into, 2 the next 2 types of 2 types of, protocols.

So we are making recommendation that broaden that out allow Wi Fi devices to connect to that emergency, you know, make a emergency call.

I'm making a user native dialer, but where is this call terminated? I mean, again, this, like, you know, essentially Today's every operator have their own They my call goes to that I am a smart work if I make an emergency call. Here again, the the rule making is FCC, you know, what it's concerning is, like, you know, Can they find the stand alone you know, a manager voice provider. For supporting this service. Or use the AT and T's and Verizon's or or you know, any other operator in the world. Right? To support, you know, based on the regulatory domain, be able to, like, allow extend the IMS network to be use buy Wi Fi devices. So another important aspect is if you look at the signaling the access network location. See, I think location is central to all of this emergency calling. If there's no way to really provide a mechanics for, like, you know, detecting calls, location spoofing, or other things. The the ecosystem will collapse. So The framework that we have is, like, essentially, we want to be able to by bringing in open roaming kind of construct. The access network and identity provide In this case, let's say FCC designator identity provider, The access network will signal the access location. Let's say I'm in the IDF network. The access point here says that, you know, this device, using the pass point profile connected to the network, the location I can I can with certainty provide that this is in this you know, area? This specific location? These are the civic audio location. And can be signal to the to the IDP. Subsequently, when I make a voice call, in the SIP headers, the SIP PNE headers, I'll insert the I'll include the location, which is already supported. No. The location that the endpoint is signaling can be correlated with what the access network is saying."

So, yeah, that's the rope color and other aspects. Next slide, please. If you look at the the oral system here know, there's a access network. And know, there is a I identity provider. There's a CLF function which is a location client location function. Which is Now I make a call as a user that endpoint using the OCO emergency OCO a discourse access network Get access, Right? As part of that, the access network signals the location, So this location can be can be a civic location geospatial coordinates or it can be a device specific location, meaning If they're today in Wi Fi Networks, We do support indoor localization. It's a one meter level accuracy. Are able to identify the location of the user. No. I can essentially, you know, a constructed location tag, like, hashtagxyz and the real indoor location, and I can the access network can signal these 2 elements to the to the identity provider. Now I essentially, you know, if the is the location tag is provided at the endpoint. This is where we need a little extension, the SIP, and here that the SLC will be in included in the P and E header, but when the voice call goes to the PSCC, PCSCF It will using the SRT tag, it will do a location tip. And then what comes out of the location dip is precise location of that particular user. So this is a so there's another aspect to that. But overall, if you look at This is a system.

Also, it's not So clear how much the solution you have in mind with this architect that it draw depends on the 3gpppppp second, or or a cellular back end. Right? So I didn't see the typical cellular core functions, but it obviously depends on a triple 8 back end. Depends on Maybe a shared or common kind of, zip the assistance for the telephony. Right? Yeah. I think that's a good question. Actually, in the FCC history calls that this question came to please go back to the architecture diagram or the really showed up CS. Here, I think Yeah. I purposely Marco, you know, Nick's you know, the the picture that Yeah. This Right? one. Explicitly used the PCSCF, but if you look at PCSCF, nothing but a SPAU 61 SIProx. Right?

I thought it's easier to just leverage what is already deployed. Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the clarifications. In general, useful Thanks. Thanks, 10 g, CMCC. So for the, non 3 gpp access here, like using the Wi Fi park, I know there is a lot of disclosure. First question, they're the, one very critical requirement is, for the the authorization And then I think the 3 GBP has put a lot of effort on there. In order to authorize authenticate a user, through the worked worked worked But, here is like a So since your arguments are simply emergent, So it doesn't matter. Just to get this through. No need to go for, like, authentication authorization to see right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Not really. Today, I can make an emergency call that expires and A SIM that is removed from the handset the operators do support that. So It's not required that. I think But in fact, I think the question of authentication comes up because, you know, you know, do can we expose identity. I think, say, first thing you need to understand is there's no specific credentials. Because we want this to be widely when on the shelf device, When it comes from apples and in manufacturing or whatever, right, we should be able to use it. Right?

The second part is, like, for the non 3 gb access, here, and then you try to make a call, all those type of things. And there's also an effort to put on, like, IP stack between the, your gateway, like a Wi Fi gateway to the other side. So are you also considering that part? I tried to to see where are you going to put those, like, icons in order to protect your privacy. I think, the region will be has solutions for the if the if the device is solar Right? If it can reach the operator's network, their existing solutions, what whatever they are, even though nobody's in the world deployed a emergency PDG But At least, you know, whatever 3 g p p has done, So, wait.

I'm in a I'm in basement. a basement. Can't see a That's it. That's Okay. Now that's why you yeah. I think, I tried to, ask the question, and, like, for non 3 GPU says. In your case, it's a non service. Like, you have, the Wi Fi gateway and they asked you, guess, some, like, IPSAC tunnels, something like that in order to protect your privacy. And then the IP sector panel has to be from your Wi Fi access gateway to the other side. So what is your other side? Yeah. Yeah. I think the radius, I think, 2 things.

I think I don't know if that's your question, but, yeah, No. No. No. This seems like, so from your it's going when you do the call and they're going to offer its own phone number to the system. On the way back from, like, the other side, it has 2 rods. To your phone number. Right? Some place, somewhere. Through the, you know As part of the SIP registration, Like, what happens?

I have a question here when you are you are a assuming that there is already a Wi Fi connection happening between base station, the access point on the mobile, do you want to extend to have a sort of, emergency connection to SSIDs or something like this. If you are in a basement and you don't have a pre established Fi connection to the access point. No. No. If I'm in a basement, if I don't have, I think there are two cases.

In either of the cases, right, I think the assumption is without any having any access credentials. The Wi Fi network can the device attach? To the network. Get access so that you can make a call. That's the scenario. Okay. And, question question in the communication with the AA building block. You are mentioning your address. Last time I looked at IIM specification, you were using people who are using diameter Is it, is diameter intending and reduce is a fallback or for or reduce his main protocol to be used here. Yeah. I think that's a good question. If you look at most of the enterprises, Diameter is not deployed, right, in Wi Fi Networks to get the speed radius. So that's why it's good to keep it to limit it to our radius. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'm well. Hello? Darren Duke's. What what happens with bad actors who want to make sure that you don't get to call 911 or think that you're somewhere else that you're not really if they can mess around with the Wi Fi endpoints and move them where they're, like, Yeah. I think, so, Darren, that's a good question. Right? So let's say an endpoint, a spoof endpoint, It tries to signal some location. Let's say I'm here in Australia, and it's maybe at this point, you know, maybe the call goes as somewhere from Adelaide or something. Right? Right? The device is claiming that the location is, some Starbucks in Adelaide. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

Where it's supporting this emergency access. Also signals my location. To the CLF. There is a location entry that that's in the CLF Now the MS network makes a query. You know, am I seeing this device? Right? This whatever. Right? Do you is this a current location? So that way we can immediately the IMS network can know that. Okay. This location is not what the endpoint is reporting. Endpoint is reporting that location is not matching what the access network is saying. So that way, can they can detect any row calls. Oh, okay. But it it would be the access network that is the thing that is because it is, manipulated. Right? Not the endpoint. And the endpoint may not even know where it is if it's in a basement, it has no GPS. It it knows it's in a basement. Okay. So your question is that the access network is put. I think see, think I here, if you look at the open roaming kind of thing, there is a legal agreement between the access network providers identity providers. So they're operating under some framework. I think that that's another thing. Actually, the most important aspect is the immunity that I talked about We're extending the same legal framework So it's a it's not some rogue network. It's not any other any network. It's a it's a responsible network with some agreement with the identity provider. So that the network then assumes some amount of legal responsibility for providing this service. Looks like a carrier network would be doing, but it's but it's doing it for free maybe. So okay. Okay. That's it's interesting and it'll be interesting to see What the feedback is from people who might wanna deploy this. And if it would be in, like, home routers and, you know, unmanaged devices and that sort of thing. Thanks. It's real interesting. Sir. Yeah. K. One question. Marco."
