    "text": "so it was interested should read that draft and large scale is defined by Stewart not the internet yeah I mean yeah I mean we\u0027re talking about large not infinite and I think you are regarding the exact infinite right in that doesn\u0027t means larger scale than DSM which is the charter of the debt no that\u0027s right so yes we\u0027re talking about mobile phones or airily might work anyway mobile phone areas not factories and enterprises we\u0027re not we\u0027re not talking about anyone can connect anywhere and yet this service okay so candidate some candidate technologies so to the underlay there\u0027s a bunch of technologies that we can use flexibly thinit TSA I Triple E TSN sometimes networking we can build an enhanced queueing in quas model and we can have provide dedicated nodal resources as cpu slices and a network processor slices in the network layer there\u0027s a number of candidate technologies that we need to glue together regular mpls and our SCP te mpls sr looks quite interesting because sr provides a way of identifying resources without finding everything to the to the path assume there\u0027s our v6 is getting some attraction and then all the work we\u0027re doing in deterministic networking but our view is that that will the second reaching world needs enhancement to be usable because segment routing isn\u0027t really yet talking about resource reservation in the control plane this is Lewis contributor by the way as you move forward in your work yes I\u0027m separately try to clean up the separation of control plane and data plane because some of the things you were listening there were control plane and other things were data plane and you know it\u0027s good to understand which issue you\u0027re trying to enjoy yeah maybe the document does motion rsvp-te is in a network layer its righto plane right um LSP sortie POS fees are certainly I think actually we want to mention the TSP here perfect yes yes yeah that\u0027s how you set it up and there is what resources get bound to it and then there\u0027s who I you know whether the resources bound on the path or to the particular packet so yes we do need to clean this up we do need to clarify this there\u0027s the sort of bookkeeping which I always think of as the reservation stage and there\u0027s the actual setting up of queues and that\u0027s the allocation right and I\u0027ve been sort "

    "text": "of really sort of thinking you know with my sort of lower layer hat or yes and we will clarify that so there is control plain work we certainly need to identify what resources are available and send them up to a centralized control controller there\u0027s a bunch of technologies many of which you would discuss here earlier today or to SM age H CTN pset BGP LS which are good for having the conversation between the lower layers and the centralized controller what we\u0027re worried about is whether a pure centralized model at these scaling levels is right and what and how much we need to move down in back into the into a distributed model just to keep the thing operating in a timely basis so with with thinking it\u0027s not thinking about scalability right so if you think about what we\u0027ve got here we\u0027ve distributed and centralized control on the left and the state in the network versus the states in the packet on the right rsvp-te the state is kind of in the network with just a label on the packet and and it uses a distributed control whereas MPLS TP just as an example of just simple MPLS with a completely centralized control plane the the state gain is fully in the networking you have on touch in that case all the nodes in the network to set your path are honestly so SR took an opposite approach which is how to move all of the state into the packet well don\u0027t quite do that actually because they have binding SIDS which kind of break that model and move it closer to the to the hybrid approach here so given the large number of obsessions that we need to maintain and given constraints on label stack size and the fact that sr has no resource management in it yet we suspect we\u0027re going to end up only end up in hybrid approach closer to the center of this spectrum of of resource and control oops so what other work is not really good is it what other work is going on so we\u0027ve got a draft in spring we\u0027re trying to get adopted spring which describes the segments routing aspects of this of this work we\u0027ve got another draft in LSR describing some of the enhancements that we think need to happen to the leaf state protocols to collect and manage the information and do some of the calculations there\u0027s a lot going on in debt net which we see as one of the main underpins for for this work both the architecture and in particular the the MPLS solution document we see as very applicable and "

Barrow engine peril and the documents found the right home in my opinion and it is going the right way and thank you for an architecture that gives us context for everything I think we need to move some of this more towards a framework of pointing to other things and identifying gaps in work and you\u0027ve sort of got that on the slide so I\u0027m happy to talk yes please do and always we\u0027re willing to work with anyone who\u0027s going to help us then MacDonald in two plus one on you know previous comment as well and I have some consideration about the underlying hardware capabilities then I have taken to the account and that will be some of my concerns in other houses so some of the issues like thank you take that it\u0027s to take it on this would you like to do it I\u0027m not gonna ask question to this is only one question how many people are interested in hearing this topic more in the future you know let\u0027s continue to talk about it that\u0027s a really good endorsement that\u0027s a great number so thank you and with that we\u0027re over time and done made it through our agenda thank you all for a very good meeting and we\u0027ll see you in Bangkok [Music] "
