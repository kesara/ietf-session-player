    "text": "so these are the message exchanges right the most simple one is the grasp em flood right that\u0027s an unsolicited announcement of objectives service instances message type is described right you\u0027re describing a service if you\u0027re doing a unicast is already the other flooding options M discovery you find an objective that\u0027s a describe request it defines that most of the the attributes in the describe requests are invalid the only thing of interest are the service may be service instance name that you\u0027re looking for and it\u0027s actually very interesting paradigm for service discovery because it does the discovery stops at the first instance is found right so you can\u0027t have all the policies in terms of priority wait in this discovery in grasp but in a large network it\u0027s a lot more efficient because you\u0027re not flooding something right if you\u0027re basically having a lot of distributed service instances and the policy is always don\u0027t bother the whole bloody network with the fact that you are there and offering a service which is really meant for your vicinity MDM discovery very efficiently supports that right so in that respect of course grasp and the schemes that we have is a lot better than simple let\u0027s say mdns based flooding alone that would be M discovery then of course the same type of things can be done equally through unicast negotiations when you\u0027re just talking about service and negotiation discovery announcement between instances that have already found themselves like oh I know it here is a big you know Gateway for all type of service to the knock and then enumerate enumerate equal requests they would basically not return the locators but would only as in DNS SD only in return the service instance name and then you do a second look up from a service instance name you\u0027re interested in into its parameters including locators right and the backward compatibility is simply by the fact that the way that the service element is defined means that if you don\u0027t have the service element but you\u0027re just having what is currently in the ACP Draft and what I would also like to see in the brewski Draft which is just you know it\u0027s a service served or brewski served on est no other parameters it simply means that is a describe the locator to use is from the grasp header and you\u0027re done with it right so that\u0027s the full backward compatibility as soon as you add the service element to the objective value you\u0027re basically supposed to look into all these you know elements priority weight and so on so that that\u0027s kind of the gist of the proposal next slide yeah so here\u0027s the encoding on how to put the service element in a way into thousands of different objectives in a way that it can be easily detected and if you don\u0027t care about the stuff you don\u0027t need to have to do it and we don\u0027t need to come up with new grass patter extensions for quote Ayana registered common objective value elements which this effectively is so basically what you\u0027re doing is the objective value needs to be met a map is what is easily "
