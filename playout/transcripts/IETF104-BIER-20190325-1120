    "text": "there is no difference here yes I think one of the interesting question which is why I mentioned spring and segment routing is the question whether you\u0027re allowed to change the bit string without calling the operation be a decapsulation in rien capsulation if it\u0027s the letter one then you need to change the source address to be one owned by B that\u0027s basically the discussion about 8200 that\u0027s happening right now two things here I mean like the ROC a to double zero a say is that a destination options header you know the option types that we are allowed to you know carry allows to change the content and it says that there are two flags in the options type change flag so you know the beer option the option type that we are proposing to carry beer options we say that we said that change flag to say a one so that you know it\u0027s there all does understand that it\u0027s allowed to change the content of the beer options where in the beer header is encoded I feel that\u0027s basically something for a you by six men how to interpret that again because what that doesn\u0027t say is whether or not the operation means that B becomes the source of the tech at them right and if P becomes the source of the packet then of course it has to own a source address on by B right but what what do we think here is that this also does it\u0027s not going to change I mean I would like to do that and I\u0027m saying you know if you come out of six men and get an overwhelming you know sense that yes this will be allowed then it\u0027s fine otherwise basically the cost of doing business will be higher because you need to update the sauce spread so far achieve a sorry scope so eighty two hundred actually allows for the source IP address to be retained as the packet transits through the network in fact we early this morning the IP p.m. we had the similar proposal in which the IOM data goes through the changes hop-by-hop the source IP address does not change but it\u0027s still worth checking for this point okay you said there you go you use a multicast address in ipv6 header how does it work on the land how does it work on LAN LAN okay I mean like l2 not thought about that but yes but we are thinking that you know it\u0027s just a way to know a couple of advantages here to use a multicast address in this type of network is that you can avoid changing the destination address each hops and again itself you know alone addressed give you an example it\u0027s just like.how OST of the so the multicast address to follow the packets something "

Agrella let\u0027s work on the problem statement right let\u0027s get that one going and then we can pick up pieces you could quick question we got to move on okay um on this slides that there\u0027s three beer you skinned multicast address that we talked about that it doesn\u0027t work online so you have to use única unicast and that so that difference is gone and the markers are multi-hop replication whether you are doing is not no different from tunneling and in fact you are making that you are doing the tunneling even on the hopper hopper it entire it appears well actually I think it\u0027s you know hop-by-hop end-to-end delivery and then there\u0027s a new packet so it would be lovely to have this presented at 6 min just to get feedback and then also you mentioned the draft that you want it here in 6 or something is this sufficiently similar is that [Music] all right let\u0027s let\u0027s keep it short so I\u0027m highly sympathetic to not modify the source destination right I mean that would speed up the forwarding excellent if the 16 man let it pass cool I think the option keeping in the option is of a vote I think that getting just the next next protocol header getting a specialized thing it just appears you know your friend in that will be far more practical but that\u0027s kind of how I see it so it\u0027s kind of similar we can merge whatever discuss it shades of things [Music] "
