    "text": "yeah and I think I was asking those questions as well because Chris went um uh just clarifying you know is OC is the intent of the draft to only be about querying telephone numbers versus revocation or you know do we need both mechanisms and I think we should be clear about that I mean to me this is an attempt to replace TN by value or TMI reference in 8226 was something that behaves in a way that is much more lightweight doesn't have all those State Management delting and everything else problems and doesn't have the Privacy revealing problems like that that that's that's the job and if it tells you anything about certificate livelihood that's just like gravy I have a separate comment uh but I didn't wanna if anybody else has comments on that one uh this is rough so I just want to make sure I understood that last comment if you get a no it doesn't mean it's revoked it means not this phone number not right now yes but if you get a yes it means yes the certificate's good and is good for this phone number right now yes okay it does not mean it's good for any other telephone number oh yes correctly at least the certificate is not expired or compromised yes um my other comment was just to sort of say what I said before probably prematurely but um uh another plea to maybe simplify things and just talk about stapling with ocsp as the only option um as the only option as the only option I mean so that would be an argument to recombine the drafts right I'm worried about I'm worried about fragmentation and people getting confused and all the good stuff that we talk about um I think this really is the end state that we should be at"
