So in just on distribution for streaming scenarios, but we haven't spent good amount of I'm thinking about. What is it about two two different two areas that markus chartered with one is real time top on the requirements that brings and another thing relay on how to we build realize that could work for unified use cases that Mark started with. Next slide. So what's happening out there? This is not first time, we have discussed this. There's a quite a few active threats and issues. Have we been this for a while, this is the time we need to kind of come together and see how can we make the mock transport for the use case that has been chartered with. Next slide. So I I started be giving a typical scenario where you want to use a real time scenario, which is slightly different from how streaming center network would work. In this case, you can see that our multiple, each having different tracks or different qualities. Identified by the thickness of the line and color of the line means different media types are different tracks, and they send all those things over. One quick connection, and the main role of the relay to look at those tracks and and look at the... What receivers need. And basically tries to answer those queries in a highly scalable way. And if no... It needs to be able to make this decision on fly. And the one of the different things about the or receivers is that in interactive scenarios, this of they come and go,"

Next slide. So just put putting more words on from there on the previous deck, So scenarios are mainly unified in just distribution system. That means what are the identifies where you use on the data model that we use needs to be visible through throughout the system depending upon how someone builds the system. And different multiple, they can dynamically will come and go. Their tracks can be added and removed. Say for example... Example, someone is doing audio video. They add the screen share the the screen share. And one of the important things of building a release that could support interactive scenarios is Should be able to take tracks from multiple... What we call as bundle in the today's draft split it up into individual tracks and merge them based on how the work we would like to have this flexibility where release you don't have to be tight, to a bundle restriction, they should be able to kind of create the prior decision they would like to and also use the quick connection resources efficiently as possible. And having that as the requirement would be nice thing to consider. Next slide. So as he's changing slide, let me remind you so so we have a good number of people here are not needed acres of English. So if you can slow your pace a little bit down, so it's easier for people to follow that would be Thank you. Okay. This scenario two is we are showing a use case where there are two different distribution systems, like you can think of in our different relay distribution systems.

So does it mean in terms of requirements? We need to have mock much media flows and across distribution networks. It should have some way to there should not there should be no ambiguity in didn't identify identifying the cracks. And also the protocol behavior should be uniform. We cannot have protocol behavior in one way within the system when it goes across the system to have different protocol behavior, have a uniform protocol behavior across hops and tracks must be independent and and hence provides an access to subscribe to an this two. And this should work regardless of having a Web transport or not, because there are many use cases where we would want to have the supported or where need click session.

And once you receive the catalog, and when you do subscribe and publish, it carry necessary authorization information so that you release can now act on us or should at least validate authorization so that they are willing to participate in in publishers and subscribers, and we need to think about how we want to do that. So requirements on the the best transport would be And permissions published or receive on the tracks. And how and expectation expectation is that the images would receive an out of band some token. That would describe what is authorized for the upper parameter or receiver and and that needs to be provided to the release. Realize all the policy enforcement points who would participate in who decide. Who can participate and for subscribing.

But if you have a large an odds, we have a problem with adaptation. If you have a large fan, you would have a source sending two hundreds of thousands of recipients in real time, and that source will probably not be able to adapt to every change in the receivers. I mean, traditional way in the receivers, is to ask for different documents say, hey, I was trying to get the high def track and I think my link is to slow. I will go for the low track now is that kind of stuff it doesn't scan very well in these large groups because it is a lot of traffic going to the source. It also creates delay in middle of connection. So we think it was most large fan out scenarios What we really want is some kind of layout and including in which the can peel off the layers excessive in real time. And this support for layer and.

We had a long meeting yesterday and I still don't feel like a lot of smart people in the room and still don't feel like we really had breakthrough or people really interested understood what was going on. Trying to clarify what this what this really means, even if you're not choosing between two different things that receivers want even if you're not choosing between receiver it that wants sharpness or smoothness even just basic delivery with no receiver choice whatsoever? There is a conflict if the only level of priority that you have is something like send order, which has been proposed before, The send order is naturally the decode order of the package as they as they come out of the encode. So the encode streaming out the packets, in the decode order the receiver needs to decode and then, that's the natural sender order that you need to prioritize things into. But the problem becomes if You're under congestion, that order is not really encoding the priority because of under congestion, I may want to drop some packets of a certain frame are lower priority than other packets, I want keep the base layer of that frame So keep some of the packets of a single frame And I don't wanna prioritize the next frame. And I don't wanna to prioritize everything in the order that was emitted by the encode. So under congestion, there's a need for changing the way that you prioritize things, not in the order that the encode emitted them And that's the key thing that is not captured by something like send order.

Please keep going and we'll we'll drain the queue at the again. Let's go to the next slide. So as I explained, I mean, the reason is the from two d to d is to have basically another in the group that says that a should be sent b before B if the priority of a is lower than the priority b if thou, but the object number of a is lower than the applicable number b. And after a group when way we can we the priority, and that's a different issue but we can discuss that later. Even to do this basic thing, we have two my that seem considered that could make those things is one mapping to have one stream per group and priority level. And if you do that, you get something very nice is that all the congestion can be handled down the stack. It is This the quick stack will naturally send the streams in other priorities if you have several trucks in parallel it will do one well been within a priority order which is a very nice way to manage the bandwidth between the tracks. And basically, the right will happen. The mapping is to have one stream object but at that point, we run into the issue that is expressed in the center order. B dependency within the layer"

That means that the default assumption that you should always send the last stream with the ras packet first the restroom first. Is wrong. Mean, that that's an assumption we see for example in the w three c Api for web transport. That will do the exact opposite of what we want. Now Of course, an Api is an Api, so we can always play gamma with the Api end of the day with sixty four bit numbers we can and cut the arrival with the reverse order or three zero, but you have to do tweaks. In the center not to do that. If you do priorities, It's kind of simpler say well I have very keys and when that within a given priority I do people. And that works. That works within a single track that works less well in multiple tracks because the fee four is defined by some fuzzy like, the other in which to stream has been created and there is no guarantee that multiple stream. Will be called overhaul I think that we could make easier of those work it will only require secondary walk, the group boundaries is in the order of object in a given layer.

Notably K c which is apparently, you know, you'll either maybe one back and Google so Google actually uses by default if you'd try to do multi layer vp nine and Chrome webrtc.

So basically, all we need to send up frames of the layer you're actually interested in. And you can just completely omit the other ones. So I don't think your model the the priority can handle that.

When you say pipeline us means like, we... You don't release not have to wait for the full object to come because sometimes if an object is a go, you don't know how many bytes or object are. In the frame, you might know, but objects between the release, they they are just pipeline through the release. And we we need to think about their cases where some applications especially most of the interactive real time kind of application they would encrypt the object with some like, a decipher. In that case, it it becomes important that in objects have or delivered if possible with with the authentication tag oh yeah. In in them.

So the the most basic of Mock transport is tracks. They're not tied to connection. They are not data model, they're not connection or or a specific transport usage, but there are trucks as a data model. What attract is a transform of un media. A specific encoding an encryption process. You... The bag of bytes to get off that is a track. Track has a name and and it's it... It it is an authorization scope So if someone wants to get a track, from text audio. I need to have it have a scope authorization to receive audio video. And if truck has owner. Tracks don't lay by themselves. Track has honored, a like an, someone's to phone, someone's camera. And it's under a single provider mean. When I say provide domain, is the It's then it's an application provider who's responsible for the application. And it has a single encoding and configuration. And to support the use cases of multi cdn distribution systems, we need to have track to have sufficient information that will identify it across the distribution systems. And publish and subscribe? Explained happens on tracks. And we do not need understand bundle, one is useful concept. They might we do not need to enforce as a requirement at every direction and. Bundle a way of putting things things together as a product decision domain. That makes sense. In some context, but it does not make sense in some of the mis release that we thinking about, and we don't need to understand bundling those concepts. That's that's of the differences. Next slide, please. And some of these concepts out there in the current back"

That are the ones that set up the cracks. This is authorization that goes along with that, and it also manages life cycle of cracks. Because once you subscribe an audio track or video track, you might get those media packets depending about how someone maps each audio frame to one... Or which each video frame to one stream versus multiple multiple frames to single stream, you might get more a lot of streams coming to you. And this... There's need a way to say if someone stops that's exception or someone stops publish how directly. Control stream and control messages out basically manage life cycle of the tracks. And their are data streams, these are the uni streams on which you actually send. And Mock transport supports both quick streams big data for carrying media so that we can support all the use cases that we're thinking and this thought of catalog. Catalog is also treated as a special track. Which you can go to a power decision with some. You can get the catalog as a black. Next slide. So I'll handle the question again. Okay. I'm back. Yes. I mean then showed the in the Now your discussion, the idea of having the screens to be sent it by set of groups the set of objects of different priorities we have to a way to those disparities the way we have done that in a prototype is to pass to concept the point itself And some kind of treatment saying the hey. If we are in a case of congestion, easy better to just keep queuing and wait until each of the transition results or the user, up."

We cannot at the of the being very small especially if we can make assumption that properties of the exact audio using the stream interest case we have to send them just once at the beginning. Next slide please One thing I was concerned in the transport is make sure that we don't make necessarily assumption about how the quick stack behaves because the reality of the market today is that different quick at different capabilities maybe we are gonna see convergence we are probably gonna see command and based on the priority schemes defined for Http three. I don't know that we are going to see much more than that. But I'd like to be able to basically three layers one is the basic player little a quick stack is basically not doing any kind of prioritization. Which decision is done at the application level that's a bit gross, but you can do it at the application level because I mean, If you don't send anything else, what you have sent will be seventy four minutes so you can always do that by deciding what you write in the quick stack."

And then I I read the specs of what's transport but by the w three c with the idea of avi sixty four bit send order etcetera? That's one way I maybe we should support that two I'm not convinced at all that this is the right way to do it, but we shall see that. So, yeah, basically, apple wait too back to the quick studies is what I want. Next. Next slide miss. Okay. Summary. Even the this draft is called Mock transport, we wanted to call watt zero five, but we didn't want confused the group so we came up the name as a placeholder order. But what we want to ask to consider based on the scenarios that we presented, I some new requirements could support the real time use cases and also setting up the and the scalability considerations for that. At same time, think about, you know, how do we think of tracks as independent components. The current proposal says it should be tried tied to a web session or or something like... Like that and and that would limit in see session saying that we cannot deal with tracks on the their own. And then we want to have this authorization scope to the cracks? Applications if they want to choose a bundle, totally possible, and we should support them. But not should be the only way to go about it. And second thing is that to make release, the bundling is one way to think of a prior prioritization domain, but"

So we need to have flexibility to separate support bundle. As is not bundled as a prior decision construct. We're out there. Get some numbers and see what works best with quicker, we have mock spotify if I could call, we have a prior edition scheme which we feel it works. For both use cases, bundle is another way, but we need to have flexibility and we don't... We're not at the point where we can make a choice on that one. Second thing is that the base transport should not define how prior prioritization or the send order or the new word, I'm calling here that the forwarding preference is set for object. But it just should explain how it can be used by the. Because each application might have a different ways to set it. And we need to let it be open to experiment before we make a choice on that one. Like, to today it says that, you know, everyone is a prioritization contact construct. Which we need to experiment a bit. And we need to have the flexibility there. And the best transport should not say how it should be. And we talked about objects not a not good repeat. And there should be it since that use cases for transfer on native quick, we should support both. And we had a few discussions amongst authors of the bottle drafts. And we think it's possible to do that. Basically steps six is a repeat of how how the forwarding preferences should work. And how should the release should have flexibility to fix flexibility to make choice on should should I bundle lot not bundle. Or how how do I take the streams from incoming and should I'm map to same connection out on all outgoing like, you know, have one or one mapping from the incoming going I want to say merge them or split them. That's the choice less have to make, and they have to have some... Somewhere time running with that to make a proper choice. And base transport should not or we don't have. Right?

I don't see anybody in the queue and I see luke walking slowly this way So thank you Sue much for that presentation. Hello. So wake up. I'm here. So I wanted to go over the four changes. Hindsight, we probably should this first because there's a lot of context from houses like, requests. So next slide. So high level overview. We have a concept of this. There's four layers right now in the object model, There's a concept of bundles Within a bundle, you have multiple tracks. With within on track, you have multiple objects, with an object, you have multiple sorry. Mobile groups and then you have multiple objects It's nested within. four levels, it's pretty simple. Bundles used to be called broadcast, but it was confusing. So we just made up a word bundle, like, bike said it as much as you want. It's a track bundle. And groups are similar to to go. That's why they call groups. Well we go over each of those specifically. Next slide. So what is a bundle? It's just a prioritization domain. It's effectively saying that There these tracks? Let's say it's a, you know, there's audio and video and they prioritize against each other That's a single bundle. If you have multiple tracks, you know, sure it's just a bigger bundle."

Theirs prior separately. So a bundle is just a prioritization domain and it requires a connection in order, the same connection in order to to do prioritize over real quick. But that's all it is. It says that these tracks are bound together. Next slide? What is the track? Hey. This is pretty simple. This an encoded. Using track terminology from and before. In this case, this is an example of a bundle with four different tracks. You could have audio video, captions, time metadata data, arbitrary metadata, well. Like get arbitrary data. Doesn't really matter. Next slide? And in the group, realized that the relay does need some dependency information. The previous draft had objects, which you can think of as frames is like one analogy of thinking about it. But the relay doesn't know how frames are related to each other it can really deliver them in dependency order to an extent. This is mostly a problem when somebody new joins the stream, And the real it serves the most recent frame, could be a frame. It's just not the code. So group is just a very basic dependency structure saying that within a group Objects can depend on each other. They cannot depend on other groups. And this is mostly for the relay for join points. Next slide. And an object. We're just calling this... I I call it a fragment, In fact, I like the name fragment better, but let's not like said that. The relay this is it opaque payload, it doesn't know what's inside. It could be a frame. It could be two frames. It could be three frames could be audio samples it could be a catalog. It could be an entire go. And the... This is the level at which prioritization occurs. So you have all these different fragments being sent over the network."

So What's the question? Sorry? What how... So I think you have the... You had a bundle and then you have the tracks. And you say tracks are coding. What is then media source. Because as Bum is... Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. A bundle is not necessarily scoped to a single source. And you could have multiple tracks from different producers, and put them over the same bundle. Okay. Basically, the tracks have to be aware of each other because they're prioritized. They can see each other. You don't wanna take some arbitrary track that says highest priority. Someone that says lowest priority. Put them together and then, you know, starve So they have to be aware of each other, but they don't need to be from the same source necessarily. Okay. So you're gonna have to build something additional on top of tracks potentially to understand how example, media source to try at different encoding, if your for example is intending to do Yeah. So the the relay doesn't need to know. Yeah. Sim cast or or something like that. Is the the assumption here. That the proposal is That media stuff is punt to a catalog. And the catalog describes the properties of the tracks. I probably should have had a slide on on catalog. So that the viewer knows the properties, which went the request You can I spell this codec?

Edition the main of that. And does the compatible and that can be bundled to get on a single connection. As of them say Oh, I request a bundle. Because, I mean, I think that's one of the difference real time communication scenarios that The concept of bundle is much more fuzzy it's not something as it's in advance because we'll look at various videos from values points in various sources in in a conference those will be constrained use compatible prioritization because the are part of the same, And authority, and they can be bundled together and different one can be bundled get different accounts in the network. That's not quite mean. We have to be clear there. So I wanna be clear. That's why you can have multiple sources in the bundle, it's perfectly valid to combine bundles if if the relay or the Mu is aware that they are doing the same scheme, So that is do not seem to be separate. They can be split. They could be merged. It's just saying, These tracks should be delivered over the same connection because they're aware of each other and they prioritize against each other. Yep.

We just wanna make it opaque we don't want the relay to even know this is media. It's metadata. They should never parse that it could be encrypted. So object it can be of any size. And any content. Next slide. So some more specific properties that was a very high level overview These are the type of things we're hash out and that called some of the disagreements. Let's cover them the next slide. So bundle. In the current draft, bundle is synonymous with the web transport session. As in it is effectively a single It's a single session. Has a url. In this case, that's how you identify sneak uniqueness. And it defines that prioritization domain. Like, within web transport, You have a send order that send order only applies to that session is the current idea. These are really the two properties it needs and need some way that I think I think of the slides actually had ability. I change the word from uniqueness but And yeah. So send order within a bundle, and then it's unspecified between bundles just like web transport. I would recommend around robin, but technically, you can do whatever you want. You could have a premium customer and say this bundle is more important than this bundle. Next slide? So track. Track is similarly. It's it's got some identifier. It's on a per bundle basis as in tracks are bound to a bundle they can't leave You know, they had they have they're a member of one. It's subscribed. And yeah, I think these are the old slides because they see my typo. And So you can subscribe to tracks. These are the most common switching points. You know, you're watching it for Adp and you wanna switch a seven twenty p or whatnot. So it's one of the things you messaged mention in the subscribe message. Any media properties for a track are defined in the catalog."

Can I I'd tell ask a clarifying question? About what you mean by uniqueness do you mean that the same you just explain more about what you mean by? I mean, meant. Is what the... I thought I renamed the slide two? As in track has an Id, and it's it's scoped to the bundle. Right now, it's a var could be a string. But it is tracks are scoped to the bundle. Okay. So Basically. Yep. you're saying there two tracks in a bundle cannot have the same Id as the property years. So that way you can subscribe to them. You give a bundle Id and a track Id. As your subscribed message. Okay. And maybe a group id will get there, but Next. Yeah. So group, same thing it's addressable on a per track basis. These are all nested, this hierarchy. So that there's a group Id idea. Increments. It's actually sequenced. That way the relay knows which one newer? So if it has to choose, like, somebody you join the stream, what do I serve them? Also so the one with the bigger number. And it's independent. So the relay can use this property to know that it just serves all the objects within a group for this new viewer, and it doesn't need to sort of part of the previous one. It knows that the dependencies are abound within a group. And this is what's currently listed as a discussed in the before draft. Think we've kind of come to a consensus on this. But we should talk about it if not. Next slide? And then object, there's more. So again, it's addressable per group They just have an Id. Again, this is all very."

Again, they prioritized based on the send order within the bundle. And this is one thing that we added in war before is incremental as in... It really relay must not buffer, or I should I must not buffer I think I again I changed the wording a little bit on the new slides, there really should stream objects. It shouldn't keep them because otherwise, every hop will add latency. If it sits there to aggregate everything before forwarding it, we might add some way of making it atomic, but I know if that's necessary. I'd much rather assume it's always incremental. And then the payload is opaque to relay. Eight should never look at it she never parse that You can think of these first four things being in the header, then a payload payload just follows afterwards. Next slide. Work? I just wanna make the comment here that I think that that most the authors of all these drafts are in total agreement with what like, we've... You know, that come together on that over the last few days. We're all saying the same thing about the streaming, that the autonomy, you know, atomic, and those are the same things we saw on the previous slide.

We could do pooling I think it's pain in agony? And I would much rather find a better way of doing pooling or delegate to web transport. But it's something as a working group we should discuss. Also if we even need a real quick implementation of web transport is sufficient Okay. So we're gonna take a brief password because we didn't know you I didn't realize you had updated them. So I'm gonna stop sharing and try the new one. And we'll see if we can get back to where We'll see where this does turn out to be the new one. It's it's my differences. It's mostly in the section. Seems like it would be important to get that. Ian sweat. Well you have a moment. Yeah. You shouldn't do pulling. Of prop. It's it's not gonna make a little better. So when you're doing web transport since web transport a lot you have multiple sessions and all that stuff, then that gives you pulling if you want it. In terms of whether you not you really need quick as well as what transport, I'm I'm inclined to think this model, we should design it. So we can have both, but I do wonder if it's gonna turn out that no one will ever that. So And to be clear, in production, I actually ship both. Because our android team did not wanna do web transport. So we use quick transport for them. So it is is possible. So how's Cisco? Pulling his has here because we wanted to map multiple web transports onto big connection. We don't have to bring that for it quick.

So we should talk more about why specifically so I I think that we should not spend too much time in this meeting right now talking about web transport versus real quick.

Next thing that Wi gonna work on is we're going to take catalog message and but really doesn't need to know about it. So why does it have a message about it. We're gonna send it over a track. So you're gonna have effectively a catalog track gonna have a different encoding. We're gonna have a set separate draft. Effectively, you're gonna have a transport draft of the relay implements, and it just works for opaque payloads. And then a media specific draft that the encode and decoder is aware of that includes like what the tracks are and how they're related They have a registry for the different catalog formats. And I think I think the plan at least, we we'd like to explore doing our own one, but also existing standards. You know, throw H in there if you really want. It should work in theory. Next slide?

That's a great summary of months of discussion here, sir it's really nice to see everything coming together and also So work. It's it the convergence is real even if many people may appreciated it. Mike I should have written down my christian. Dispensing accolades It... Oh, the question is about... We're we're very quick to say pulling complex And so my immediate solution is I can do web transport over a quick session per my bundle. Now that works as long as I have hundred or two hundred bundles. I'm I'm spawning quick sessions, which are expensive. If I'm a relay a third party relay provider and I'm covering several hundred thousand stations each of which once a web transport and which can only do prioritization within a dedicated quick connection. I at have to maintain hundreds of thousands as of quick connections between every relay pair. That I think is prohibitive expensive. So we we need to work towards...

What about this? And this and this So I think it it is harder than it looks. Victor. Yeah. So I was wanted to talk about kind of other function of bundles that we kind of tried to the couple, but maybe not really It's it bundles are, like, associated one to one with like, to transport endpoint, which could be like Ice transfer to alarm. Like, you're all quick at for. Heads like I'm trying to say if we even if attempted to get rid of bundles, and like, decides to track. It's like our all or like, highest level transport unit and we do skip the tracks. We would still have to deal with the facts of, like, In order to get multiple tracks, you probably get to connect to, like some endpoints. So you still have some notion of the highest level, like, the first if you like... If you imagine the name as a top of the first. And trades a top will always be like a transport head. To what you're connecting. Because otherwise, that's really work. So we might one to d there, but we also need to think about, like, even if we don't use them as per prioritization domain and prioritized and tracks. What what does it where does that url go? And what does it mean? Like I don't want to reiterate with my slides, but the I I I here is that bundle is is because it's pound bound to web transport.

I get end streams. I want to send out streams and the objects belong that one. I want to make a decision. And at that point time, should I go and round robin the bundle? It might be one prioritization scheme or I might like, what we have implemented in in quicker... Krishna was talking about each object carries the priority. A strict priority and that that works too. And at this point in time tying, a prior prioritization domain to transport usage is too early, and we need to before making decisions on that. Kristen? Yeah. I mean, it's pretty much what was saying. Is it So we have to get that as truck as a property which is the proposition domain of the playstation algorithms advanced use. And that decision algorithm. Lines well so I can be model with something else or not But just not quite the same thing at saying the connection is bundle. I I think that we are missing things there. And I think that in particular, having the name of the truck tip depend on the network bundle it's not something that I'm ready struggle because you can just as well to said that level capture on the all the other source. Because you want to"

And I think thank you to all of the authors who worked so hard. I do think it's been a little bit of a challenge today. There's been a lot of work in the hallways at the This time. That's always used and there's been a lot of convergence as I think people have said, But I think it's a little bit hard for the working group to necessarily follow because some of the context was in those So please do use the mailing list. If there are issues that you think were raised today and you don't understand how a particular proposal came forward. Please do ask on the mailing list. There's probably at least three other people are holding back asking the same question. And we'd like to make sure everybody comes along with the context as well as we can. In the meantime, the next person up is T, who's gonna talk about a particular set of metadata. We we were actually originally planning to do this tomorrow, but because he's flight schedule interfere with it, we're gonna do it today. Thank you for to a little be get your spots? Thanks. It's really high microphone. It's like good. That's okay. Don't see it either. We have your slides? Heat rate. So third I can get Yeah. Yeah. And may I have a ten minutes condo. Thank you.

Now like to I like to share idea about kind of that aware a ting extension for the middle or quick release. And now I sent the Y three and a for their support of our draft next slide, please. And now the first of all I not should make a consensus about what kind of basic agreement of ours apart the middle of a quick relay. And we list lit up them on the slide. First of all, it should get access to the header of an object. But not the equipment encrypted content of it It should forward package, which is Obvious. It can schedule reorder the third order of some peg it received and may drop some of the package under some certain and circumstances and maybe should implement other features. Or something else. But the basic agreement is that we should have some relays which can scare you and it can control the package next slide."

    "text": "So there are a lot of traffic that you made our create a working group that it talks about the priorities. So about the order, the priorities I that like... Yes, we have the priority, so we can make it better. To better scheduling. So we are considering whether this is now the middle real quick especially for the real time transport. So we think that there are at least two dimensions to schedule or there different kinds of priority priorities. The first one is about the time that maybe late her package is more important than the older package and the importance which means that key frames is more important than the pretty frames something like that. But there we have two different dimensions about the priority and we have to encode into a single priority priority field which seems not a good idea. And about the global priority is also a difficult task to discuss in the middle list is whether we should add a globe priority priority to show which is more important than others. And what is what is exactly important is that the relay on actually no when to give up a kind of overdue the op objects, which is put forward on the middle. And some kind of opinions occurs thin So we think that we need some kind of indicators of the timeless Next time, please. About the timeless, which means, I mean that we need to indicate the applications requirement and it tensions about where should the data should be used? And the renter data should be overdue and some kind of Some kind of opinions are called, like we call that deadline or the time to live or the max delayed"

Slide, please? Yes. And our draft things that we can add had a kind of timelines is parameter called the deadline into the X header. And here is a simple example you edit in the middle real quick transport draft you can see that we can add optional parameters field at a lot of the header and we can add some of different meanings of the flags so that we can indicate the relays about how we can use these objects. Next time, please? And for Del deadline aware made transport, made our relay opponents, we have three different components. The first of all is the data unit we block but actually, it is objects in the middle or quick station. And the metadata be just the mentioned that is called the Data deadline is a kind of timely parameter and we have some different actions for the release and Now we... And next we'd like to talk about some specific movement the actions of how the release. Next day. First of all, it's about the ingestion. Think that the public can myth the object with a time on it and we call that with the your next timestamp step on the in the header that be can informed the release about the latest time it should transport the kind of data.

This is this time meaning the expected latency for their application. And be added to the header of the object so we can inform the relay about it. Next slide, please. Then we get the timestamp, the second one is about scheduling sky is still discussing about what kind of algorithm, we should have how we can get different blocks using the priority or the data deadline, and we think that we can use the some parameters like that deadline to show that, which block is more of which object is more and others so that we can show we can make better decisions for the release to transport the object to the next half. Next, please. And for the top, the drop is still important discussion. So we think that with the data deadline of where parameter which is data and I, and we can give up the certain blocks with that is overdue, so we can just to give them up or marks them as Yeah Active, so we can release the space of the relay barber. And someone similar behaviors on the release, can also use such scheme to understands the applications intention and have a better command of what data it's should transport next exactly.

So that we can avoid some package lawsuits and we can recover the data from the package. And next slide, please. The second option no is about a drop notification and the separate subscribers request the drop notification can notice the client when the block or the Object is dropped and the client can also send the request to the release it can claim that we can a tolerant longer delay so that we can override the data deadline parameter And that is still under discussion, and I'd like to hear your voice and the next step, please? And the potential benefits of the Data where actions is Yeah. As is on the slides, but we still need more measurement and confirmation, but the basic proposal it is that it the latency and sale of bandwidth and Chris a real time performance of mid. Next step. And the conclusion is that in the middle of a quick working group, I think it is necessary to add such parameters to show that and we should edit to the header, and we does propose kind of data deadline where actions all the middle of real quick relays, which can to some to some extent to through the real time performance stop it, and we made do have field words about to do more measurement about this idea to and some product prototypes to prove our concepts and to and and then our draft if our"

And we we will point out we're already a little bit over time Thank you troy love for this, and church would like to just remind folks that we wanted people to be aware of the work, but we're not anticipating that this would be taken up by this working group at this time. So it does not work. Proposed for adoption at this moment. It's just information a working group about a particular approach. That this research group has investigated and ...for those of you who who don't have incredibly great eyesight. There's a low contrast github link on the bottom of the slides you can little bit more details Colin. Thank you. I I think this idea is is really good and needs be in draft. And we've sort of called it time to live at various times of variant of it, and I I think that we should put that in or right away and have it going forward. So thank you for that. I do think though that on the notifications about the drops, that that creates this just that can create a really imp of event back, and I'm probably not in biggest favor of that. I obviously, the relays would collect as part of their metrics and operational data all the drop information and can get information that level but that sort of instantaneous real time feedback. I think we'd have to think very carefully about to do that in such a way that we didn't get an explosion of drop patients back or the client that generate congestion. But I Like that idea. Thank you. Yes, drop a notification is especially is especially designed for the situation when maybe there are different client which need different kind of So we support that this may help, but Yes. You can either front polish. How's Cisco. I had a clarification question for the redundancy and encoding, do you expect to have access to the media?"

Hey if if it's required access to the media payload. Maybe we we can separate two different layers and say, there can be some kind of a deadline. That normal release can work on and some kind of special replacement on we get transformers that we're talking about. That would do more special things on top. Yes. Hi. I just wanted to say, thank for presenting this work. It's interesting. I think it's the kind of thing generally that would be good and might need a solution. I think we discuss clocks in quick. Will probably attest to, like, difficulty time synchronization in things like dash, especially low latency and tolerance is that like I think that's something is that we really hard to solve, but that could totally be done so of the good work. Yes. Send for a comment. Thank you, Again T. And thank you all. Reminder that we have another session tomorrow in the last session of One one six. We look forward to seeing you there.
