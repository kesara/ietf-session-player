    "text": "the client it\u0027s unclear if the server really wants to be able to support this they may be a little bit more complex but if we have use cases that could certainly be added another interesting point is that because at least the way it\u0027s currently defined in the draft it only is happening during the handshake it doesn\u0027t take into account protocols like MP TCP in which you are going to be rebinding to different addresses that would lead to saying maybe we should have something that we can do later on in the connection which is exactly what we are proposing that we can do for quick pretty simple we just say hey what\u0027s my public address and then you get a response back so the limitations here are that still you can\u0027t detect stateful firewalls that don\u0027t translate your addresses but you can handle multipath migration of your bindings and this is can actually be a really useful way of adding ways to help connection migration realize when migration has happened because of a net reminding versus an explicit decision to switch different networks and so that\u0027s essentially it we\u0027d love to hear any feedback or thoughts of if this is useful I know there was some similar ideas of using this as h-2b to thing rather than TLS and if people think that\u0027s a better way to pursue this let us know I Wes vertical USC I say a couple of questions really quick is this NAT v4 specific you didn\u0027t really state whether you were considering v6 or not so yeah great hopefully people aren\u0027t doing NAT six-six all that much but it definitely applies everywhere I think the the wire formats do any address family encoding because you could have a nat64 you could have a NAT six six and so you do want to detect that either way okay the bigger question is why is this a TLS specific problem if if clients around the internet need to know their public\u0027s address which i think might actually be somewhat needed by games and lots of stuff why are we doing this in each protocols as opposed to doing some more generic solution that operates at a different level so I think in the case of quick it\u0027s a little clearer because I believe to some degree this is kind of a transport handshake question that\u0027s nice because we already have an encrypted transport there because it\u0027s all kind of baked in putting this in like TCP would not be something that we could easily extend and also we want to make sure the information is encrypted the other direction you go is that you put it inside protocols that run on top of TLS and you just redefine it for each of those use cases so I agree that it\u0027s not totally clean I think the quick story is "

    "text": "much cleaner hi Daniel Congo moire ACLU so thanks for bringing this work here I do you think this is you this looks useful I\u0027m a little bit curious about when you I appreciate that you\u0027re aware of the problem with a server lying and that you said you obviously wouldn\u0027t make any sort of security decisions on this basis and yet I so you see this address change only 40 less only during the handshake right so it seems like there\u0027s some sort of cross TLS session thing potentially that would be going on where you might live you might observe a rebinding with one TLS session that your address has changed that might be different from another it sorry what would you do with this information as a client but isn\u0027t security sensitive so in the case so TLS unless it\u0027s over something like MP TCP wouldn\u0027t really be detecting rebinding because generally your connections gonna die after a finding so essentially if I\u0027m just detecting that I am behind a NAT what is going to influence are my decisions about like keep alive timeouts I think also there\u0027s when we\u0027re talking about lying I think it\u0027s much easier if you are lying to assume that you\u0027re going to get a mismatch of your addresses someone randomly guessing what your public IP address really is that you think it is is probably a lot harder to do so it may be easier to detect and trust that you\u0027re not actually behind a net so you\u0027re saying that you use it specifically just to detect that you\u0027re behind a mat and not try to do anything with the address right I mean the other exactly the only thing you could detect and trust is that you\u0027re not behind it or that somehow your public IP address really is visible this is where as this information is leaked out of the time for this particular topic I think we ought to continue the discussion on the list and move to the next sorry folks thank you hello everyone my name I come from a hobby today I\u0027m going to introduce our dropped using I didn\u0027t hear the Republic key or TRS yeah the the this relaxing experience our motivation actually with the feel T as 123 I support using your public key yeah you "
