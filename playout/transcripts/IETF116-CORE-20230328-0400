I've got three and a half minutes. So I'm gonna just go the next part. So this is the other big part that I was wanted to present to you today. So which was basically a review from klaus talking about how this mechanism in in this in this draft is actually clashing with the way of works. We discussed this at one meeting, but I'll just come back to this and and see what the what the solution that we're proposing is. So So the the main issue is that conditional attributes the way it's written right now. All the way observe are sent, which means that certain clients that receive representations of the actual resource we'll no longer get the notifications as the Observe was intended to. The proposal was that instead of interfering under what conditions and the way the server is vacations to drop define house updates resource dates how the client can influence this and the para a good way apparently resource a projection. So using resource protection, then the new test can be observed by the client. So just a background about what resource state protection is. It's it's"

As a means to reduce payroll response. So the implication of using state production with conditional attributes is this basically when a server receives a request containing condition attributes, this is basically query parameter. The server provides a resource state of the client, that we just separate from the the origin resource state requested with our condition metric. So essentially are talking about a virtual And if I want to represent this, in terms of a sequence diagram. So let's assume that client a is communicating with server that is providing a resource call C, which we delivers the the actual values of Carbon talks animations. And sets an observe relationship. So client eight sets up also relationship and then whenever the resource day changes, then the server delivers the the actual state representation. A client b wants they use conditional attributes. So it's asking for the same resource but append the resource with query parameter called greater than one thousand Dbm. So Obviously, the the server will acknowledge that. Register the the interest and then it proceeds to eventually provide the resources projections. So which basically means that for client a, client able will continue to get in that sense the the the the resource C two whenever it changes and and client b is essentially being given the resource estate protection. So this this is the idea that we are going forward with And I think that this appears to also satisfy the the request for a slide rewrite about this."

I'm sorry that I'm I'm just twenty seconds, but it's about cancellation. How do you cancel the registration? And So with when you look... When you look at the Rf seven six four one for for observe there's there are basically two ways to do that. Firstly, the client can just essentially forget the the the registration and the and whenever the server a new response then you get a reset message. So that's that's kind of like the the way that you can do. The other way is that the clients sends an observe option with value one. But now if we are talking about resource projections, then I would propose that the way we do registration cancellation and that the draft could recommend is that you do the cancellation but you should have the condition attributes the Uri. Would that be sensible? Any comments. Just an analysis, yes, very responsible. I think Christian said something. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Kristen. Okay. That's it.

So as a quick recap, publishers grab go up. Essentially consist on using tie publishers and subscribers that use coop methods on your eyes to let's say that use this type of broker based architecture you have constant notifications and constant traffic being received by the subscribers. So then and And that's the high level view. This broker but I mean, this image maybe I will have to update it because the this transcription doesn't really happen always on the broker. Is not broken dependent. You can subscribe to our resource that host tells were but. For the sake of the presenting, this is enough Now the new things is the in this Api overview, the new things are the resources structure.

It's it's maybe it it's well defined, but maybe we could have more features there. But anyway, that's that's done buy a topic administrator. No. This is necessarily by the publisher subscriber. Next... So this topic data resource has basically this published subscribe communication pattern and is what the... The previous draft basically was about. So for those who have been implemented implemented the previous draft, you be very trivial to adapt to this new one, but they would maybe have to implement the topic configuration part. Operations as you know, like the subscription is with observe option. To enable it or to unsubscribe and the publication is the book... Yeah. I mean, the a explanatory. Another new thing or a a clarification here is the topic life cycle. Because a topic now in in is in a sense two resources not just one. The state of both resources matter order to know whether our topic is actually created or not. So for example, a topic configuration the moment you created a configuration the in the red. Area there. You do a post operation with a set of parameters to configure this topic. Like, you say, these are the resource types, Media type. This is type of you may say also this is the topic data uri that you can use to subscribe. But you don't have to. The broker may create it for you as in case.

So then we go to the fully created state, which is when a publisher actually published something there, like for instance there, you have a a measurement of the current temperature. And at that point, it is fully created and subscribers subscribe to it. In the half created stage, you get the four zero four in the fully created you get the actual values and... Yeah. And you move back and forth, For example, if you leave the topic data, you go back to have created you full topic configuration, then basically, you leave the topic itself. On... Yep. This is a workflow example. Maybe to have more time for the discussion this is keep it, but is also pretty straightforward? Yeah. We had well, I implemented this basically during the hack.

The case of non operating proxies it's a little bit different because we discussed during the last meeting that if we have cash proxy, the measurement will not be possible. So according to this consideration, we define the performance measurement option as proxy and save. That means that is unsafe for forwarding the that does not understand it because if we have no collaborating proxy, it's... The measurement will not be possible because the beach the information would be meek after the proxy and the things will not work in that case. So the simple approach is to say okay, the perfect performance mass measurement of is proxy safe in any case and in case of non proxy, and no and non cash and cash proxy, the measurement is not possible. But we also consider that an implementation may consider the performance measurement option has saved to forward if the proxy are non caching because if the proxy are non cash the measurement will work if one client is the only node that is done measurement. The case but this is let's say, a case, we may omit. The in the future words version of the draft. We just mentioned that and implementation may consider. This case.

That being said, I think this document also ready for a working group option, I would personally just prefer if this were handled in Ip. Because there seems to be a general perception whether that's a good thing or not as a different matter. That documents coming out of core are endorsed or recommended things to do with coop and we've seen drop in the other direction, trouble with people picking up things that wendy individual documents the registered good options are no response for example.

But in this case, I can share my experience with them because I already have several a couple of rf in Ip, and I sometimes when you just did the normal approach is to go on the specific working group to standardize the application of any T meet for a particular protocol for example, I really recently published and about the application of the marking method two ip six and the draft was fully managed six months, but I agree with you so I need to be aware of this work so maybe we can... We can if the draft will will be in some way. Adopted or the adoption code will start I I we suggest you putting copy also I, of course, then. Yeah. So with respect to which vehicle we group does this we had an interchange with Ip, so we tried to to push it over the fence and it was pushed. Yeah.

But they have previously have some privileges by which they can access the devices, but they are just not These are these just don't happen to use other protocols that we that we usually use. So for these cases, we can use alternative transport, which work quite well and up. The previous draft dash two turned out to have some problems that I've some of which I've had already addressed in Three. In particular that D just didn't... Work precisely as I expected. But also that it didn't have role rust, which was a known issue. And that that is that it might need some additional mechanisms based on the implementation experience gathered. The new mechanism...

The main issue is that when you're in a situation where you have just the most basic set of low energy operations.

Can we multi multitask at in the other because devices can stand out beacon messages really sorry they call it advertisements but on in radio terminology there can they can do that really really cheaply. So we can use that. But I think this should not be part of the original plan.

So from a centralized point of view, call controller, we can manage different of Iot d device or things?

And then once we have that, obviously, they're we will establish the security association there. Can send targeted information to the things. To exchange information in a secure manner. By using that hog or just only. So regarding the registration or the onboarding part, so so said this there is a authentication process at the beginning, and then our assumption is the the thing is controlled by the central entity in a secure way. So once we have that, then we can proceed with with a our proposal here And we present two cases, The first case is assuming the thing has the at hot score implementation. So we have defined a agenda model to model that at hoc information that needs to be configured from the from the unemployed. So using that that just the model Core, for example, my interface, we send that configuration to the sync A and the sync date So they can run and hog after that configuration is say that. And then from that, account and then they can protect the communications. Another case is where we don't have the at heart in implementation in the things. So just score."

And some kind of policy we have adi when to protect the access to particular resource that required our protection and The connection information is required to establish doc. And to establish those core context to protect exchange. And the other model Is yes border score So assuming as it's a case two, just. Post score in the notes and the things. So we provide us you can see the context, the common information around the recipient. We have added the also a policy, when to protect certain resource. If that resort needs to be productive with corps, then we refer in the policy to the oscar context. That the only has computer in the thing. This is just an example. I won't go into the details that essentially is the mapping of agenda model for the case.

And what we have now is very simple proof of concept, only for the case two. We are working on the case model as well. So for the implementation, we have the library I is working on that. From yeah, placebo library. So we send that information in signed format to the to the notes. So we're using a implementation for the controller of the things. And to establish the communication between the notes, we have the migrant hog micro. So we just the similar information. We're received the notes. That feeds the migrant dog score... Micro implementation so to run the the security between that So that's the status right now. So our idea is to extending in the time models. To include for example, different extension to score or kudos or the communication and and everything. Or new things in that org that might be required.

Or is that something that we could leave out of and what the be. No. It's our our assumption here is at least Obviously, in the general way, we we have defined the the junk the model But assuming the the Iot base is constraint, our our thoughts is are going to use Comma to provide all the information to to the notes.
