    "text": "same person had sort of made sense because these are the entities that are pumping the content into the network to words they use equipments the devices that consume the content so it\u0027s very important to select the egress path in accordance with what the criteria might be to serve that content correctly to that UE at that point of time as we know ninety more than 90% of content online and it flows from server to the UE they use equipment so this really worth solving a problem from the uese point of view in a way yeah because they\u0027re if they have multiple interfaces then they got to select the right interface which would dictate the right IP address which then in turn would dictate what the server needs to set up the path but again I\u0027m scratching my hand thinking that we need to describe the problem with a little bit more context or what what what\u0027s really worth for us to tackle is it really the u east side mm-hmm is it really the server side where the content flows the most where the path characteristics are a lot more important is that is that a question or is that a comment absolutely comment and a question it\u0027s a question is what I think there I think there are a lot of different sort of provision architectures for various services I think that one thing that\u0027s missing from that vision of the world is any interactive video which is hard and one of the places where I\u0027d expect path awareness gives you the biggest win I think that there\u0027s a there\u0027s a an insight in your comment about maybe for the content delivery stuffs a lot of this is already solved I mean by by just engineering within the network you don\u0027t need to know a whole lot than where the UE might be but if the UE can assist in doing that selection in a path aware and a path aware way that you get from your you know your 85% good to your 95% good that might be worth looking at I think that that CD ins are like content delivery in general is somewhat less challenging also because we put a lot of brainpower in it over the past 20 years right so I think there are emerging applications that will benefit from this more sure I actually think the end point is also very important because the problems there is sometimes more trickier when you\u0027re talking about servers you\u0027re mostly thinking about how can I put more bandwidth for endpoints it\u0027s like wired Wireless 3G multi-home course with different addresses some of them might not be usable at all and if endpoint couldn\u0027t reach a content delivery system doesn\u0027t matter how much effort we put in to pass awareness on servers yeah certainly that\u0027s true but if the client happens to have only one interface you\u0027d get to the network all bets are off but if the client has more than one then I agree then there is a need for again "

Dawkins again I\u0027d like to speak in support of Mirrors suggestion - I do the survey is like he\u0027s like one of the first step so if the research group takes on I think that there\u0027s been a real aspect of this stuff that basically it\u0027s like ooh I touched that it\u0027s hot and I\u0027ll never touch anything that looks like that again so the ability of the ability of the people who have worked on stuff to pass on what they\u0027ve learned has been really limited I think that I think that that would have some several positive impacts but I think just collecting them would be worth it if you didn\u0027t do anything else with them I think just for a better understanding of what we\u0027re looking at I am really excited about what y\u0027all are doing here and if this looked to me like one of the research groups that could easily be passing stuff over to the IETF as this time goes on because I think we\u0027re you we\u0027re talking about stuff that people are doing today but trying to find ways that they can do it much much better so it\u0027s really research not engineering so gory first I\u0027ve often complained about people doing the same as IETF working groups but I think this is exactly what we need to do I think we need to have research here that attracts all the things that aren\u0027t being done in other working groups so we have somewhere to put it and the reason is because I think the Internet has changed that big black box is no longer the shape it used to be lots of things have changed even just ecmp so as a transport guy I have little clue know about what\u0027s going on in the middle and it\u0027d be really good to know something if the question is just what is it I might want to know that I think would be a really useful outcome so I like the work thank you hi Aaron fuck fuck my the talk on Sian reminded me of some works I did a few years ago on a system called fara which was about enabling end-users to to use I guess an anachronistic metaphor choose their own long-distance carrier in networking "

Allison Lincoln the jabber room person for a moment actually Allison I think this is is traditionally where you come up and have your say as the IRT F chair yeah but I first time we\u0027ve done what I\u0027ve done they proposed research group and you as as people know the the or don\u0027t know RFC is 74 18 kind of has our informal approach which is that we can have a year of proposed research group once you\u0027ve gotten to this point without actually chartering it formally so I don\u0027t know whether Loras took hums or anything like that my own you were going to have some review by some of the I star just to give us some perspective I heard a lot of positives here I heard a very good organization of the material I did hear some questions about transfer versus routing and the fact that we scheduled this badly means that we not on purpose we didn\u0027t have a choice means that we don\u0027t have we have all lot of transport people but not routing people in the room but we can fix that one thing I\u0027d like to know is do people feel we\u0027re going to have to also will have to be very careful to avoid ipv6 related conflicts it sounds like as well this may turn out to be one of those groups is extremely hard to schedule but so I don\u0027t know that we need to ask a question I think people should use the mailing list and there\u0027s three two more meetings ahead and the year of work and then we\u0027ll see where things are we find the Charter do some work let\u0027s see see where things are okay cool thank you very much and thank you to speakers and everybody who huh hi and the participants and to all of you and we will see you on the list which is pan RG @ ir t f4 just a request if we can get the presentation uploaded to the material because I wasn\u0027t able to find the first one by only there so we we posted like the we posted Lydia is quite late that that\u0027s up on the CD in now so like it was it wasn\u0027t quite everywhere so try again later and if you still can\u0027t find it mail us I could actually see it currently on the agenda so should "
