    "text": "the question at the end would be well okay if if the Gold\u0027s are not really that clear a kind of an evaluation simulation or whatever what what you what you get out of expected usage models just just just doing just inventing a new metric per se is a nice intellectual exercise but I\u0027m not seeing what it is really good for okay sorry for that for the first question the goal is to develop a new metric that combines three different values other IG B\u0027s don\u0027t use that they use only one or two factors together for example CIJ RB uses the least bandwidth and the total delay but never uses the number of hops and total delay and the total bandwidth together I think there is no more factors that influence it choosing the best route this is the something new that Neb adds well why not call why not include also as a fourth metric and a new exercise the financial cost of using a link service the financial cost of what yes well okay kind of kind of you might actually be using a user\u0027s charged service for establishing one of the links and there might be short delay high cost for that yeah well okay kind of kind of you were saying well okay I wanted to do something with more parameters in the game than we used before I can I can extend that exercise a couple of times a synonym yeah I think what I really asked for and I should have asked for is what benefits are you going to get out of this new metric over the current IG piece okay if we will go on like you could you know if somebody wanted to do this with the existing eye a GPS you could use it do it using the new flex algorithm draft okay we can discuss that on the mailing list I think the first question on the benefits though that that\u0027d be good to have it what benefit are you going to get out of an aggregate metric with these three things that would be okay okay let\u0027s go to the complex figure that "
