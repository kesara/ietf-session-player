I don't see Alan in the room, but we have some comments or 2 open questions there around a dedicated well known port. I think, Ned, you comment out there and whether or not we wanna allow the obfuscation in the TLS tunnel or channel. We would like to this was one of the things that we've been pushing on for a while.

We also want to evaluate the base model supports key requirements that too much. For a specific layer, we modeled multiple layers from layer tool up to the customer service layer, and we want to see how easy it is to extend the base model to support new technology. and can the base model be augmented fairly newly new technology. So you can see here on the right, I won't go through it different technologies that we evaluated during this box. Next, please. So if you can see here the activity in the IETF and over 60 modules that augmenting the the core IETF network topology models. So there are modules that are different activities there. These are the ratified modules.

Next, please. survive digital tiltrin is defined in the and please look there for the definition of the digital twin. It collects different data. It stores different data.

We also identified requirements for the till map. And as you can see, basic 6 requirements are already supported by the RFC, and that's one of the reasons why we picked RF CA 3 45 as a basis for the digital modeling.

So IETF network topology model only have unidirectional and does not support by direct No. It only supports point to point connectivity, not multi point connectivity. It doesn't allow links between different networks at the last longer links inside the network. there are some supporting relationships that are not allowed like what we needed during the our analysis and prototyping STP to nodes supporting a node network. We think we need to add semantics to some relationships supporting relationship to specify the context is also termination point roles. I'm missing layers and sublayers. There is further analysis that they could be modeled through Netflix at types, we had to look at tunnel and parts and undelete because RFC 8795 defines those additionally to the 8345. So we need further analysis to see that approach should be used. Next, please. Some high level of reservations As I mentioned, we modeled digital mapping 2 different labs. we allowed of augmentation of different layers and technologies. And the the beside the limitations that we found, there are some open issues that we are still investing gating. In some cases, there is a need for separation of layer 2 and layer 3, but some cases. the operators want a kind of unified layer then layers versus sub layers, then generic IP routing with parts versus basically is PFI size. same technology a different layer, for example, multilayered for BGP on delay versus VPN BGP layer.

Why the name digital map digital twin evokes a kind of this is my test. This is going to model a production, a real device, and I it seems to me that this work is more than just about doing doing lab or or simulations. It's more about a holistic service and topology type of of model or service and apology type or service and and physical, logical network topology. Then we looked at the digital trend, we saw lots of models and and and they are you now? And they were in assurance, configuration, provisioning all of it. But how do you combine all these different data and models. How do you put them together. Like, we started looking at intent assurance initially, but then there was a feedback from the providers, you know, we want to see the data in the context of layer network topology. So that's the core reason. If you look at one function, of ancile or or even configuration, traffic engineering. It all goes back to those play it. Play it. Play it. apologies. So we thought if it come up and propose this this core lay it next to apologies that that's the way how all these things could be played brought together. And as a target the closed loop.

We've been counted over many years, many cases of multi points bidirectional, semi unitirectional bidirectional, etcetera. cases, and we've also got models that support that sort of structure in other bodies. So the proposal is to enhance backup compatibly, 8,000,000,000 dollars, $3,500,000,000 to support this these unibody structures in multiple structures in more a more efficient way than the current method proposed in h245.

I'll I'll I only got 5 minutes, I'll zip through this quickly. many experiences through this in multiple technologies and also in multiple device management activities.

So the but the The method used here, there are 2 methods proposed in the in the draft. 1 is to simply insert a point list in the structure low source and destination, source and destination are optional. So we can insert an optional point list and then say, okay. You can either use the point list or the source and destination. Doesn't break existing solutions they can carry on using that, but it allows us to add more sophisticated support and when necessary. The other method proposing the draft, which I haven't put in here, is to user to extract sourcing destination, then re augment them back in again. that's not compatible Yang, but it appears to give compatible adjacent instance output. So and compatible with the outputs. And then that gives more control over whether you're gonna go unidirectional point to point. I'm gonna go bidirectional. multipoint and so on. when you buy a multipoint. So you can actually control it with a feature so I can say I'm already using interaction point to point. I'm using bidirectional and multi point. So, anyway, we'll we'll work continue to work on this this Yang to improve this in following drafts, and then, hopefully, we can proceed. Next slide, please. Next. Thanks. So the just to emphasize the efficiency of this method. If I've got a if I use the current RSCH 45 mechanism to represent multi point bidirectional structures. And I have to use the structure on the right hand side, which has more interactional point to point links to a pseudo node structure and then provides me with a a sort of support for the multi point in this. The structure on the left is the multi point unibody thing for you. It's just a single structure with points on the edges that reference.

They're roots. So that gives me the route to route flow, the leaf to route flows, but no leaf leaf flow. And that structure is 1, of the many different options you might have for the 4 points of things, how should you describe it? The same is true to the sooner. You still have to have some kind of connectively matrix or something to explain the flow in there. So it doesn't get away with not having it just because it's sooner nodes. So this provides a much more efficient structure. And, of course, you can see it degenerates back to a unidirectional point to point if you only have two points and make it directional. So it gives you support for the existing structure if you want to, also extends it to much more sophisticated assemblies. So wish you could do the next slide, please. I thought they only have 5 minutes, by the way. I seem to have 9 Yeah. That that's what the time came out in the agenda. So I think Okay. Okay. Nice one. overall in this digital map, we might have allocated more time. So as Olga mentioned, there are other errors of improvement that we can we can look these came in independently, actually, what Old was doing and they're they're they're a good intersection of what they're doing in the digital map work anyway. So So termination point direction, it would seem beneficial to be at a state whether a termination point in the topology is actually on the unidirectional bidirectional, and that obviously then extends this to allow an understanding of compatibility between the multiplying to unibody structure and the terminations specification of capability I mentioned, I know we've got the the, I think, its connection matrix, I can just be at the name of it.

So we've got many situations where we got a link link going out of one domain into another. Richings of navigation, So the ability we've got a limited navigation RCA RCA I might wanna reach a navigation, but we then need to consider whether this is for conveying over an interface where wanna minimize the number of statements you make to convey the information. or whether it's for navigation and repository where you want to enrich number of relationships that you've speed the navigation up. we need to look at that carefully and understand what the purpose is and then maybe several focuses Also, relationships role relationships. So this is end indicating what the point, what actact. what function the point is playing in the multi point launches. So I mentioned route and leave, so a point might have a a root roll or a leaf roll. Like, we have some protection roll, etcetera. sort of the whole range of different things you wanna and again, the specification mechanism helps you to understand those. But just by simply labeling them, that gives us sufficient information about the asymmetric. We're just observing it. So and the generalized model of flow, hence, not just links, also the annual represent flow links a capability for enabling flow, whereas the statement of actual flow might be necessary again in the digital map, it depends on how what depth you wanna go to to describe the network. as to whether you need to go down this path or not.

I looked at it, you know, because it was interesting that it was obviously working in the network space, but I haven't looked at it. Could we perhaps we could talk on that? Yeah. And one idea for the from them. They said we will not model We will not have different type of links. And instead of that, we will have something called another abstraction called the in group. Sellinks are always in a directional, And if you have bidirectional or multipoint links, then you group them together. and then you can have a link group that Trevor tell you, like, okay. These are abundant together. You have to at that. Yeah. So one just a alternative idea that we might -- Yeah. That's interesting. we we I think you can sort of envisage the link here as as a link group without the need to actually state the underlying links.

Exactly. very much. Okay. Thank you, for the experience I've seen in TSMC camp, for the bidirectionals, I think the two links really lecture works perfectly because also we can easily associate them by starting and landing on the same pair of piece.

I don't see why this approach cannot work with p 12p or with multi point to multi point, it's for multi point to multi point, I think the n square is really an issue. But if you start thinking about that if you want to associate the characteristics like delay or ban reliability, maybe the s square problem is unavoidable. So it depends.

So they're very compact. If you start to get groups of points as you do in some networks that have a similar behavior another group similar behavior, but a different behavior between them group them, group them, and then put a rule in between them. So you start to get more you more richness, but not immense amounts of complexity. So it's really trying to take away the complexity from the problems where there isn't any. but allow the introduction of that as is in a sort of a sophisticated way. So if I do get a extremely asymmetric case where every single point's got a different relationship with other points. it's got that underlying, but it's still within that atomic unit. So I I capture the atomic unit as a set of points, and then I can describe all the complexity within that atomic unit rather than having lots and lots of apparently set things that I can't see the wood for the trees.

So as we mentioned this incident can be identified either based on the alarm data or based on KPI days or combination of this kind of different data number of 4, some kind of alarm data you may actually receive some you know, interface down or RGP down, actually, this may affect the service.

And so either stuff where it sort of fits okay in an ops home, work should happen here. And I think this is probably fine. I mean, you're getting operational very much use off the device. I think that fits here, but it's not the wider discussion. It's not gonna bring all the"

So so the next is a new draft concerning x part of low precision availability metrics using IP fix. Next slide, please. So, basically, the background is there is actually work on precision availability metrics that is taking place in IPPM, This is actually going now to a working group last call. This draft the the topic of this. So, basically, what this concerns is, when you have services which are governed by service level objectives, for the high precision services, the type that are being defined in dead net or being an by dead net and so forth where you have, for instance, stringent latency guarantees and so on. You want to basically know when the promise precision is available or whether when it has been not been avail or when it has been violated. And so, importantly, in this other work, basically, various metrics are being defined. However, what is not defined there is how to collect retrieve and sport those metrics. And this is basically one aspect that is being addressed here. IP fix clearly allows to ex export flow records with statistics about flows. This applies directly actually here. So therefore, basically, this strap is about extending IP fix to to export precision availability metric data. Next slide, please. So and accordingly, basically, the the the core of this is to to define these new information elements. They are basically categorized into tools, 2 sets, if you will, thing basically is information elements to reflect precision availability metrics are things such as violated intervals count, violation free violation free interval counted and and a few more. And the 2nd category are information elements which provide the required context to be able to correctly interpret or that provide a necessary context interpreting those records, such as, for instance,"

What is on is not a is relative to to the to this particular notion. Alex, we're we're way over time. We're not gonna Sorry, Thomas. You will have to go to the list. wanna give we wanna give the ops area chance. Okay. Alright. The next one is the last slide. I think their transplant So -- Yeah. I need to Might need to. Oops. Try it again. I'm sorry. 44 added it Yeah. I'm I got it. Well, It's on there. while electrified sides and things like that, there's two things I wanna point out that's that's useful. number 1, despite how much I love you all, I'm giving up in March. And so although it's got a fun ride and fun, would encourage anyone that's sort of considering standing for the ops management role to come and talk to me. there's definitely some really good positives out there. There's a lot of work to do there. you need good buying from your employers. But if you want to talk to me about what the role is like, what's what actually involves and I'm more welcome to talk to that talk about that. And the other thing I want to point out is there was a side meeting additional map stuff happening earlier this week. We've now got a mailing list set up digital map, hyphen Yang, check with Benoit if I'm not quite right. I'm also gonna be a coordination place to see if there's people interested in this work and whether you get some people sort of group of people together trying to sort of coordinate and then decide what to go forward. And would that work? That's my side of stuff. for Yeah. As Rob said, he's stepping down at the end the thing, and so we need other people. And this is the open mic time and you've only got 30 seconds. It's almost as though we planned it. 28th, 27, 26, Okay."
