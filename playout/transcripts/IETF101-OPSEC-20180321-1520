    "text": "labs that are involved and all of the vendors will enable us to provide a much better standard than in the past so there is an old document called RC 3511 which exists for 10 years was also conducted created from the benchmarking methodology working group for old legacy firewall tests I think our document is going to supersede it but of course 3511 will still be applicable for like lab based testing of traditional firewalls so I think I can skip most of that ah one one last thing maybe traffic mix actually firewalls are usually tested with a very uniform traffic like let\u0027s use as large as possible request sizes let\u0027s use as few as possible certificates and so on and this helps the vendors to typically optimize the memory in their firewalls so that the datasheet numbers are blown up or grown if you\u0027re a vendor increased so and traffic mix I will define in an NX will actually help to make this testing more realistic and will prevent this kind of optimization that is not real so we have a pretty aggressive schedule there are quite a few contributors we hope to get this through until August a couple of questions that\u0027s that\u0027s basically and based on this IRC once it might have been ratified approved we want to create a certification program so if you just go back to that so that sorry this is may sound I from University of Essex yes are you actually going to define traffic mixes based on services not actually protocols or application layer protocols are you actually going to do Google Maps cisco webex etc etc so the important part here is it\u0027s all web-based traffic\u0027s of an interrupt Enterprise parameter probably that\u0027s realistic so the important part here is to have unique certificates and those certificates are supposed to be real because that\u0027s you know and the apart from that I don\u0027t care whether it\u0027s Outlook or YouTube or whatever what counts is the number of URLs the number of domain names well I come from slightly different angle and what my interest is actually often you look at traffic mixes and they are TCP HTTP and you don\u0027t know what\u0027s the mix inside actually but security threats particularly in next-gen is more about the services that comes with organization so I\u0027m quite interested is that going to have a follow up with some traces or some data acquisition or some analysis that shows certain profiles yes and this is only the first profile so if you are interested in contributing something that would be more than welcome currently this profile is implemented in one emulator another from Spirent and other company as keysight is about to implement it and we also want to make it available publicly as capture like a peek app that can be played by a open source generator such as t-rex great I\u0027ll follow up in details later good team Jen so first of all it may be "

    "text": "a very naive question what\u0027s net SEC open you don\u0027t link to it in the drive I imagine it five times I did sorry I so it\u0027s a non it\u0027s a nonprofit organization of 501 C u.s. nonprofit and like any other industry association we need a body to host the certification program okay so my comments on the testing I don\u0027t see anything there about doing really high throughput flows in the mix with all the other daily craft for example at University campus we get something that\u0027s really big in universities at the moment is being able to push several gigabytes a second of flows through the firewall while all the other stuff goes on most universities now starting your engine in the network so the high performance stuff is redirected a different path into the network but having some measurements of existing firewalls to show just how bad their architecture is at mixing those two types of traffic would be really useful but I don\u0027t see that in there at the moment yeah that\u0027s a great comment I think we we started with a normal office normal office environment but obviously we have to look at like how much how many profiles do we actually need to to have a realistic as a growing one in University Circle okay thanks Jeff has a question and a comment the question is with ike a one of the things that\u0027s worth testing as part of these profiles well yes I think we have an ongoing discussion about which ciphers and which you know certificate which encryption options we should use I\u0027m not the best possible expert on the details but we have actually weekly call so I\u0027m happy to invite you I\u0027m not a for right I\u0027m inappropriate in advisers that I filled the second question our second observation is about your traffic mixes one of the things I strongly recommend is that you have traffic mixes that not only are you know large large Foligno large full frames that you\u0027re doing at the appropriate throughput rate of lots of small frames that are high no packet per second I mean what is generally known thing in forwarding art where is that IPPs can be more damaging than IBPS right of course mm-hmm thank you how Morten co-chair of the benchmarking methodology were in group we would really love to see all these interested parties and I know who you are show up show up and then make comments say that this draft will get adopted and now well incorporated another work plan thank you [Music] okay thank you so much for coming here Jordi\u0027s sit in the room I guess if you have any questions regarding the blockchain if you have not signed a blue sheet that\u0027s mostly now or never and see you next time in Moorhead or Montreal as you say "
