Right. So... Yeah. That's not really a good replacement for note taker. Do we have own volunteers? Either local or remote? Okay. Thank you. So What... Yes. I don't be looking at the jab room as well. So... Well, it's not the jab. The chat. You I I don't think it's going to see a lot of use. So we're going to do the draft updates. Man here about the marathon and Hack all that. And then if you during remaining works. Now as you move heard and scene at the mail with this is the last meeting It, we're not closing immediately.

The remaining graphs are discussed on the mailing list and there's... Oh, I'm to correct. Yes. So let's move to there other document? Other... To the other presentation. Premium and yeah. Let's start with the hack report. Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. This is he mentioned. Chris from Kingston University. I represent and team. To share some progress of this time hacks project. Okay.

In this hex, we had implemented the latest version of the consumer facing interface. We also implemented the latest version of registration Interface young model. Next So as you can see here, we kind of a Poc proof of concept. For this f, we put this simplify the website. Have this point registration. It has user groups device groups, location groups, ui groups, On the right hand side, we have this high level configuration. In this high level calculation, we can put different configuration intent in tension with those intention next. The the security policy will be translated to the the level policy as you can see here. We generate a general firewall, and inside has many policies Yeah. Next. What got done is that... Yeah. The older version and new version you can see here, we have in upper the figure. We switched to the net server and neck client, and we added the c in the newer version virginia is that we switched net become the security controller become the client and the Dm has become server. So we switched the This the rules and we also added a query. So the client is send security to the server and server we replied this registration interface. Next,"

To provide the high Necessary high level of information for configuration to the dia to users. The latest version of the registration interface Young simplify the architecture of the Framework. So it's allowed both the registration and query Yeah. Next, The next step the post step is that we try will try to implement security policies cycle for dynamic policy update then in this work we may try to verify security policy that performs the necessary necessary actions to ensure that request the high level security policy will be achieved we may also do some analysis of the network behavior with machine learning techniques or any other tours and we try to reconfigure the appropriate security policy. That can be monitored in real time. And next So yeah, we have uploaded the sales code to look those kind of a Poc in the kick. You can take it out. Next also have this demonstration video? If you interesting you can click this youtube. You see how it works. We... This Poc works. Yeah. Next, Do we have this team? Yeah. This time we... Yeah."

And I'm here to give you some updates on what we have done on the our last two draft the customer facing the phase and registration interface? Next, please. Yeah. First let me start with the facing interface decimal model. Please. Yeah. So one of the thing we did is we basically added a new leaf for the... How to configure the anti antivirus. Here, we added a profile, which follows the system used in the our face interface. So this profile is basically used as a denial list. So we can configure what kind of signature maybe in these antivirus for deny list and also for the exception list. We figure what is allowed, basically, allowed to go through on these antivirus.

Type three could three and eighty fifty six step one foot four. Which said is not really the best case to use. Instead we should use the to reach I instead of a host check. So in here we update the text that, basically, a package should be rejected with Sm p fifty four type three jordan and or type one code one for the S physics. This is the destination unreachable for. Administrative prohibited, which means is an example is, like I will filter, then we can use this code. Next slide, please. Yeah. Next part is for the registration interface? Yeah. As previously, Chris Already mentioned, basically, in the older version week kind have a complicated architecture. Well we kindly use the on both sides And in this new version, basically we just simplifies this architecture where. The surface is just on the Dms side. And the clients on the security control side?

Basically, where we you can see that in the improvement out we giving the yeah alternative of cover on this model? And in this first the one was combines basically the curry registration and query.

It can has multiple nsf. So if the requires a multiple nsf and this young data models allows that multiple. Next slide, please.

From the team and it's facing the face monitoring joining to interface. Facing registration interface. Yeah. Thank you. I you. Good So Hi. This is Reuben and I apologize. I didn't jump in yeah. In addition to releasing all the yang models, we also can release the applicability statement on Yes. That's right. So thank you for estimate like, how much more time like best of the process? Absolutely a fair question. So kind of stepping back, we had the document in the in the working group. The one group did last call. Publication request was submitted. I did my review, all the revisions happen. Then we went to Of last call. That has been also complete So where we are in the process is We are in Is evaluation. So that means gonna specifically, it needs to be brought to Is review. And the way that process works is every two weeks, there's something which is called the is g tele. So those documents are reviewed every two weeks. We have we... Because of the scheduling of this meeting, the next Is review is the second week in April And I'm looking... I wanna say it's like April eleventh or I'm sorry. April thirteenth, which is a Thursday. So both of those documents are gonna be on the on the ballot there. So the I has to review them by that date.

This drug is show you how the translation between the high level credit policy and policy So this is we wanted to elevate a nsf in a real world deployment. And in the Framework, we included a lot of we'll target jake like, for filter any other kind of to other And this basically this document is really try to give some guideline on what the relationship between the higher level policy which is to consumer facing interface. And also the lower level policy proceed it's just the As a interface the models. Next slide, please. Yeah. So because we as you know, there, we just... I just talk about the updates on the customer consumer facing interface. Now we just added the new guideline for this. Antivirus where we added how to to to the mapping for the Antivirus for? Next slide, please. And also the in customer consumer facing also we kind updated this how to handle geographic location where we are using a country and city. Instead of just one name.

If a certain language is used, or how if us a turn strategy and in the event it was missed the application the time of how to map the time the device and the user's mapping. Next slide, please. Yeah. So so this document is basically want to help developer if they want to know how to translate this high level into the low level. There's the target of this document. And also, we kind suggest on approach basically on how do what the architecture should be in the procedure so that people can of their own where deposit translator. And this stuff, we want to propose it as an informational draft which is I meeting is helpful for the deaf logo. So I just want to ask like, how how to proceed this because I can his closing so duties independent or maybe try to another working group. Yeah. Thank you. So I a...

Well the obvious place to ask is in six dispatch, but they're not looking for another four months. So it could be an independent submission. I mean, drugs do get approved like that. And then I don't know if it's correct to put it in work at is not part of the security area. But I guess that's part of the things that they would have to ask person and you can just ask her the mailing for sec dispatch. We don't have to dispatch things only doing that single session. So That's the good place to ask. Okay. Thank you. Right. So next up is the analytics interface young. This is the analytics interface. So Next slide, please. Yeah. So the sections of interfaces basically, in this strawberry and a diff find a new interface to handle a real time situation where, for example, if there's over now networks there's not stable.

And on both of them, we have the what the name of the Nsf and what's the problem and the solution? And then the Nsf is for the identification of what is. The problem is And what issue is currently going on in the network so that the Ns nsf need to handle. This solution is just what should be done in the network Right now. Next slide, please. Yes. So firstly in the Policy configuration and it is utilizing the Nsf facing into interface basically. There's a closed loop happened when the Nsf detect some problem that may need to be handled. And then the analyzer analyzed that It is be then they kind of things of a new way of how to the configure maybe it can be handled the configuration of the nsf. And this created hopefully, created a strength for the aggregate itself. Next slide please. And in the the other one is the fit information, this is basically to tackle another problem that may not be able to be handled by the other case? In this case, maybe we need to kinda report to the users on a certain problem maybe like the system resource. Or maybe there's a malfunction on the Nsf. Where a human is needed. So in this case,"

To security control replacing interface. Information motor. Second on update to their secret security controller pasting in a paste peer to peer use case, and hierarchical use case. Next, please.
