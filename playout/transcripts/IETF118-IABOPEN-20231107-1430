I will be talking a little bit about the IP outreach coordinator and the recent activities we have done. And then we have a invited talk, which we are looking forward to. Which will be our final topic. And of course, finally, open what is an IV open? Well, this is when IV comes and interacts with the rest of the community. We talk about the activities. That we have done in the in the recent past since the last meeting the technical topics as well as architectural topics, and basically liaisons and our relationship with other STOs as well. We do this to make sure that we are being transparent and visible to the community and also giving the community an opportunity to give us feedback on how we are doing things and what improvements can be done. To reach us we have a mailing list, and, sorry, the email, which is iv@iv. Og, will find all the IV members plus the members which are listed on the list. For open discussion, we have architecture discussed list. So we have very interesting discussions there, please continue to do that. For liaisons, we have liaison coordinator@ibdot or please use that list. For less on related queries. And now I pass on to there. Okay. Quick update on what we did since the last meeting. So we are about to, publish the workshop report for the M10 workshop that is approved already, and we're just waiting for the RFC editor to publish it. Yes.

EDM was a meeting on Monday in the lunch break. And they are working on a new document, which is about greasing. So if you're interested in greasing, please Look at the document. Please provide input, and you can subscribe to the mailing list if you missed the meeting. And then we have a new program, E Impact, Yay, So this is a venue for discussing environmental is a follow-up from the workshop we had last year. Or was it this year? Was last year. And we had a first meeting this lunch break. There was a lot of interest, a lot of participants, and there's a mailing list you can join. And I don't know if there's anything else to say. Okay. Next. This might also be of interest for you. So at the last IV Oak meeting, we were proposing a new program on identity management that was called who does and we got a lot of input. We got also a lot of people who were interested in this topic. And it generated a lot of discussion. So what we did is we also created an open meeting list, which was called, or is called identity discuss? And we tried on this mailing list to figure out what should be the scope of the program. And there was a lot of interests but we didn't find a real scope in order to make sure that the the work we can do in the program moves forward. But more importantly, it's actually that there is already work underway. We saw today, just earlier today,"

So if you think we should do something for you, these come back to us. Okay. So that's the part about programs. A quick update about renaissance just some numbers. Also, we send a liaison statement, the IRB send a liaison statement, in the last couple of months and you just recently received 1, you can look this up on your own. The more interesting news is we have a newly assigned manager for ITU SG. 15. Thank you, Deborah, for joining this position. Also, thank you John for serving previously in this position. And we have a new, W3C coordination group. So this is following, the pattern that we also have for other liaison work where both of the leaders from us to them as well as a leadership from the other organization to us. Together, share this group in order to have a more frequent change about over topics of overlap. So that also is now, in place for WCC. And then, last on this slide, we have the liaison coordination office hours in the lunch break on Thursday, if you have any further questions about Liaison Management. Wuxup. One more exciting topic. We have, an upcoming workshop in January, about barriers to internet access of services. The scope of this workshop is kind of answering the question. What does it means for user to be connected to the internet. What are the barriers? What are the different barriers in terms of filtering and blocking, but maybe also device constraints.

My name is Peter Kope, and I happen to be your liaison manager for ISOTC46.

Almost everything, but electrics and electronics which is covered by IEC and you will find that other organization further down there. It was founded in 1947. It's headquartered in Geneva. It's an association under Swiss law and its members are National Standards Bodies. To they are currently, I think, 167 Countries represented in their and these these, standards organizations center experts the various committees. The ISO is structured into technical committees and then they are further sub structured into subcommittees or and or working groups. Technical committees might look like IETF Areas and at very abstract level. They might resemble those, but they have a completely different type of logistics and more boundaries between them it's an organizational unit. We'll get to that TC46 in a minute. Important part is about the liaisons. ISO. Knows, various types of liaisons that's internal ones between the technical committees and working groups, especially flavored one with partner organization, the intellectual electronic commission, that does the electronic standardization, and to external bodies. And, once such external bodies is indeed the IETF, or represented by ISOC in the particular case. That's an implementation detail for the moment. And we have a so called, type a or class a liaison, which is kind of a platinum membership. Because not only can we attend the meetings, gets to the documents We cannot vote because that's the, privilege of the national of the members of the standard bodies, but we can could comment on the work"

So what what does I OTC 46 do you see they have their own secretariat, which is run by the French National Standards Organization so that responsibility is usually distributed cross different contributing nations or contributing organizations. In this case, again, the French, They provide the secretariat support and logistics for that techniques committee. The scope is, and I'm need to read it from here. The scope is basically anything archiving There are lots of librarians and archivists in there and we'll come to some of the subcommittees later But we need to keep in mind that, this is this is kind of an organizational umbrella only for the park that do the real standardization work. Of this 167 standards bodies I mentioned, roughly a quarter 42 are represented in TC46. So Yeah. As I said, it's mostly about identifiers and so on and so forth. And one important standard, I will get to later next slide, please. So there are a couple of standards in there that people here might remember, the Dublin core, for example, which was, very much a topic in the IETF, like, 30 years ago when we had not only URI but also URAs and URCs and things like that. I'm pretty sure that Sam will remember. Which is in 1 sub committee sub committee 4, and there's a lot of under other standard that are done there.

In contrast to what we do with the RFCs where we don't keep the number might be just as I'm counting forward. The other committee, or one other committee is sub committee 9, that has a couple of, interesting standards. Which, is so much about things that aren't really, internet related, like the international standard book number, standard serial number and so on and so forth. And you can see that These are standards that then obviously have something to register, you know, that for the ISBN, for example, all the publication houses get their own number. So indeed, there is kind of an equivalent ayana, to the Ayana function within ISO, except that it is not centralized. It is distributed and then student, again, run by the appointed, the respective appointed national standards organization or other bodies. But other than that, those standards that require registration will will need that function. Next piece, And here you will find a number of, technical standards going back. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Those standards are dealt within working groups they are under the responsibility of the secretariat and you find a number of standards that deal with transliteration of languages and scripts into Latin or vice versa.

The work that can be followed here is in a particular working group to work on that standard, and the same is true for the others. Okay. Next please. Now for the news, no no news is, good news in this case, I believe, for the previous year, there were no real comments to submit to any, of the ballots that, were provided because it was not relevant for, for ATF work, not obviously relevant. There was no colliding or overlapping work, which is one task the liaison manager to look at or look into and all of this in TC46 and remember the IETF has, really as well as to other ISO committees as well. Most of this work would naturally be, relevant for what what what earlier was the apps area. Now the part of the art area like identifiers, anything about naming, internationalization and URLs schemes, and the likes. And that's basically it. Any questions, So we already have, question in the chat about document access. Because it's always an interesting one. And let me start and you correct me if when I'm wrong. So when when you talk about we have document access, it's basically first of all, you have document access our liaison managers to all the TC groups have document access, but they have it in order to use it within the organization, but they cannot publish it. So that's a challenge for us because we are an open organization. And we don't have membership. We don't know who who is part of our organization and who's not however, the process we we are usually using here is"

Right. Yeah. Perfect. Just, just as a reminder, significant part of the income comes from selling those standards, which and, which is why this and others is OS maintain their copyright and and control the distribution. And like Maria said, if there is a documented need the liaison manager may distribute the document and we would always consult with the IAB in that case. So we don't violate the contract, the copyright and we don't, get kicked out of Zd is all, relationship, which would be bad. But in any case, if there's some serious, or demand useful demand, especially for documents in progress. Makes more sense more often, than contact me or the IAB liaison was it management? Coordination. Or any any of the other liaison managers? Thank you. There's actually a follow-up question. Is it the same process for submitting comments? That's an interesting question the comments So, I mean, I guess my take is our lease option is kind of for the community. Yeah. That's that's true. For that, I think in the extreme, we could actually, if if there is some related work say, which is what this liaison management is all It says related work. We would likely be able, but I would have to confirm how that works on the formality side, we could probably a point, an explicit expert to one of the subcommittees or working groups. And then"

I don't think Well, the commons Well, that part of the that part of the works in progress, like the so called ballads and the responses to them, they are behind that behind the gated access. So, again, the distribution, the distribution can only be in a controlled manner that may have just described. Okay. Lots of this, all all what I showed you can see in the open. So, you know, what it is. They also have business plans for that. They really call it that way. For the technical committees to kind of look into this there's also this so called online browsing platform where you can see many information about that, but you usually cannot get, freely to the work in progress and the final standards because money Yeah. So, and I guess if you are in doubt, just talk to Peter. Thank you very much. Or talk to one of the other, isolation managers if this is a different group you're looking at. Yeah. Yeah. K. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I'll just quickly give an update on, recently, IB created a new role, IB outreach coordinator, are aimed with this role was so that we can do better planning coordination and better tracking of the outreach activity, especially the one that is undertaken by the IT of Leadership, the role also involves coordinating with the rest of the leadership a person with ILG as well as the gen area, we have EO direct rate.

So I'm gonna hear, I'm gonna talk to you a about what we're seeing, from a Microsoft perspective in terms of, not just nation states, the organized crime.

And, of course, these days, what we see is that they don't necessarily go after the protocols. Of course, they do. Especially when we're talking about OT environments, operational technology environments, there's a lot of work that goes into actually thinking about how to compromise those. But as Microsoft, If you've ever heard of the Jericho form, you know, that 0 trust networking was something that was by them years ago, but essentially it's a little bit polarized from the point of view of the the industry at the moment, Microsoft is really looking at from an identity perspective, identity first, by the way, not last, not only, I should say. Okay? Others are looking at from the network protocols up. Right? And I think it's true to say that there is, benefits from both views, but from hours, what we see is that the attackers really have moved over to thinking about what is the easiest way to do some So we have the same, which basically is attackers don't break in, they log on, right, because if they can can go after the identity then that's what the attackers are going to do because it's lowest, total cost of ownership. having put my pitch out there, So essentially, what I'm going to do really is give you a a couple of what we're seeing from the point of view of, the industry overall, anybody who heard of the Microsoft Digital Defense Report And everybody's read a 180 pages of the thing. No, I'm sure not but essentially, it's, it's really a way for us to encapsulate what we're seeing with all of that huge amount of"

But essentially then give you some, case studies from the point of view of what we see in that's helped support this as an argument because the other consideration is if you are an organized organization that's been compromised, why you care whether it's nation states or not? Right? There is a reason to attribute. We attribute very carefully as Microsoft, from a, obviously from a legal perspective, maybe a legal perspective, but in terms of organizations who've been compromised the shoe doesn't really matter so much as the what. Okay? And one of the things I've I've seen over the course of my 10 year in this industry, is the fact that, you know, organizations, potentially will say, or it was a nation states that attacked me.

I'm a little bit of 2 minds about this, from the point of view of numbers because successful identity attacks as a victor, a targeted phishing attempt is a vector. How do they get into the organization? And then successful, ransomware encounters and business email compromise potentially are the outcome or the result of those. K? Nation state streets, I'm not gonna go into this too much to say, you know, fundamentally we look at each each one of those different, nation states and then see whether or not they what they're doing and then report that as part of this, some information as well. So this, again, is the MDDI port, the next couple of slides, I'm basically gonna be walking through some of the mistakes stuff But we can tell you, of course, that there's a huge amount of, focus on critical infrastructure, obvious reasons. And again, this is where we see the really technical protocol driven attacks and, you know, basically going, you know, after proprietary software and and stuff happening. Right. As I mentioned, cyber mercenaries, if you can't build it yourself. Then how somebody do that. So we saw a massive upsurge in in public sorry, private offensive capabilities organizations who who sell that sort of information, So you can expect to see this, happening. And as I say, that basically makes it a little bit difficult for us to tell whether or not, you know, these guys have a a motive of purely, nation states attacks, whether they specifically go in after nation states assets or have that sort of motivation, as opposed to some of the guys who go off to things like cambling,"

Has anybody heard of this? Diamond model of intrusion analysis essentially as the way that we pinpoint and pull together all of the different attack I don't want to say just indicators of a compromise because they change very quickly, but indicators of attack. Sort of things that we see them use over and over again. So if they're using a weaponized oh, I don't know, PowerShell, for example, then it's likely they're gonna keep on doing that. So those tools and tech 6. Make up what we know about the threat actors. Okay? From our perspective, infrastructure is something that from a DCU perspective, of a game, we can very quickly focus in and drill down on. So we'd like to think of where we can pull any of these, this information. Of course, as I mentioned, doing the sinkhole for that information and being able to pull, the data art and basically take the infrastructure away from the attack So if we can do this quickly and make it something that the attackers have to keep on spinning up new infrastructure, which I know they can, but it's, quickly as we can do this, makes it much more harder, much harder for be able to, continue doing what they're doing. So these similarities we can pinpoint, we see that overlap not just the fact that we look at focus on staff mission objective, but basically a profit objective and focus on effectiveness Oftentimes we see what looks like 2 different actors inside the network, but in fact, on normally the a team and then hand it over to the b team, or I've now managed to take away everybody's intellectual property that I was after. I've managed to, achieve my action on objective, then let's think about it right in some way. Because in many times, the ransomware is the first time that the organization understands that they've been hacked. If you think about it, jolly difficult when you've just had everything encrypted or deleted because it's 10 rounds of uptake to be able to go back and look at the timeline and do that investigation.

And then, oh, so I stuck this in there just to say that whenever we talk about doom and gloom, We also want to think about how we're going to fix that. So we come up with a set of recommendations for thinking about how we we raise that total cost of ownership for these tackers because we really want them to sweat for their money. K? Not just log on and and run wild. So that's there for you to to have a look at it a little bit later. Onyx lead, which was forming the plutonium, again, has financial and is the as large motives So if you think about the fact that they looked at the online gambling, web we're really doing a lot of targeted attacks around that perspective but then also thinking about, some of the law project vulnerability that they use And if I said log4j, Hue in this room, that's what I'm talking about.

So one of the things that we did released as part of this MDDR was something called re called return on mitigation framework. Right? So what do you get? What banged you of for your buck do you get by using some doing some of these things? Alright. And that makes it a little bit clearer in terms of this makes sense to do this because it's feel easy to do and doesn't cost me a huge amount of money, but I huge return on on, or risk reduction from that perspective. But these are the things that we think about, obviously, from the point of view of authentication, and I know they're going after multi factor authentication. Okay? It's a war. It's what we do. Just keep fighting this war. Essentially thinking about, again, it doesn't make it the wrong thing to do. Right? There's some work that we have to do from an identity perspective. So for one of the streams that we have from the secure futures initiative is really thinking about how we protect identities going forward. We can put a lot of engineering time into that as well. Apply 0 trust principles, as I said, thinking about where those, controls are and not body in the ocean, then also thinking about using extended XDR these days extended detection of response that's a new phase everybody loves loves to talk about right, but essentially getting this platform of signals and putting it together into an observability platform. So that if you get indicators of attack, then you can apply them to a graph because once upon a time, people I think it was John Lambert who said anybody who know, as defenders, we we think in less attackless thinking graphs, Right?

That the main difference, between nation state hackers and criminals is, of course, they have different goals. Criminals usually go for money. Nation state actors have different standards. But I guess there's also different in, like, resources or scale or whatever Can you come comment on that? 10. You know, that that in the past would have been absolutely correct, and that's still something that we're seeing today happening from the point of view of you know, if I can, I I can get money and make it quickly, then, you know, personally for my perspective, I think I'm on I'm on the wrong side of that ethics equation? Never gonna make any money.

So, I'm curious at what you see as your own difficulty you had a good source of list of of types of things that, you know, you try and get addresses from and domains from and, and all these types of things that must be an increasingly in difficult challenge. I know, you know, there's agencies within the United States that have a program called going you know, trying to deal with, how do, how do you doing that?

I'll phone a friend, and we can come mean, you know, from my perspective, I think there's, there's a lot to say, to say about encryption. And certainly in one of the talks that I went to just recently, they were saying, oh, you need to use encryption to combat ransomware. And it just doesn't, does it? It's, you know, you encrypted as much as you along with AKE and encrypted as well. And I know that this is not a question. I'm giving my brain some time to work, actually. Might waste a long time. I can offer you a data point that will help your thinking if you which is one of the studies they did was looking at what malicious are using in terms of protocols. And what I found was though the rest of the world is going to HTTP is too much of a pain to set up, you know, malware repositories over because you have to create the certificate and then actually get it. It's actually So 90% of the traffic I was studying actually went over HTTP. Right. So isn't that a game bypassing the controls because people find it really go for it. I mean, you know, to your point, we spent a lot of time and if they're trying to convince people that HTTPS was the right thing to do, you know, for the little lock in one corner and, know, don't, don't go to this. And in fact, plenty of times, we we block people from going to those because we we believe him to be malicious domains. And that's still, you know, I think we've done a good job of training people to say yes, right? So even though you get these prompts that say don't do or are you sure you really want to do this? Like, yes, I really want to do that. But I think the the encryption, of course, from the point of view back to transform again is what it does do is stop you having to notify the ICO because now you've got a data breach because if that information's encrypted already, that's a good thing. To your point, it then gets to the point where we're starting to think about quantum and what that's gonna do from perspective, but also the ability to offload those cycles in many ways because one of the things that we didn't we don't talk about that much is"

I've had people ask me, you know, can you can you confirm or guarantee that this encryption Kia is going to be safe for, for, what, 10 years? I can't even guarantee it's gonna be safe for 2, right, or 2 months because what's the best way to, you know, still or undo the encryption is basically still the key, right? So all of those Did you know Tars and and, the fact that they went off to the tickets themselves to be able to create their own key. That was one of the ways that they bypassed it. So I think there's many ways for them to be able to wiggle around, as opposed to going directly to the hard part of that equation. Yeah. Somewhere in there, I'm sure we'll get to an answer. Thank you. Thank you, Wes. So flow? Yep. So short. Hi. Flow Driscoll UK NTSC. Thanks very much for a really interesting presentation.

And I think what many people here do is networks in, in line with the previous question, then I think what can be done on, network protocols to to help fighting this. And and again, I want to reiterate that we don't think that the network isn't a them. We just, you know, most security people come from a networking background. I mean, didn't we all? Right. So I think that there was a lot of focus on the on the network but the problem that we have, of course, as I said, if if the identity or anything So, you know, people going after Microsoft Word, for example, or living off the land techniques. There's plenty of ways for them to be able to do that that don't acquire them to do the deep level, sort of attack it at that sort of niche work, because Again, you know, people say to me, teach me how to hack. Right.

Which doesn't need to say that the network isn't a problem. So again, what I'd like to see is more people thinking about, Well, you know, we're talking about micro segmentation these days, right, which I think maybe with the power of the cloud, we've got that capability. But again, it was one of the things I've seen talked about in the industry for many years, and nobody could ever do it because it was just too hard to do. And but, you know, maybe democracy and segmentation is the way forward now. How about that? Yeah. 1, not so Not less. About that. Okay. What's your solution? Well, my my work is focusing on routing security, so that's that's a bit of a different area, you know, securing, data and transit, in terms of where it goes, And I think there's there's quite some, debate about trust in house networking. So whether you should have a part of the network that is a bit more trusted than others, but Well, well, maybe we can take this up. Well, and I think that's half the problem is, you know, back in the day, we very much came from the point of view of if it was internal, we had all the firewalls, you know, we knew we There was a perception of control.

Do you think I think as often as I possibly can, but it doesn't work up very well sometimes. So yes, and thank you for the translation. You know, there was always that encryption date dating terms that should be encrypted and it and and then, you know, sometimes you had to pass gateways that you'd have to decrypt it and then pass it on and then we and that sort of thing.

So you've got to have that foundational capability there before you start thinking about privacy. Of course, one of the things that I wish that we did, I mean, GDPR did a great job from a security, from a privacy perspective, right? Really sits on very high boundaries in terms of what, the requirements were and very explicit, by the way, about what those requirements were for, for privacy. We don't have that in cybersecurity. We've got something like a 140 different regulations coming down the the line over the next year. Also.

We kind of need something of a cybersecurity perspective. But in a way, if we think about data as being, the new substrate, for all of this stuff. One of the things we talk about a lot is is mesh and fabric. Right?

You know, like, down below this layer, not our problem up above that layer. Not our problem, which I think is causing us a problem in in dealing with security threats exactly, as you said, because Lake, the other side doesn't put themselves in this box. Yep. Right? They are incentivized to not think about the boxes at all. Indeed, it is at those box layers that there's, like, interesting stuff to be done.

I did wanna ask one very quick question or something you said really that that really resonated with me about, like, sort of the minimum viable business or the minimum size of an organization that can meaningfully participate in the internet and be secure. Do you see a way to keep that from continuing to go up over time? If we don't, we're gonna lose. Right? So I think it's it's in our best interest to think about how we put these controls in place what we're doing, to the stock disruptors, from that perspective. But again, back to the data security perspective, thinking about how we build controls right in the beginning. You know, In in some cases, we've been remiss, for example, in terms of not switching off switching on logging or not by default switching on encryption or not by default getting rid of passwords or not by thinking about MFA for administrators because there was a cost associated with it for the customer. Right? And we, in in my view, that was their decision to take wasn't ousted to do that. And I think again, today, we're very much coming from a different perspective on that.

Right? And we don't have to do discussion. Happy to take it offline. I just wanted to to to point out, we do have Microsoft engineers here as well. And the answer here is need to come to grips with the fact that all backdoors are front doors. And all third parties are third parties. You either need to become a networking peer or you need to think about the root scenario you're trying to solve and whether breaking into network security is the right way to do it. Become the peer or think about the larger set of the problem because end to end encryption really is better. Across the board. We talk about it from a human rights perspective. We talk about it from security perspective, we talk about it from every perspective. That does mean, and I say that knowing that the endpoint then has to do more work. Get it.
