The idea is the verifiable accept the evidence if it's authenticated to the attester. That's kind of the assumption that we're making. From from a verifier's perspective as to, you know, why would it accept evidence? Reference values are set of claims that come from an RVP. Verifier accepts their reference value claims with the expectation that they will match evidence. And then endorsements, set of claims from the endorser, wherever it accepts the endorsement claims, with the expectation that the tester is valid. In other words, endorsements, are applicable if the if they apply to the a tester in question. So verifier inputs actually have a matching condition. This is maybe a new concept and what we would than what has been discussed, the rats architecture, but I'm gonna work work through some examples here. So if in an endorsement example, the attester has take the case where the the tester has a digest value called X. And there's a you see the endorsement claim that that should apply to x if if you know, that digest x is is known. So what we're saying here is The the matching condition is that that the CPE applies to a digestvaluex. And if that value is true, in other words, it's a representation of state of the attester. Then then the endorsement claim, which is, in this case, a CVE would apply to that adjuster. Another example for reference values, if the reference value claims match evidence, then the attester is valid."

And then an an evidence example, it's really you know, if the evidence was signed by the attester, then it's okay to accept it. So the this is simply saying that the verifier knows which a tester It's appraising. So it's a little more of a subtle condition, but you can kinda lump it in there if you like. So I see Mohammed on the queue. Hello? Do you hear me? Yep. Okay. So so by doing this matching condition, don't you think that you actually limiting it to be an equality or such kind of thing. I mean, it could be broader than that, it could be something that you do not want to match something that you might 1, 2, block or something that you want not to match. So what exactly is the reason behind doing this kind of limitation to matching condition. So I think in the case of reference values, it's not trying to to assert that they have the that that the that that's an exact match scenario. Reference value could describe a variety of of states. But they evidence should be, you know, within that superset of states. Otherwise, the matching condition is basically The it in as if if you have a set of claims that are not pertinent"

Regarding the endorsement example, beyond me not being a CV CVA enthusiasts. Are we asserting that as that the system under scope of test. By doesn't does not have a CVE? As the attester is claiming it. Am I understanding correctly? This is just a random example. The the idea is there are some the CV is one type of endorsement claim. There could be lots. And So it's just saying that the CDE up the c CV endorsement applies if There's a digest value for some software against which the CVE applies. Sure. And this is where freshness comes in because I presume you can only assert that you attest that it doesn't have that for certain certain, a certain snapshot in time and There's some other context as we know about whether you can trust that attestation or not.

I would like, you know, you to you know, praise me. And and the the verifier creates a context for the attester, typically, it's some kind of a connection. And then The record. And then and then the the evidence condition is a asserted by the attester that says, hey. I have evidence. And if you're talking to me, then accept my evidence. And so that's kinda the condition is just, hey. If it's me, you know, here's my evidence. So that gets us to record 1. Then there's another input, which in in this in in the next case, the next row down is the reference value condition, which is a reference value provider is asserting an input which is saying Hey. If this If the, record 1 exists in the accepted claims, then I want you to accept my reference values. And in this case, I show it as claims 1 in both cases because they're identical. And the only difference is who's asserting it And so in the case of record 2, reference value provider is asserting, you know, claims 1. And so, essentially, you have 2 records in in the accepted claims, which is claims 1 asserted by the attester, by testing environment 1, and claims 1 asserted by the reference value provider.

And so if, if the condition matches anything in in the prior set of records, then we assert record number 4 is added to the to the left to the left Mohammed, you have a question. Yeah. Just a clarification between claims because here, you write claims too and underneath, you write claims set 3. So is there any distinction between claims set and claims No. It's okay. Okay. That's fine. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about scalability. One of the concerns we have is how does this scale? So there's a the horned scalability clause basically describes, you know, different possible scalability property that you wanna watch out for. And in this case, we're limiting the set of clay you know, the set of records to be conjunction only. Which if we do that, it means we can get processing complexity is either linear or polynomial. And so if we assert that updates to the the accepted claims are appended Right. Because because of the position in the set doesn't really have any significance, then can then it's okay to just say, we're just gonna add to the end of the list."

In the case where a condition doesn't match, then you can try it again. Essentially put it back on the input queue. And process some other some other inputs and maybe with those other inputs, you'll be into you'll find a situation where the condition does match. And, of course, the verifier can stop accepting inputs as needed. So this is typically based on operational conditions, like you know, that maybe there's a an expectation for for when the verify needs to get back to the relying party. And so it's gonna put a limit on the amount of time that it can can devote to accepting new inputs. So here's some examples of what you might expect and just a little bit on the notation. I'm there's a pattern here, which is there's the the condition, the set of claims that are to be asserted in the authority. And and then that results in a new record that would be appended to the accepted claim set. So here's an example where we have a we have a digest as a as a we have in in evidence. We have a condition which is, hey. It's, you know, a tester number 1. It's me. And it's asserting you know, a digest claim, under its authority, key ID number 1. And, given given that the a tester is authenticated to the verifier, then We just accept those claims straight away. So to the right is the list of knows the first record."

This is asserting the claim that if the digest FED 4 is in in the accepted claims list, then it's asserted under the the key, under the authority of the reference value provider. Then assert a security version number as VN. In example number 2 or endorsement number 2, which is saying if the SVM is 7, and it's asserted under the authority of endorser number 1. Then assert that the version is 1.0. So you can sort of see how you know, we're just adding more claims as you go. Than building a richer view of of the attester. So what happens if more claims show up? So we could get more evidence, for example, in which case, that's fine. We just accept it. And but then the get more reference values as another condition. In this case, the scope is essentially all of the previous evidence and the new evidence. So you can see the search scope expanding to include all the evidence records. Now we're gonna talk about views or in a way an in other words, a way to restrict the The set of accepted claims that are visible. Or interesting.

So think of the think of the scenario where relying party makes a request. For a Natestation result. The view as part of that request. And that triggers and that you know, that is something that could trigger this processing of the view. If the verifier still process inputs on the view result. One thing to note here is the verifier processing inputs, if the if is and the view results differ that, you know, if if they make if it's if they're ver if they're recustor is making multiple requests and And the verifier is still processing input. While each of those requests are being made then. It's possible for the the results for the different requests to differ. So it's important to be able to to know when to for the verifier to to stop processing inputs. Inputs. And another kind of a note here is the ver the verifier itself could append its own claims.

It would just, presented and you're happy with them or not, or you can have the view concept and I think more complex setups. Think that's a that's a scalability thing. So I'm just wanting to point out that not every relying party must have an opinion about the view and a whole reds domain that's set up does not as necessarily have to support the concept, but it's really useful if you want to that he or PII or other, permanently setting up like, like, more more more aesthetic setups, I guess. That's very important for to hide out. I like to hear a passing by a cell phone might not have a weak fireman on this.

From The supply chain So for example, there are people creating s bombs out there. And they want their artifacts, and they are response to be trustworthy.

Presentation. There can be other claims added by the verifier and they come if the, at a station result, receiver, that's a relying part.

So what we add here as exemplary claims, for example, is an s bomb that is created by the attest So, there is obviously a build environment for something that has been built.

So this is one way to, chain these rats. And I think that's a good example because it now connects with other work outside. There is, for example, on GitHub, a relative easy remote signing service thing called 6 store. They have semantics. They're called in total stations. There were discussions about that on the list. We were thinking about how can we consolidate all this? So the blue boxes on top These have to be have, dials and and some levers to to to tell you what is what is going in there. And the predicates of in total and the trippers of Korim, kinda, the input that's is going from the top, And then you could also ask yourself, oh, the verifiers, the V's in these rats.

That is what we do because, when you have a really fast passing by relying party you can't wait on the whole rat to do the oppressive procedure. This can take a while. So what we do here in our ForeSee, we have, call it as up 0 trust.

So, so, I think I may be a very simple, suggestion is that which should we consider this diagram to, you know, for example, The the the the the layer 1 may include multiple, layer 0 entities, not not only one.

So all this chain here Could be the input to the first rat in the next chain. And the second dot in the we can basically nest this like it's 3 And that's the simplest nesting that that I can think of. And you can always already have diversions that as a different path that are hopefully acyclic in this chain. James And and if there are cycles, I don't know how to solve that.

Do you think this is a wrong approach. Because we wanna kinda compartmentize the things we wanna profile, so to speak. It's less The green one, are focusing on the blue ones. You wanna define what's in the blue boxes. And then maybe in a second step, find out when we profile that how does it affect configuration of the green boxes and we can't avoid that.

If any of you would like to join the design team, send me or hand us an email. The main focus of our design team has been getting the lamps draft CSR attestation to completion. Which is getting very, very close. And so the typical flow of the meetings is we spend 40 minutes looking at GitHub issues for the laps work and then 10 minutes actually working on the rats part. So it's been moving pretty slowly. But, we have made progress. Not tangible as in none of it has made it into a, an ID text update yet, but we still have, I think, made good progress on aligning the group goals. Yeah, so the meetup put a link to the meeting notes, which we take take careful notes after each meeting. So if you wanna catch up on what's been discussed, they're all there. Next, please. So I just wanna clarify. I was asked by some of the, the participants of the group to give a slight talk. We'll talk here explaining what the goals of this work is because I think it is a little bit different than what this working group typically deals with. So we're this this is a a design team composed mainly of HSM and by HSM, I mean a 19 inch rack mounted thing connected to the world by an ethernet cable. I'm not talking about chip soldered to motherboards. I'm not talking about USB devices. I'm talking about big HSMs. Next bus, And so the architecture of these devices and you know, there's there's several a half dozen or more vendors in the market that make these types of devices, and they all have different architectures. So this is a gross over generalization. But the architectures of these devices tend to be that the the the rack mounted appliance has some vendor firmware in it. Let's call it a crypto kernel. That owns all the cryptographic keys, Typically, all of these devices have some way to load 3rd party firmware onto"

And so you may have software locations that are making use of the keys on this TPM either directly to the vendor kernel or through a third party for Moore Colonel. Yeah. So this is, I think, a little bit different. And and so why we're having to do a totally new design project here I think is motivated by the fact is a different bit of a different problem. So the example here, I wanna illustrate to make this picture make sense. Imagine this HSM is part of a credit card manufacturing environment, and it's holding keys owned by a bank certified by viso or Mastercard, for printing cards. So then in that case, the 3rd party firmware running inside the HSM might come from the credit card manufacturer stack provider And so the 3rd party firmware might be, for example, hardening PKCS 11 to match car production standards. Or it might be encoding public keys and private keys that they can be loaded onto the chip and some financial services specific. Key format. So it might, you know, it modifying the base sort of P11 to do whatever sort of application specific thing is needed. Other thing that's sort of weird here is If you need to certify any of these keys, there's any keys in an HSM that need be certified. The CSRs for that would typically be constructed on the laptop, stent sent back into the HSM to be signed. So there's some sort of weird non trivial of where the data is created versus where the data is signed there's at least 3 sort of layers of boundaries that you might consider as environments you might need to create attestations for. So this is compasset device in a bit of a weird different way. Texas, So I think the rough design goal that team has been working through is sort of, confusionified by this Venn diagram in the"

    "text": "We've we've got a number of big HSM vendors participating and their devices all work quite differently, and their functionality sets are all quite different. And we're also trying to, at the same time, say, alright, you know, we got Talos and Udi Mako and in shield and IBM and crypto for a, and know, can can we can we define what is the intersection of functionality between those devices and then overlay on top of that TPM and can we find a reasonable middle ground or a superset of the middle ground that represents all that functionality. So PKS11, anything that's P11 is considered the common functionality. Obviously, there were keys in all of this. All of these things can describe whether they're in FIPs mode or not. And then there's things like we'll need some form of sub mods, submodules claim to describe any sort of third party non non non OEM software that's running inside the device. We pro we need a unique way to define the device, and I've put their OEM ID hardware model reversions, hardware serial, outside the TPM boundary because I understand TPMs actually don't want a unique identifier for the device. Is that right, Monty? For privacy reasons. Ends on the application. Yeah. So there may or may not be a hardware serial depending on the privacy signs of the thing. But for big HSMs, you know, I really do wanna say this firmware signing key is on on on HSM 4 in the data center in Switzerland. And super important that it's not in a data center in the US. And so I I actually do need to tell which physical hardware this key came from. So this is something that's very important for HSMs, but may actually be an antique goal for other types of secure processors. HSMs also need to build describe the backup and restore state of the key. So I could say tell me what this tell me how many times it's been backed up. Tell me if it's ever been restored. Tell me, you know, again, things that don't come up in a TPM world. So Next we're the the design goal of the team is basically can we describe what's in this intersection and can we come up with a standard evidence format"

So we've I I'm very sorry. That was that was explicitly stated at the beginning, all of the HSN vendors or ASN 1 shops they want to be ASN 1. This has gotta go to a certificate authority, which is an ASN 1 shop. We're doing this in ASN 1, not up for debate. Next place. No. It's not. So, things that we do have rough consensus on, and this is hot off the process of, like, our design team meeting last week. I'm not too sure all design team members will agree on this, but here's my view of what I think we have consensus on. We would like to define a list of claims, all of which are optional, including subject key. So we It may or may not be a key attestation. You may, for example, need to verify the running state of the through an attestation prior to actually generating any key material. So or you may wanna ask what the brine series said independently of material. So, so subject key has to be an optional claim. We have to support if you wanna think of it as platform attestation and key attestations, as separate objects or potentially nested. We want the format to be extensible so that we can add more claims later. Outside of the RFC and potentially even proprietary claims, vendor just start to start tacking on their own proprietary stuff, and that'll be handled gracefully. The general, protocol flow we want is that the caller, which is typically gonna be like a laptop or another server running outside the hardware boundary. Can construct the the the set of claims that it want filled in. So you can essentially construct an empty form, you know, the list of keys with empty values. And you pass that into the hardware, and it will collect the evidence"

As I said, like, all the key stuff needs to be optional. We're making good progress on the list of claims. We've got this running. In the meeting notes, we've got this running list of claims that's growing. I think we'll calling you to prune it down a bit. It's probably gotten a bit unwieldy, but we're, yeah, we're making progress at building out what we think is a base set of claims here. Things that we have non consensus on is should carrier format BNX 509 certificate, or should the carrier format be some new ASN1 structure. So the X509 idea is Good good good basically, when you request a key attestation, you use, you, then you produce a normal X 509 cert, when you're ask asking for a platform attestation, you produce an attribute cert and all of the claims go in v 3 extensions. It's it's straightforward. It's commonly done. We have good tooling for working with X509 there's good reasons to do it that way. The other half of the design team want define a new ASN 1 structure, which is basically a sequence of claim with a signature field at the end. And that the advocates, the proponents of that, are saying that it gives us more flexibility in how we design this. We're not stuck with all those sort of legacy vestigial organs of X 509. We could add multiple subject keys and multiple signature fields to ease PQ migration, you know, etcetera, etcetera. We can actually make it do what we want in a more flexible way. So this is this is, I think, the big thing that that we need to get the group consensus for the county write down a concrete proposal. So, Mike, you're gonna need to wrap up quickly. Sure.

We kind of, consume the results of the, rats outputs And, in order to achieve the routing security, And number 2 is that, we're from the name, and then we can see that's, it's a very similar concept.

So, basically, when we have the previous, routing, like 20 years ago, like we have a basic assumption is that the router is not trustworthy doing it the bestest can. So this does not predict a promise any kind of predictability of, forwarding behaviors. And, but then now things has changed a little bit.

From rats, then we can consume, like, using a dedicated packet that goes, you know, Trevor's the path and it consumes each individual, devices a test decision results, and then we can produce like a path level at history results.

But consider, like, the operator clients, they want to have some kind of a secure lease line. They are very, you know, security sensitive clients maybe they're from, financial institutions. They're from governments. They want their for any behaviors to be predictable. They want their forwarding only on top of trusted lines or trusted devices. And now the first step is to for the operators to know, like, what are the you know, trust levels or what are the trust conditions, security conditions of these devices. So the first step, we'll be having, like, a young model, or we can use some BGP LS methods to collect, to trustworthiness status, of the existing devices. And next step sorry, next slide. And then we can have this kind of dedicated packet that Traverse this, you know, this this path that maybe treated by using segment routing or, any kind of explicit routing or just, any color, regular triggers, no running.
