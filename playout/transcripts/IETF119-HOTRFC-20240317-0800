So the idea of, developing symmetric distribution system that only rely on symmetric retogger. So they don't make use of any form of asymmetric encryption. So let me give you a bit of, background and information that justify or support this effort. Asymmetric key, cryptography is a very versatile and powerful tool for distribution over the internet. However, it come with a few, shortcomings. First one is that it is generally computationally, a very intensive And the second is that the security of asymmetric Photography rely on mathematical assumption. The security rely on the difficulty of of solving certain mathematical problems. The arrival of quantum computer is now jeopardizing the security of asymmetric encryption because those machines are able to break most of the, most of the mathematic and mathematical, primitives, which are behind the symmetric ethnography. As a consequence of this, there are several government institutions, organization in in general, consumers of of cryptography, that are requesting, new standard for Symmetric exchange. So key exchange, which are only based on, on symmetric, cryptography. At, and, and the same time, system integrator and system architecture need to abstract from the symmetric distribution, system to avoid their system to depend on, on, on specific vendor. So we think that there is a need for, standard boarded, symmetric key distribution exchange level. So developing standard"

Next slide, please. So what we what we suggest here is to, develop framework and possibly standardizing some, protocol for, key distribution only using symmetric, symmetric cryptography. So we would like to have supporting the finding, system level API that allowed to decouple the symmetric key provider from symmetric key consumers and, guarantee interoperability between those systems. We would like also to provide, standard for, asymmetric exchange and the security within it.

Let's start it with the attack trends and problems, in there are 8,000,000 data attacks happened in the 1st half year of 2023. Which means that the tax happens more frequently. And, Also, it shows the future of hypervolumetric the largest, tax record in 2020 3 is about 2 million requests per second almost eight times larger than 2000 tons is recalled. So this kind of a high, this kind of a high volumetric cause the high defense costs to counter this kind of deduction attack, long term purchase, and the operation of large scale defense resources come at a very high cost. And also, the attack becomes more intelligent in 2023, more than half of the data set had use more than 2 vectors. And also, this is, example of the fossil flooding attack. This kind of cat can suddenly back to a high level for a shell duration, which is the hard to detect and also hard to defend. And also there are many new means of has attacks, such as some attacks, based on HTTP 2 or co op. So it's really hard to detect the new means were intelligent once for, also for our SP and for the enterprise. So there is a case if, first flooding attack is happening from the network from the operator to the enterprise"

So from the enterprise to the operator, which indicates the dot planned and to the server, we we think the, the enterprise should make, mitigation requires to the server and that the operator can acknowledge the attack and the develop mitigation strategies, and you then make the response so, that's very important. There are two key elements of defense. One of us is is visibility the other is defense results based on the visibility, which means the all the useful information about the defense scheduling strategy they can be the attack features, network telemetry, information word with us, writing intelligence. And based on this kind of information, they can do the schedule strategy and use the defense resources to do the mitigation. So we think collaborative mitigation can help expand both the visibility and the in, and increase the available defense resources. We have already, we have noticed does did us open threat signaling and, it has to defend, the protocol and the data mono collaborative mitigation during the transfers, but we found that there are also some shortcomings that's why we are doing the work with, the DDoS mitigation, club to mitigation.

So, here's the background. As we know, the emergency of the tragedy has marked the beginning of the rapid development's error for the AI and the generative AI, from a report by Yahoo, we can see that a chat achieved, like, 100,000,000 MAUs within 2 months faster than TikTok. And nowadays, the numerous LMs and, related effective applications has been proposed. And we have witnessed the LLM show the remarkable capabilities in concept understanding and also mathematical reasonings And this one is, solar as we recently released by the OpenAI. And from this application, we might say, the, the last younger model has a certain label of understand of a physical principle. So we are glad to see that the application of LMs in the networking field. Is receiving increasing attentions, So take the hot nets last year, For example, there are nice sessions in hotnet last year. And, 2 of them this focus on the flash memory model, one discussed can the reason about networking problems and if they're solution, or And another one, discussed can LMs manage networks.

Today, we want to bring a new a common proposal to IETF, which is about the threat surface management of the network element. So, let's see some background. Firstly, we all know that currently, the network, structure security is more and more fixing more more and more challenges right now. We can see that, in addition to the traditional way that the attacker can can attack us through the, the, the, the security devices and to hacking the customer's business system. To a lot of bad thing. 100, there are more and more attacker. They just, attack through the network network infrastructure. Through the router, through the switch, and IoT devices."

Or the, in internet outreach of the manufacturer's, production network outreach. All of all of these things is caught, many of them are caused by the networking structure security progress. So okay. So This is background. So, in this page, want to give a very quick overview of the, for example, take the IP network example, There are us a lot of threats to that network. We can categorize them into 4 for four four types type lines about the boundary. The boundary can be way be awaited and can be the invalid access. And so on. And, for our draft, for the network element, they can be, they can have some vulnerabilities and be attached to the external phase. And, they can and they can have the weak configuration and that they are low, well, the supply chain attacks and the more. And for the, controlling deadlines, rather, the looting protocol, problems, or the traffic interception, Right? And for the management, they can also be attacked.

Because there are in the architecture, there's 2 fundamental things that you can't verify. The insiders and the relational links. You just have to trust that those regional links are maintained properly and that the insiders I behaving properly. So we think we wondered, is there a blueprint? Is there a way to create a global globally verified information infrastructure like the web, but that would have 0 trust built in, and that would extend that internet scale. Turns out that there's a very interesting technology called confidential computing, trusted execution environment, that has been available for a few years now. And what it does give you is this fundamental property of being able to remotely verify the chip itself, the hardware, and then the software that runs on within the enclave within the trusted execution environment. And if you take this piece and you start leveraging it extensively, you end up with a blueprint that looks like this. Where you have entities, Alice and Bob, can be anything, people, organization, you know, digital things, physical things, instead of connecting to some enrollment server, identity server authentication server, they connect to one agent. Their own specialized agents, that software agent that runs in a TE. And that agent does enrollment identity authentication, authorization, all kinds of things. Then those agents to connect to other agents need to find a path or a secure verified path to be able to do automated key exchange and that is can be achieved with a chain of trustees, as we call them, which are other, you know, software actors that runs in these enclaves. Turns out, I have you've you create a the pattern or the the the blueprint the right way. You end up with a hierarchy call recursive. Pattern where the parents, parent trustee to multiple children"

And then you take these blueprints and you can start getting it out. By, you know, stretching your chains of trustees and you end up with a hierarchical structure that very much like the DNS but that is only, running across very side confidential computing machines. And then at the bottom, you can start deploying different agents for different types of entities And then you can stitch together these chains of custody where, you know, only the rightful entities, running all in confidential computing environments, actually exchange data with a fully automated change across the the trustee network. I need to rush a little bit. See you guys work. So this is the UNS and, UCA, anyway, when you take the diagram that you had before and you fold it onto itself, you that you end up with a network that has indeed no humans at all. No insider fully verified. So you have universal 0 trust across everything. This is a snapshot we built. So the update is that we built first version of this. We deployed it, and we are testing it right now. You end up with an information space that is fully encrypted with keys that no humans have access to at all. Only the, the verified machines have access to the keys. Interesting enough, it also saw for people who are in the identity space decentralized identity space, you can see that it collapses into a 3 party model. With actually full 0 trust interoperability, interoperability between any type of credentials that you would flow. That network. So site meeting tomorrow, p 6:7, if you guys are interested at 2 PM.

I'm Matt Juris from Meta, and I'm here to talk about adaptive video on the Internet today, how that intersects with traffic shaping. And how we might solve some of those problems with the ITS. So this is a really basic overview of how ABR video works today. So pretty much any video service that uses ABR. This is roughly works. So a user uploads a video, the video is broken down into individual segments of maybe a few seconds long, And the server will encode many versions of that video. Each one of those corresponds to a different quality or quality lane from maybe half a megabit per second to 20 megabits per second, and that often have a resolution associated with it. And then the clients of the video player will fetch these segments individually as the video goes on, try to measure the download speed, and then adapt, adapt, the bit rate, it's fetching based on its notion of how good the network is. So, it's probably not our surprise to anyone in this room, video makes up the majority of traffic on the internet these days because it's a very popular content. And so because of that, operators will, in reduce things like shapers into the network. They primarily do this to limit data because, you know, video makes up most of the traffic. And so to limit traffic, they have to limit video and conveniently because the these ABR mechanisms have a natural way to try to limit data by making the client limit it for them. So in this case, the operator introduces a token bucket filter of 2 megabits"

So it does this basically by know, arriving at the fact that there's a limit on the network. And so it stalls, and then eventually at the end there, gets a different quality level that's below the 2 megabit per second shaper. So this works, but It's kind of trying to achieve a second order outcome, which is data limitation based on a network thing and introducing a artificial limit. And so this has a lot of problems in practice. Not least of which the ABR schemes aren't but also congestion controllers aren't very good at dealing with these things. So a solution we think is really compelling, and there's really quite simple is If operator really wants to limit data based on limiting the quality. What if the the video player just limited the quality directly. So if it knows that on this network, that max that's going to be able to achieve is 2 megabits per second. What if it just ignores qualities higher than that. And so when it does that, what do you what happens? Well, It basically the same thing happens, etcetera. There's no stalling because it will never try to get a quality that's higher, the operator can remove that token bucket filter The network can be used more organically rather than hitting artificial limits. And this leads to overall better user experience and better performance. All this leads to, Skonebro. It's this is formally known as sad CDN, which presented at dispatch a couple ITF's ago. We've had side meetings since then and also some virtual side meetings. And, this idea, if we are having a bot, And so the basic idea of what's going pro, which has securely communicating network properties is to explicitly cooperate. So if you have content providers and you have networks and you have CSPs, that are all part of this. Why don't they just explicitly cooperate in a standard way And Encrypt that standard communication, and, for the purposes of achieving something like we saw in the last picture, which is that"

This sounds like something that's interesting to you, we have a BAF, a non working group me both on Thursday on session 1. And you can also find me or Marcus anywhere the hallway, or, reach out to us via email. Thank you. Yeah. So next speaker is a remote speaker. Adrian Grumper. Yeah. Oh, okay. Hi. The the topic for this has to do with the intersection, between large language models and personal data. Next slide, please. There are a number of, standards that relate to agency or delegated authorization, And, we're talking about these in the context of personal data as presented to, GPT 4 or a Gemini for Google, etcetera. Next slide, please. This is easy to under stand in the case of medicine. Where, the large language models have poofed already to be much better than doctors at answering questions because they so much medical knowledge that they combine in the public domain and they're so good at processing large amounts of input data. Gemini from Google allows a 1,000,000 tokens, for example, which is a larger than most people's health records even if they're ill. Next slide, please. So, what we're looking at is how to, what are the"

So, some people use the term prompt engineering for this. And, again, I won't go into the details, but There is, basically 2 possibilities. One of them is that the large language model will is able to access the data directly under its own control under its own authorization server. Or that an authorization server whose policies are run by the individual provides this data to the large language model. Possibly, with the prompt engineer in between to, add some fascation in some cases or synthetic data, etcetera. So, next slide, please. So, we're talking about building a standard on top of a, IETF stand that was just, approved in the last couple of days called Ganapp. Grant negotiation and authorization protocol. You'll see a link to it in the, slides at the end of the slides, and there's a there's a meeting on it on Wednesday. So, Ganapp does, not consider any particular use case such as, the one we're talking about here, of, authorizing access to personal data. For a large language model or building communities that would advise people on how to run and what policies to use, to control such access. Next slide, please.

There's a, pre work group, mail list, pdap@itf.org. Thank you. All those links are in the slides. Thank you. Okay. Our last speaker Nail, Yeah. You are right, Neil Crowett, and this is Vita. Yep. Hi. I'm Verified identity using distributed authentication. Next slide. Basically, we need a way to reliably attribute content to an author, This would allow us to answer questions like, is it authentic, was it altered, and who created this It should also address issues like false attribution and non repudiation Next slide. There are a few existing approaches for this problem space, However, they each have their own limitations. For example, most blockchain based solution cannot scale to extremely high volume. And C2PA's corporate driven solution is completely built on trust make it trivial to a generated forgeries. CTPA also requires registered X Five Nine assignment certificates. And this can cost 100 of dollars per year. Next slide. My proposed solution is based on dkim, which uses a public private key pair to authenticate emails. Frankly, I think the anti bam developers got it right."

Rather than signing email, it can sign pictures, videos, documents, or any other kind of media. The signature only needs to contain the host name for the DNS lookup optimal parameters for generating the signature and the small cryptographic, signature. Next slide. Because VITA is linked to the DNS record, It links attribution to a hostname. Authentication validation and non repudiation come from the use of public private key pairs. In addition, DNS provides a distributed environment and privacy through in direction. There's no dependency on a single vendor and the signer cannot track usage. Next slide. So what I need is some help. I need help ironing out the implementation details. Need help navigating the RFC submission process, and I'm used to writing really long essays, so I need help converting my novels into succinct into the succinct format that's used by RFCs. And while I am a programmer, I could use some help creating a wide range tools and libraries for other people to use. Last slide, Again, my name is Neil Crowitz. This is Vita. There's my contact information, and I thank you for your time. Okay. That's it. That concludes our session. And, again, thanks to all the speakers. And, thank you here. In dry.
