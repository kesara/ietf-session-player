So thanks. And and welcome from me as well. We wanted to remind you this is not above. This is the first meeting with the working group. So discussions here really need to be about advance the working group work. And and moving things along. Now there been some... Well, quite a lot of draft over the last couple of years related to this and we wanted to say that all drafts are welcome. Please post them in the data tracker and discuss them on the list. But be aware that the chairs aren't going to try to focus the working groups initial progress on the deliverables and milestones in the charter. That's still welcoming the other work, but we need to get those deliverables and milestones worked on before we've connect should get into things like solutions as a working group. So the milestones are actually really clear in the charter. There's only the three of them and there to adopt some drafts around problem statement use cases Gap analysis and that's gap analysis will be existing protocols and requirements.

And and the first thing we will need to build out of all that is a framework and architecture and that is our principal deliverable. I think we have a lot of time in those milestone dates. Looking at the work that's already in place, hoping that we can get some consensus I think we may over milestones quite well. That's alright. So the The charter talks about working on groundwork And and this is really to establish what we're trying to achieve. So the problem statement can be quite short but it leads to the use cases. And and I think we need quite a lot of description of the use cases in order to derive requirements. And the biggest set of requirements. He's going to be understanding what we mean by compute and what the metrics are. How do we describe compute in the network? Then there's some additional groundwork at this transcribed I'm kind of right having just discovered these metrics can we really sense use them and how do we distribute them And then that can open the door for us looking at the existing tools and protocols and understanding whether they're good enough or whether they have limitations"

It might be overloaded And also some services might have some, you know, specific requirement for hardware like Gpus, so it might not be suitable for processing. The next slide, please. So here, so I will show the problem statement in in more details. So we can see that in metro areas, when in weekdays there are lots of large amount of people working in metro areas, So there a large amount of U from in the left side and normally that a large amount of computing resources are deployed here to meet these requirements, but there might be some technology that these computing resource the computing service needs might be state to remote sight for some particular requirements and next slide, please.

So we we have shown three different cases for why that the traffic needs to be steered in different. So next slide, please. When considering about the traffic steering, So there are some facts factors need to be considered The apps some apps may require both low latency, they are latency scented, and some others may require some specific processing capability related to closely related to hardware capability For example, when you want the the camera on the streets, may need to recognize people, so they need some Gpu presenting capabilities so it need to be provided at the edge.

So we have shown three obvious cases to illustrate why the optimization joint optimization of network and computing needed. In the first case, when the network delay is about nine milliseconds because in this case, the Na may made there is a very con the congestion problem very serious. But you you can see that edge site may be very not that heavy, say around four milliseconds. So the total end to end delay is about twenty point four milliseconds. In the second case, the network is quite now it's not that heavy. It's spelled milliseconds, but the air side the second side is overloaded, right. So the total delay while be the two two twenty three point four milliseconds.

And also air size for to providing different kinds of capabilities for complex jobs. Right? So we have shown that we have... Found phenomenon that if you want to be safer, for example, it's a latency can be reduced by one hundred milliseconds the braking distant of a vehicle at eighty kilometers per hour can be reduced by two point two point two meters. So So for these latency sensitive and compute intensive applications some joint optimization network and computing need to be considered jointly. And some complex resource compact to see the making strategies need to be it need to be made together. By considering about the network and size capabilities. So next slide, please. So for quick submission about this problem statements and use case will find that the abs require and the requirements are quite different.

You know, that data center could have multiple days, multiple clusters so I don't have one number for the whole site. I might have different numbers depending on what you're hitting.

Thanks. Jim is demonstrating that he doesn't know how to use meta hydrogen. And and you can hear me. My mine's also a comment on the second use case on the S use case I I just wanted to throw this out there early because it's something that we actually struggle with a little bit in the S c working group, and that is that there's there's a third component here that you need to take into consideration when you're talking about the compute and that is Paula see. So for example, if you look at the firewalls, the firewalls are gonna have a set of policies that they're able to apply and you need to take that into consideration.

That's not what I have seen about. Has drawn here. Could use As as a transport for that. That's a different game. But the S problem what makes us interesting and hard is it's all about directing traffic to internal operator services that the operator is augmenting the user experience with. Placement of the decisions, the kind of decisions and the relationship to the underlying packet are very different. I think Google will find ourselves complicating our discussions and our work if we treat this as if it is part of the same problem. There is an interesting in task, directing traffic to service function instances firewalls walls, trans, all these other things, interesting in I hard direct to but it's a different problem in with different dynamics and different stickiness and I would recommend not converting the two use cases. Yeah. Thank you. And and the chairs had a look at these two use case documents and we sort of came to the conclusion that three different types of use case.

So I would urge the authors of these two documents and people without a use case scenarios to come together and see if they can sort out what's in scope and what's not in scope and and merge things into one then. I'm mean, the queue so. If you pull the queue before me, that's fine. No. Looks this queue is open and you are in it to speak. Okay. So about the use cases they are realistic realistic use cases and non unrealistic use case even in the previous period presentation, some of the use cases are highly unlikely. Because things will be decided much more locally than before before anything we're going to get distributed to asking for some additional input. For example, this breaking car scenario, will never happen in the real world. Breaking this decision will be done by the vehicle compute on the vehicle. They won't be looking for any assistance on that part. So I much rather focus on the real use cases that have some merit?

The first one is about per instance metrics dispersion. So in this style, we need to dispute the metric related to per instance. Right? And another one is about put site distribution. And which is recommended because in this solution. We don't need to handle those so many, you know, metrics because sometimes the the metrics would be updating very quickly. Right? So we will recommend you to follow this direction to discuss the solution and other things. Right? And in this per side's matcha distribution mode, And you see that we don't need the Cb id But actually, if you need to, like, specify which site it's associated with the service. That you may need the the the the c to associated with the site. Right? So it is a little bit detailed. Right and next, please. So we also update a draft before the cutoff say of this meeting. And in this updates, we make a lot of auditor editorial modification and we we did recognize the content of the drafts especially for section three dot. Three. Yep. So we add overlay cats, routers, and infrastructure in this section to emphasize that our framework is in, like, overlay framework work."

In section four, we had a subs section called provisioning subs but actually, we didn't add any, like, you know, text in index exception. So it it's it's quite new here. So welcome to propose your idea and to this section. Yep. Next. Yeah. We also update security consideration parts and we at two mainly two main consensus here, consideration here. The first one is about the metric update. We don't really like two free update of metrics Right? It's an engineer task that we we have to handle this So we propose some handling solutions such as aggregation, then something like this. And the second consideration is about the sensitive information leaking. And also we provide some possible solution to address this kind of yet. And welcome comments and into this section as well.

Could you please send an email or create a new open issue in github but that we can discuss this further because I think we definitely need, like, definition of what is compute, or computation resources that that's gonna very much to meet. You question that about the next steps. They also very a reasonable to, but really a question of which is probably better answered by the working group code.

Oh And I gotta a point Got a Yes. So you can implement it on the route. It can be deployed in the routers. It's be deployed independently. Right? Exactly. Okay. Okay. You much. And the other question is, could you please go to the next slide? About the identity. Dan fires. Yes. If I understand correctly, The service id is to identify a big service. Yeah. The binding is to identify a specific site. Service instance, which is located in different sites. Right? Yes. All the site. Okay. So the question is maybe I'm not aware of familiar with with the this workload group just why do name its binding idea? Rather than instance Id. Good good question. I cannot provide the answer right now, and we can have offline discussion about this. offline. Yeah. Is definitely note the final Okay. Okay. We can discuss version of this ten. Right?

It's challenging for a network device. Know to obtain the computing information. So the task need to be addressed in in cast work, is to I know we... We should handle two related issues. The first one to clarify what kind of company information should be defined and notified to the the same point. And also the other question Arises that by which means the computer computing information can be notified to the an point. And this drop is about the The first one, this first question, about the clarification of company the information. So next slide, please. And However, differentiate convenient capability is flagged in two aspects. The first one is in different sites, computing capabilities are wires And also the status these different service size are dynamic.

So a very straightforward way to you know, construct this validating system is run the real service test on the service side to observe the arp So for example, the throughput of the Ai image processing applications, like is it no that the deciding point in the network networks to know how many images per second that these competing size can provide. But however even for the same service, different clients may have different competing requirements. So in addition, some general capability test results cannot also be conceded to to generate the right final of score. So next slide, please. So paid three level computing evaluating system, and and it's not to say that service needs all the information in the evaluating system is suggested that service can choose what kind of information in cares to, you know, to make the decision And the the first level is quite basic is bound hardware hit to describe this company capability the indexes of this level maybe contain performance parameters like Cpu model, main frequency or Gpu model or floating point performance"

So on the compute modeling, there has been distributed something something. Group. I I don't know if there's stuff around, but back in ip f ninety eight, they came over and they presented a computer storage model that could you know, be viable for this and we're revisiting some of that work might be helpful because those are the people who really understand compute and they presented it model the work wasn't adopted back then by the community But now with this, there could be maybe some use for that.

If you can use a as egress router to connect the computing metric of each site And the the similar thing goes for the pencil. Either you can use a synchronize controller to calculated the person for for for all traffic on the character make it the depends to the ingress or you can use the ingress router it received the completely metric on the user calculated that cells.

Which I means is is connected buyer some kind of cloud monitor. It will conduct to the computing information of all size and then it will communicate to the network part For example, if you are using a centralized send the network controller will receive the metric from local call monitor and later the best has on this review to the calculated result.
