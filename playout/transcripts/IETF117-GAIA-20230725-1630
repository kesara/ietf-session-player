It kinda has to go the entire world only to come back to where it started. So next slide, So this is essentially the the the content locality problem And so this is from a a great paper written in 2018, nation state, hegemony, and Internet routing. Now I can read it at length example, over 50% of the top domains in Brazil and India hosted in the United States. about half of Kenyan Paths To the Top domains traversed the United States in Great Britain much of this phenomenon is due to trim Booning. where an Internet path starts and ends in the same country, a transit, an intermediate transit in Intermediate Country. Infrastructure alone is not enough ISPs and respective regions need better incentives. to interconnect to one another. to ensure this traffic stays local. Next slide. so this is kind of a a visualization of the core idea taken from a blog that And after a rope, after a rope, after a rope, after a rope, a couple years ago, essentially, if someone of a user wants to visit contents, odds are that contents that that that that request will leave. They content, or the region, travel somewhere else, and then we kinda bounce back to that user. And so this adds cost, this adds latency, implications, This has implications in just traffic in general. And this is this is"

And the goal of keeping content local is to stop it should be needing a traffic and to keep traffic as local or as regional as we can, keep it traveling and that are regional rather than unnecessarily traveling through international links. next slide. So the main idea here is that Trumboothing is a significant issue in the majority world. and we see this happening in America, we see this happening in Africa. see it's happening in in in countries. in regions where There isn't sufficient or robust infrastructure. and a host of different economic actors have taking their own cuts of how they want to deal and roll out infrastructure. Next slide. And so ISB's kind of promise there's this promise of peering as creating a flat instrument. So the goal to solve one way to solve this content problem is to create a physical location through which Internet Infrastructure Companies ISPs and CDNs, can connect to each other. These are called IXPs. And over the years, there's been a significant amount of work in boosting the speaker system on the continent. And so this graphic is taken from a report from from from from ISOC called anchoring and African Internet ecosystem lessons from Kenya and Nigeria's Internet change things. Wealth and they kind of lay out 3 stages of stages of IXP Development. ways of keeping traffic local, bringing international content in, and then in a building and strengthening the local ecosystem for content delivery. and provision And and the idea behind IXPs is that sort of rather than using transit, which was in a bilateral interconnection where a customer pays a provider for connectivity to global Internet. Peering is kind of an arrangement between 2 networks where they bypass that transit provider"

And peering obviously involves a number of traffic and and independent costs, These are fees, maintenance expenses, and etcetera. and then have traffic dependent costs which are kind of larger ports for higher traffic rates, which tend to be more expensive depending on the ISP And so for a majority of networks peering is tends to be the better option. research is showing that particularly in Africa, a lot of local ISPs don't necessarily see the benefits of tiering. but the big move in Africa has been to support and then to encourage IT speed growth to encourage a flatter Internet where there aren't too many intermediaries between links next slide. And so Internet flattening refers to kind of reduction again in the number of intermediary organizations on the Internet's path. So the idea is that with more peering, we get a flatter Internet. And this is this has been the kind of folk theorem of IX growth, and Ixp Development, and Ixp expansion. Next slide. you might be well, Or someone might ask, way, but is this the correct measure of flattening? It's got a strong layer bree smell. and everyone else responds. Well, don't really worry about it. We don't have to worry about it. links or physical and locals, there's nothing to worry about. later three smells aren't that bad. Next slide.

So they might want to use So everyone's got a reason. to support the growth of a flatter Internet. or the flattening of the Internet and support my ISP growth. Next slide. so what we And seen the data over the years is there's a significant number of IXPs found in Africa since the early since the mid nineties, particularly in between 2011, 2015, and then on into 2020 today, we see kind of a large relative UI Expedia that are being founded on the content. Next slide. And particularly, if we look at the kind of the IX fees. If we look at the number connected networks for existing ISPs. We can see at the very, very end, that circle, I wonder if you can read it, but not Africa. It's an IXP. has the largest number of connected networks, Now I only highlight this because it's important to the general story. I'm about tell. But in general, ISP promote. make it cheaper to interconnect more networks obviously has the benefits that I described above. So next slide. So the takeaway is, period, and IXPs can keep track local, and we know this, and it keeps the Internet flatter. Next slide. Alright. So now that we have appearing it. I excuse me. We know that it's going to take the Internet flatter. We can also add caches and pops at these IXPs. And that can definitely keep international transit local.

It it's it's a it's a fairly complicated decision for a content provider to decide whether or not they want bit of cash or pop. Next slide, And so in IXP, goes to a kind of provider and asks, can we get a cash? kind of provider does some kind of calculation, next slide. And, usually, the answer they get back Usually from Google is no. next time. And so there have been initiative like, the open CDN concept run by a couple of Brazilian IXPs as a way to kind of fix or circumvent this issue. an open CDN is a shared infrastructure initiative And it helps CDNs reach Brazil and Internet users with low delay. And, essentially, as a way of grabbing smaller ISPs to make it look like they're a lot. They're a larger eyeballs in a particular network, and this can then attract CDN to an IX, versus each individual ISP going to the CDN and asking for a cache. Next slide, But as we know, cash flow is too damn high. Right? And from what I've heard in the kind of whisper network, no one's necessarily having no one's found a fix to high cash flow. And this is kind of an RFP put out from, you know, a society years back, trying to find kind of ways of covering cash flow for a verisbee's connected item I have an IX, Next slide. And so"

One being that more CDNs are actually going into creating their own off So it's kind of leaving IXs and going deeper into customer going closer to the customers into ISP networks, And they're having recent proposals to share a cash infrastructure like the open CDN work However, when these caches are behind, it can go to peer's network, There's what we call an instability that we believe requires incentive aligned. And we call these cash games. And so in our work, we can identify 2 types of cash games. Next slide, So the first is the inter ISP cash sharing. games is when you have a number via speeds connected at a either an at an IX, And one ISP has a Google global patch, and they might decide to advertise the routes to this cache, to the other ISPs on that IX fabric. and This can work to a certain extent if the ISP doesn't have significant limitations or concerns about of that link. Maybe they don't have a lot of eyeballs. on their network, they might not worry about the trade offs in letting other ISPs use those routes. But where when For example, if ISP 4 gains 200 new customers and all of a sudden, That link becomes really important, and that trade off becomes a little bit more expensive. it's potentially the case where they could cut off access to that cache to other ISPs. or take negotiate treaty outrageous prices for all the other ISPs to use those routes. And so there's kind of an instability here when it comes to cooperatively adsharing in this in this setup. next slide. other that we've seen in the wild is inter The class sharing where you have a number of IXs or cooperative community IXs, that interconnect somehow on another IX"

And so the idea here, isn't it? is it possible to only have 1ix pay for that cash flow and then have the other IX update their cash through that other IX that pays for the cash flow. And so there have been we've seen in the wild instances in which Iectas have made from the handshake agreements where they've allowed if shared each other's cache updates and use 1 1 global cash to update the global cash. But even here too, they're still in the sense of alignment problem. Right? These are usually just friendship agreements. from the agreements. And so when those trade offs become more costly. It's unsure. what happens. Next slide. So the takeaway here is coordination and cooperation is still difficult even in the presence of IX. IXPs. And the content problem is also deeply relational. and a lot of the work that happens out to circumvent these problems or can't be repeated at that scale. Next slide? So beyond just the capturing problem, there's the reality of peering and peering arrangements. And so in reality, what we see and what's been a practice We didn't realize this until talking to a lot of IXs, is that remote hearing, which is a different Puring behavior. There's direct peering in which There's an expectation that the other peer is physically located at the same facility. connected to that interface But what we see more so now is a lot of remote peering in which That peer is not necessarily in the same facility, either uses some layer 2 provider to access the IX or uses reseller that has facilities that has presence, physical presence in that facility to then"

And this has been something that's been in practice for years in the I have seen the peering space as Ray is very is a very contentious network Engineering, approach, but it's very, very common. And believe it's one of the main things that's been driving Ixp Growth, particularly Ixp Growth, on the continent. next side. so this is a paper that was looking on at the latency impacts of remote hearing. And and the only African IXP that they have on this list is Snap Africa, the one I pointed out to earlier that had the largest number of connections And the thing to highlight in this graph is they were comparing latency between remote carriers, with between remote peering and between a transit provider. And by and large, and the number is fairly significant. for in Nap Africa where 98.1 with point one connect 98.1% of the of the routes of the remote routes had lower latency. than transit. And so this is huge, obviously, because one, trends that may be expensive so you might choose to use in IETs. But but Your traffic is also just also has better latency if you choose to use a remote pure and that remote pier might not be one hop away. in reality. might be multiple hops away. but has lower latency. And so the idea behind content locality and keeping traffic local might be at the might happen at the cost of or it might there might be a trade off between traffic local. and using a roll up remote here.

The paper also goes and looks at the the difference between local and remote and local and transit links don't do that for African IXPs because there's just a significant lack of data. to do some of those comparisons. But this comparison enough between remote insurance, it is pretty stark. Next slide. And so these are just a couple screenshots of evidence of not having used this strategy for a long time. And so and again, we think significantly on the growth in in in ISP, or some of the the reasons why Networks choose to use ISVs is because of remote hearing. Next slide. AULTitations from the report on another report I'm moving towards an interconnect Africa. We can see that the cost the annual for a 10 gigabit ports, ports, is, like, 0 for now. for for Nap Africa. And so again, there's huge benefits to using remote peering. But the question is, like, what impact does this have an actual content, lowcasualty Next slide. So a couple things to think of. 1 is the BTP OPAP to local. So there are there's not really anything we can do in VDP to distinguish between a direct peer or remote peer. And even then, there's a lot that we don't know And one of the main things is we don't know necessarily the latency differences between appear that was connected directly and access to content through a remote here. And we just don't have the data, there isn't research on that data. That's one thing that our lab is working on. try to understand What are the latency differences between local and remote peering? So what does this mean next slide?"

It means that what we need better vantage points. A lot of the reports that have done research, particularly the one I pointed It's just a lack of vantage points in Africa to use these measurements. And Given what we said, we need these these bank accounts also need to get us information on gearing arrangements, because those are important because we might infer something incorrect because you might presume that appears connected locally. rather rather the peer might be 1000 and 1000 of miles away. And we don't again, we don't know what this means for local the level of content traffic happening in local CDNs and global CDNs. And then forces us to refine what we mean by keeping traffic keeping content local. is latency and cost enough or is there something should we separate the need for supporting local to create a locally in Africa. and making that content available and accessible on the content versus the ideas behind keeping our traffic vehicle. Next slide. So the takeaway here is that we just can't fix what we can't measure. Next slide. And so to end off there's a a really great book with my second analogy. Flatland, a romance of many dimensions, and the book essentially just kind of talks through the problem of perspective. And A point can only see a point, a line can only see a line, and point a sphere can see squares and everything underneath but nothing higher. Next slide. And so the idea here is our problem is that a lot of our research we've been carrying out has been a view from flatline. links that have been dynamic remote not necessarily physically local. We've viewed and we've interpreted"

So I'll end with this final quote. taken from Flatland, flatland, Without pow without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows, only hard in with Luminess edges, and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and And so if we really want to fix the Internet problem with traffic, the content locality problem in Africa, so we need better test beds, we need better vantage points we also need to know what we're measuring and what's going on. And there's very few work out there shining a light on what's actually going on in in and and gearing and connectivity and the as it as it regards to peering links and their impacts on latency.

There's one slide I added in Yeah. Steve Stong recently just did a global CDN map We're sort of mapping out all of the different infrastructure bits on on the And so that kinda raises the other point, which is in that Google slide, I put up. I didn't have enough time to go through a lot of the the decks. So one of it is the calculations that they do on whether or not to bring a cache in. is where the incumbents, how many eyeballs do they have, how much power and control. Does it make sense to both put a cache in the incumbent and a cast in smaller operators. But the business model, I think, is a huge plays a huge role. We don't have answers. We just have questions, and we think that's one of the dimensions that influences how these topologies these actual topologies in terms of remote peers exist. And we start to look at the big IXs, like links and D Six and or even map Africa. I think a lot of that is a function of their market power, And then a smaller IS is IS ISP is just kind of play along with that. And so there's there's there's a lot in this that we can't really unfurl. But I think having infrastructure that we can use to measure and understand this versus using peering DV, which has very limited information that we can use understand the nature, the dynamic nature of these things. But, you know, I agree. I think that is a dimension but I'm a junior researcher. And but I think any insight that you have into things at my influence how we look at this. So we stick our output.

For example, mandating as part of the ISP license. the need to interconnect at IXP. It's it's now reaching a point where the government says if you want to be an ISP, you are required no longer recommended, but you are required to interconnect atixplocations. and they're actually you know, building out, over 20 IXP locations under the of the public national Internet Exchange of India, Nixie, infrastructure. And I I totally get the point that other people also made that some of the incumbents are just pretty much showing the middle finger to this requirement by saying 1 of the largest mobile network in the country, peers at the Nixie peering point on a 1 GBPS score. And and this is a mobile, operator with over 200000000 subscribers. Right.

And typically, from a sort of Nedentrality or sort of open Internet perspective, those can be rather troubling. They're often done because because local governments want jurisdictional control over data. Either maybe censorship or other things. So But I but I do think that there is then this benefit where you get a flatter Internet. So I'm sort of compelled by you know, maybe there's a side benefit here, but maybe it would be more useful to think proactively about how to incentivize then. Local traffic sort of goes to what I think next come on the queue to talk about, which is you know, why aren't bigger content providers localizing their traffic more what are the barriers to that, and how do you incentivize that happening because it's more sustainable.

What what what would you say is the largest disincentive. out of out of 1st level, it would be the amount of traffic. because, usually, they'll come in and they'll commit to a certain port size, And so it's whether or not the traffic that they're seeing on those ports. So it they they're looking at cash efficiency. And so if we're going to spend like, infrastructure time to build out and to maintain discussed. We wanna make sure that it's being used effectively. I think the cache isn't being used at all, there's no incentive for us to come there. And one way to increased cash efficiencies to have a significant number eyeballs on that network. And so, actually, Cesong, I I mentioned earlier, just come up with this infrastructure map. And if you see it, you see, like, Facebook probably has the most amount in terms of edge infrastructure for their content. on the continent. And the majority of this is because it's easy to optimized for efficiency for Facebook's content versus others. So I think at a very first level, it would be eyeballs and efficiency of their caches. And then once you then there's a whole bunch of other reasons. And One thing I'll add to is you might have a network that might have significant amount of traffic but actually network engineering decisions on the level of their transit provider might make it look like that that traffic is"

I'm student, UC Berkeley at the Vice By Professor, Scott Shankar and Professor Sivaramanasumi. and really excited to be here to share this initiative to join part of this initiative to bring Global Internet access, everybody. And for our group, we have been working on innovating on cellular architecture, for some for courses that will strongly be living. and to doubt we didn't want this effort which is demobilizing cellular access with cell widths. And this work was published in the Silicon Conference And then one thing I would like to project in advance that I have the animation in the slides I'm not sure what it's gonna show on that on the deck. I think I have to rely on my sound check much more where I do it. So if you got confused, most likely to go to is missing animations. Next slide, please. Yeah. We started this work with a simple growing mind, which is grow the attending seller. Serial Network is getting more and more important nowadays. globally speaking over over 5 minute subscriber contributing to over 60% of Internet traffic. However, despite the growing importance, today's cellular ecosystem is still dominated very small number of large mobile network operators and then most."

Therefore, the goal of this work is to try to bring competition the cell ecosystem and load the barrier to entry for new entrance. We like players other than the major carriers who joined the market and profit from providing cellular accesses. And we realize that the key to enable this vision is to ensure that operator with small to medium scale footprints. can compete equally within the ecosystem. by small to medium scale footprints, mean, operator covering a city. a village, a plaza, or even down to a single cell tower. by competing equally We mean that the users have no reason to discriminate between 2 operator based on the scale of the deployment. Instead, we would like you to consume seller access in a way for with any available with any excess provider that's available at the location in town without worrying about whether the provider has coverage in other locations. With this going might, examined today's data architecture and realized that This is fundamentally at odds. with this vision of empowering small scale access providers. And in the next few slides, I will tell you other reasons. And to before we get started, I would like to clarify some acronyms that we use in today's talk. MMO, as I mentioned earlier, stands for mobile name operator now sometimes use operator or access provider for it. NVMO stands for mobile virtual network operators like Google Five, sometimes it was a word virtual operator for it. and UE stand for unit equipments. and now we use the term user to refer to either the user or the user equipment depending on the context. and next slide, please. So there's missing in animation, but Here, this example of illustrating how today's users uses use several services Here, we show 2 operator. Both of them have large deployments. For you to obtain several service, the first thing we need to do is to sign up with some of the operator and establish a contractual relationship. And this contractual relationship and trusted relationship will then allow the operator to perform a set of user management functions such as AAA, authentication, authorization, and accounting"

    "text": "And then after having this contract with the operator, the user can now attach the network with the authentication function implemented at a management plan of the operator. And the user is then assigned with the IP address and can go into go to Internet. And later, when you then move to a different location within the coverage of the operator, the operator, the network is responsible for migrating user from one tower to another via handover. And such a handover is really done with network coordination between cell tower as well as cellular core essentially make sure that users IP address remain unchanged and the user's connection can be maintained. And this is usually referred to as a seamless mobility experience that Celine will provide And lastly, when the user move toward move further away and out of the coverage is is of its operator, assuming that these operator have a room in contract with a VLTP operator, user can run into the other operators' network. And roaming essentially allowed an operator to kinda expand its coverage potential downside is the user is usually assigned with a different IP address. because it's hard to maintain the same IP address across carrier boundary. And this changing IP address can lead to service disruption. because for traditional transport protocols at TCP, IP address is the unique identifier of the connection. However, this is not a big issue today because most of the carriers have large footprints. for, roaming happened pretty rarely. user mostly enjoys seamless mobility experience. We'll move from next slide. And for its virtual network operator, virtual operator, although they introduce a new business model, it doesn't really change the underlying cell architecture. The only difference here is that instead of the user signing out with the operator, you sign out with the virtual operator. and the virtual operator then contract with multiple operators and offload most of the cellular operations. including the in network mobility support. And here, I would like to point out 2 key properties of today's cell architecture. First, in order to achieve broad coverage, they rely on police leverage trust. This means that user can only use this network that they have contracts with. either directly,"

Either way, a pre established trust need to happen. And second, in order to support seamless mobility, today's architecture relies heavily on in network coding And, unfortunately, neither of while these two property serve pretty well for operators with large footprints. neither of them supports small scale access provider. Missus an ex wife? To see this, let's Let's see this example where we all will happen when we have a large number of smaller provider. In this case, we show 4 of them. And let's see whether we can use first first, let's see what what we can use is this method to achieve broad coverage. here, if we follow the convention, have the user sign up with owner operator? because the operator itself have very small footprint. In order to provide user with satisfactory coverage, then have to contract without all the other small scale access providers. And this incur high transaction cost of manually establishing all this agreement and it's clearly not scalable. Next slide. And virtual operator doesn't really change this. The the only difference is that instead of operators establishing pairwise roaming agreements virtual operator now need to go ahead and establish all the agreements with the order agreement with small scale access providers in order to provide good coverage. and still incur transaction costs. and it's not scalable. and Next slide. Okay. So so So the existing master doesn't allow us to support brokaw reach for small scale access provider. and they do not support seamless mobility either. The reason is because when you have a large number of small small scale access provider. users moving users frequently close the boundaries of different carriers. And as mentioned earlier, this will incur frequent IP changes and therefore lead to frequent service disruptions. So you won't be able to easily have similar code mobility unless you assume some sort of type in our coordination between all the operators."

Next slide. Relating all this issue of the drawbacks of today's architect we propose a new set architecture named Sellbrich. which ends which we try to make sure that we can scale to a large number of small scale access providers. And in here, next, I will briefly talk about how we can arrive at a self designed step by step. First thing, first thing we first the first thing we're the first design decision that we make in self works to start from IBM Architecture. Basically, we believe that decoupling service provider from access provider is a great idea. because it makes sure that the user is no longer bound to any small scale providers. Because of this, we introduce broker, which is a similar entity to to to NVMO, with different functions. And the operators in our architecture is called Btelcos, this because it will become clear that they actually serve very fondant different functions compared with operators today. And the then starting from NVM NVMO based architecture. their tool support we depart from it, support growth coverage and seamless mobility. 1st, support growth coverage instead of having a brokered establish contractual relationship with all the small scale access provider, we embrace an on demand and untrusted relationship between By own untrusted, it would mean that the broker does not need to have any contract with the beta post beforehand. And by only man, it means that the broker only interact with a BTelco and establish a relationship a user requests to attach to it. So it's only meant and untrusted. And what we realized is that in order to support this on on demand and untrusted relationship between broker and beta code. we need to have architectural changes. Because now that the btelcos or aka the operators are untrusted, can no longer count on them for for user management tasks such as authentication and accounting."

And by doing so, we basically have the program that we're performing authentic authenticate functions and authentication and accounting, and then and then by doing it, and then we'll be able to support use all the small scale access providers in the on demand and untrusted fashion. this is the first part of the design, which is to move the user management out out of the network And the second part is about the mobility parts. As I mentioned earlier, we have small large number of small access providers. moving user frequency cost boundary of them and you incur high a large number of IP IP changes, which is hard really hard to address within the network. So all they decide to do is to embrace IP changes. and essentially expose IP changes and let the end host handle IP changes. Next slide. basically, we moved we also moved mobility support out of the network into end host. So instead of relying on the network, to hide the IPI changes, rely on end hosts to explicitly handle IP changes protocols, for example, like MPTCP and Quick. are capable of maintaining connections. during IP changes and try to ensure that we by try to provide seamless mobility, even though we have no coordination between retail codes. and try to Yes.

This is a this is basically a subway's architecture at a high level, And to recap, the goal of the cell based architecture is in enable own demand seller access from any available access providers. by not requiring any priests, every trust, with speed telcos and not requiring any in network coordination between the be telcos.

The first question are usually people ask about spectrum. There are three points we like to make about cell about spectrum for self First, first, supports are require no changes to the red.

You know, there's CBIS, which is a dynamic spectrum sharing scheme, they allow you to use spectrum without having exclusive license to it. and also some regulatory constructs that allows you to operate in some license by unused special spectra.

Selwicks is essentially a radically different set architecture with the main goal of lower the barrier entry for new operators.

But I wanted to contrast your technology driven approach lowering those barriers, to approaches that are currently being taken by some countries. The example that I like to use is Malaysia because I've seen a little bit of how they are trying to do it where they're basically saying, hey. if these are the challenges getting efficient and widespread access networks is a probably the biggest cost for a new operator coming in, they are basically mandating that the entire 5gspectrum will be owned by a single entity who will operate a common access network and that entity will not operate as a carrier or provide end user services. So they will purely be a service provider, and pretty much every carrier in the country then becomes an MVNO that runs on top of this common infrastructure. But that whoever is managing and administering that common infrastructure. does not compete with the MVNO. So Every carrier can then only compete on this, their own product.

So the description that you're describing about providing a marginal access advantage, sort of works, in the default assumption case where you don't have any large spikes between peak usage, other types of things.

The fact that you can use any operator near you because there may be when there's a peak, it's likely that 1 of the operator is is overwhelmed while the other one has some leftover capacity, like, really transiently happens.

Is it better now? because they're happening now. Okay. So my question is, are you envisioning an architecture in which the IP address of the mobile node is changing routinely. Did I get that correctly? Yeah. Of course. We are we are in we are in modular we imagined that at least when you close the barrier, within the within each beta you can do in network mobility. So maintenance IP address doesn't -- Okay. -- the same they do. But when you cross the barrier, we imagine that across the boundary, we imagine the the IP address will change. They may not -- Okay. So what that means so what that means is that, essentially, you're moving the cost of mobility from the lower layers to the application. So every single application needs to deal with the issues of mobility. And so there are certainly our technique us allow you to do that. The best thing is probably multi path TCP. has been recently promoted by Apple, which is originally from from Brussels, from Belgium.

And we measure, like, application performance when you when we try to what we try to do is that we change IP every single cell tower. And it turned out surprisingly that the performance overhead is really not big. And the reason was that a lot of this mobile application, they already built with this assumption in mind that, okay, wireless mobile network is not the so the good bandwidth is not stable. So they have large offers, and they have taken a lot of action to handle this kind of abrupt changes in terms of the throughput that they can achieve or things like that. So as long as you can mat kinda like mask the API changes. and quickly ramp up your your throughput or your throughput. performance over here is really, really very small. So this so I think one thing that we try to argue here was that Maybe it's tough. Just like, maybe it's time to just, like, not do all the heavy lifting within the network, and it's just exploded and let the higher level handle it.

Something that I've been talking about a lot of places. which is, you know, broadly what we're calling computing within limits is something that we've sort of build it up a community of researchers over the last 8 or so years. And let me see if I have control over the slides or no idea. You can just ask me, and I'll forward them. Okay. Yeah. Let's go to the next slide. So I've been working on the topics that are related to Gaia for you know, about 10 years or so Internet connectivity and networking for long before that. But simultaneously, you've been concerned about broader questions societally and ecologically about where we're headed, what can be done, what should be done, and think these are probably my old slides. So the The real question that I've been asking myself as a networking person is maybe a reframing of this is really that networks are how we organize our societies. And so it's not just a matter of connecting to the Internet broadly"

We don't want 0 rated walled gardens. We want something more expansive as the the network to which we are connecting people. But I want to think even beyond that to think about global challenges that we face you know, largely in the computing within limits community, it's been about energy and resource and logical challenges. And then I wanna step back and think, What are the unique skills that we bring to the table as networking people, as systems people? that especially the Gaia community and the ICT for community, have that perhaps the broader networking community does not have an awareness of or a focus on So next slide, please. And so let's talk about limits next slide. So, you know, when when I started this journey for myself, you know, something around 2008, 2009 sort of thinking about what's the role of computing within limits and limits being all of these different types of energy and ecological limits, the natural place to start was always do we use energy and what are the consequences? Next slide. And you know, the first thing that everybody focuses on when we talk about computing is, well, we use a lot of electricity, So let's try to make things more efficient. But it's long been known in Eklog economics that efficiency doesn't always work. Right? If there's, you know, what they call rebound effects been a phenomena that's been demonstrated over and over again. and we, unfortunately, in computing have been demonstrating this, which is that by making things more efficient, frequently, especially when the economics are aligned in certain ways you end up with"

Well, what do we what's the role of computing computing folks who are interested in these kinds of problems. Next slide. And so the next challenge that of course people turn to, and, you know, I spent some time thinking about and looking into is, you know, what are the questions around climate change that computing folks should be aware of and thinking about as we do our research Next slide. And this slide I'm sad to say I made in 2008. and I was preparing for this I thought, oh, should I update it? And I thought, No. There's no need to. it's exactly the same. except where we are in the slowly boiling frog situation has changed a little bit, you know, there was less urgency and less worry about it when I presented it to students and researchers in 2008, then there is now, but still, not all of us are really working on Questions related to the future of the planet. Next slide, please. And know, there's lots of research going back again quite a ways you that the the the way that business as usual is operating is not going to cut it in terms of actually avoiding what what you know, climate scientists are generally calling quote unquote dangerous or catastrophic climate change.

We can try to help use fewer resources, less resources. Now in the Gaia community, There's and the ICTD community, there's this interesting dynamic, which is that the focus is largely on the global population that is already using very little or is using less than those in in the wealthier parts of the world. So is it really the right choice to say, well, it's we need to have those users. Those folks use less. But the flipside is that we actually have a better understanding of what it's like to build systems and build if networks are how we organize our societies, build societies that can use less and still have good lives. And then, of course, changing sources and finding more is not really something that you us as computer scientists are gonna really solve the problem there. Next slide, please. And so, you know, often when I talk to technically minded folks. They say, well, we've got lots of alternatives. We can find other energy sources will power our computing some other way. And this is from Tom Murphy's excellent book. on the topic, he considers, you know, what are all the different alternatives, And next slide, please.

And so, you know, returning to these questions of where we head can be done and what should be done. I kind of I and this is really more of a personal story.

Next slide. And so, you know, I often thought about the the The split between sustainable computing versus computing sustainability. Right? So we think about, okay. we want to construct sustainable societies of which networks are one part, but networks are enablers of broader changes in society that will be for sustainable societies, It's not that we We we do want the networks that we build to be sustainable. We want them to be efficient. We want them to be as low waste and sort of fit into a circular economy. but networks are just very small piece in terms of the energy footprint, the material print, but they connect so much more. Right? They enable resource flows. And if we one of the things I often think about is know, in some of the early rural Internet access work I did, you know, something like 10 years ago now.

And so the network changed other networks. Right? It changed the the the Internet connectivity, of course, changes the economic networks. It changes the social sit networks, not the online social network, but the actual on the ground, the social network of a community. And so We shape so much more through the connectivity, that we have. And so back to this idea that networks are how we organize our societies, Computing for sustainability and networking for sustainability can be about How does networking shape the creation and organization of a sustainable society. Next slide. And so, really, what I concluded is that I wanna weight my work 95% in the the latter bucket and for sort of 5% in the former bucket of the work that I do of this type. that really, I wanna think to you know, how am I helping create a sustainable society through the networking and systems to the table.

And, look, we found a way to spray fewer decides on the crops. is not good. navy. Maybe. but it also reinforces a system that is unsustainable. Instead, if we take a systems perspective, we can think of.

But before that, I would just like myself to go back to 20 years when I was working for the Pakistan telecommunication authority as a regulator And remember, it was same time in 2000 3 when we were very excited to know that. we are going to deregulate our market in Pakistan So we can break the monopolies of incumbent and people are not relying only on copper, but rather the new mobile 2g, 2.5g, networks are coming in and will open the market for the players. So we can provide Internet access, mobile Internet access to people. and then we can, you know, meet the dream of connectivity. Unfortunately, 20 years After that, I'm talking to you about this presentation where still half of the world population is not connected. Although There have been a lot of improvements beyond that. But what has been the basic reason what why we have not been able to connect even in Pakistan, the whole population in 20 years of this mobile Internet revolution and some of the reason that I believe are connected with the the commercial nature of Internet service vitches, connected with the investments of the mobile operators or the telecommunication operators. 1 to require a license.

So then they have to again invest into that user base which lives in cities or towns where they get this ARPO ARPU. As remember, we used to call it the average revenue per user. So eventually, in the nutshell, thing comes back to how much money a user is able to give back to a mobile operator. and and that to me still remains the reason why we see half of the world population not connected mostly of those living in rural and remote places and villages where perhaps, a telecommunication operator is not interested to invest because there is no ROI. some of the world that we do in terms of bridging that connectivity gap is through small networks, which are built by for and with the communities around the world. And one of these network that I've built recently is in the mountains of Himalayas near the Mount Avist where this community known as share pass are the people who have himalius as their home for 100 years back from Tibet, they migrated into into Himalias.

One is the the source of income is is completely dependent on tourism. People who come either want to go to the mount of a space camp or, want to do a summit. They need a shared per guide or a shared per person to help them. So that is their key income activity. However, there are a lot of villages including the which are not part of the mount Everest track. the main track.

However, there was no Internet. The Sherpa girls and boys studying in that school do have Internet as a subject, but, again, to me, it was a big surprise that They don't have Internet access. They're just reading Internet out of their books and they don't have opportunities to actually experience what Internet is.

Rather, they're going back to Kathmandu to find some job opportunities or even some of them leaving Nepal altogether. because they don't have enough opportunities which at least could be filled up through decent and stronger Internet connectivity. So we decided to deploy a fiber optic network for these Sherpa people. So each of them can have a decent Internet connectivity in their homes and the youth and the woman and the older share pop people can start experiencing digital transformation, where their dependency on people sitting in mandu could be reduced. So we estimated a 100,000 US dollar funding needs. We went out. asking for some donors to help us to connect these 2 villages with the fiber optic connectivity We did receive some funding.

We have more than 30 years of experience of championing the Internet, and these are some of the networks that we do deploy around the world please if you had a have a chance to talk with someone, please do share about the complementary access solutions called community networks, which can help us to collect the unconnected and push the digital divide that exists in today's world. Thank you so much. Back to you, Jay. Thank you, Naveed, and you're right on time. We've got about 5 more minutes for any questions for Naveed or any remaining questions that folks had for some of our other speakers? Anyone in the queue? I don't see anyone in the room.

So we we are going to keep that alive as well for for redundancy purpose. We are also thinking to make a model network, which would be this average community network and then see if we can help the more larger support communities because there are thousands of them who are are having the same challenges as the people in Kunde and Kumjune villages. Excellent. And one last question. Are you getting any free backhaul from some of the other operators, or how are you backhauling your traffic to the broader interwebs. So we did get some discount from the local internet service provider in terms of the backhaul. you will be surprised to know Jane that a country like Nepal, which is complete land That's another problem that led our company. country screen. The bandwidth cost is around $4 per MB. And when I got to know about this, I was like, okay. and I was calculating how much bandwidth I have in my Dubai apartment, which is around 200 50 megabit per second, and I'd pay around a 100 well, $70 per month. I was like really amazed. So We did get some discount, but still the cost of the backhaul is quite quite high, and and that is understandable given that terrain and problem that Nippal has as a lag. land or country. Yeah. We do have France, Francois Nien, who would like to speak. Sue has a question for you.
