The usual report for me in the ISG, Amir, that's gonna talk about the IAB work, colon about the irtf. Martin Thompsons is gonna give a report on how the noun comes doing this year. We're gonna hear from the LLC from Jay and Jason. Glenn is gonna talk about the trust briefly. Warren, it's gonna have an announcement from the NOK about doing something security related to our Wi Fi network at future meetings, We have 2 in memoriam sessions, unfortunately. And then we have the usual open mic sequence this time ISGIAB and LLC board. Thank you, everybody, who made this meeting happen. That includes, as always, like a target, the meet echo people, the NOC for the network, the LLC staff and contractors, the tools team and the people around the hackathon. Thank you.

And and Nokia is one of them and has been for a long time. very happy for them to do this here. Welcome, Batch. Thanks, Lars, and Thank you, everyone. I hope you're having a great time over here. It is our pleasure to continue to support the ETF because It's been remarkable what you guys have done over the last so many years, Clearly, the big testing time was was COVID. And so Congratulations on the protocols and and all the work that you guys have done and and of course to the network service operators and and the the application writers and all all who kind of held us all together when we couldn't be together. So just wanna give a couple of ideas, I think it's been about 15 years since the last time I came to the ATF. And so it's it's been a really long time. And I wanted to say a couple of things about what I've learned out side of the IETF. and The first thing I'll say is the protocol wars are over. IP has 1, IP does everything. Okay? might have thought, you know, can we do voice? Can we do emergency calls? Can we do video? Can we do critical network infrastructure? rail signaling, air traffic control, yes. can do all okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, Next question. So After we have settled that one question, The next big thing is if we are so dependent on on this network, and I know this is gonna trigger a few people."

Whether it's working from home, it's going to school, it's our entertainment, It's our communications, everything shopping, whatever. It's all on this network. And so are we secure? And I know I haven't been to the ATF, but, you know, the the features and all the stuff that I I look at as we're implementing our products. seem to be oriented towards end to end security. we have these when I talk to our customers, they talk about these large surface areas that they have to protect. And so I would you know, if I had the answer, I would start it off. But I wanna know what you guys think about Surface to surface security. And by that, I mean and I'll give you an example. we see these dDoS attacks. and they launched from various networks They're fairly small. in that particular network the aggregate of them in some network that is being targeted is pretty large. So The target feels the pain But the other guys, they don't do anything to protect. the the one guy. And so is there something we can do in terms of or whatever to to sort of have what what I call surface to surface protection. I'm just gonna leave you a few questions. I'm not gonna have answers for any of But I think it'd be worthwhile talking about this Security is uncomfortable when you talk to service providers, Enterprises, and all, don't wanna talk about their vulnerabilities, and so on. But but I think this is important for us"

The second thing I wanted to say I said, forget about protocol wars. protocols are dead. and You know, I know this is not the right place to say that. But what I mean is we've solved a lot of problems, and we'll continue to solve them here. Okay? But You know, There's there's so many people using the Internet, the Internet, and not just the big I Internet, but Little Internets, Enterprise Networks, the cloud and so on. And you know, We we here, I mean, you guys are smart as heck, and and you come up with all these great ideas. but all the guys who use the networks aren't necessarily That's smart. or Maybe they're smart, but That's not what they wanna use their smarts for. The Internet is a tool for them. And think it's it's very important for us to think about how usable the Internet can be. how from an operations point of view for the service providers from a usability point of view from a consumability point of view, is the unit that consumable. and and as, again, as a simple analogy You don't need to understand lithium ion chemistry to drive an electric car You don't need understand BGP route policies, to to use the Internet. And I think we've solved a lot of these problems, and it's almost like coming up with methodologies, I could say APIs, but I know you guys don't like that. into the into the network so that the network is more programmable.

So, anyway, those those two challenges, I guess, were were the ones I wanted to leave you with. Think about security, because I'm betting my 401k on this network. and think about the the operation side of things. Alright. And Again, thank you for everything that you guys are doing, and thank you for coming to this IETF. and hope you enjoy the rest of the week. Alright. Hang on one second.

And I I think them earlier for serving the ITFS chair for L2 VPN, I heard, which I my memory is very hazy of those days, but I don't think it was always the most easy of groups.

I'm not gonna tell you, but Jay will. there's a bunch of things on ISG statements, announcements, and more things we have online. Those are the registration numbers, and this is the first time as always that I see this slide.

We would love to hear from those of you who might have colleagues that couldn't come or didn't come, why that is. because we obviously have another meeting coming up, and we also need to have a chat about, you know, what do we do about meetings in the US? Because they were the ones that oftentimes actually generated profit for us. And this one won't, as far as I know, and that is sad. We have a fee waiver program. As usual, the remote fee waivers are pretty robustly used. We granted almost 360, almost 250 were actually used. the chairs of the various task forces, meaning me and Colin have questionnaire budget, and we offer in person fee waivers out of those. I had 10 requests. I granted 9. Colin had 13. He also granted 9 And for the A and W workshop, which doesn't usually happen at every meeting, what happens at the summer one, There was another 10 for the workshop. And we had 423 hackathon registrations and I don't remember a curve, but that's almost half the overall in person attendees. So I I pretty sure this is pretty high fraction. So well done to those of you go to the hackathon, especially those of you who arranged the hackathon for us, becoming more and more popular for good reasons. Right? Because open source and open standards really go hand to hand these days And and that's a very robust program that we're running on Saturdays Sundays. So thanks for that. And as you might see for the pie chart, right, most people from the US quite a few from China, Germany, and other European countries. and and a lot of you in the heavy tail from all over the world.

But the in person attendance is, you know, the usual, like, slightly over half from the local. workplace. This used to be the slide where we talked about, you know, how many people that we have and what were the COVID cases. And This slide doesn't show the COVID cases. But as far as I know, we only had one report, and you have to take us with a huge chunk of salt because very few people are testing as far as I know and and probably even fewer people are reporting. So to the one of you who did do that and then hopefully follow procedures to isolate yourself. Thank you very much. But our proposal, I think, from the ISG And LLC would be that because those numbers are getting more and more shaky going forward, we're not gonna report those anymore. That that's a proposal. What we did do this time, though, we are sort of breaking down the post COVID period for the meetings that we had into on-site and remote. So you can see the total, we're actually pretty close to to Yokohama, which was the last meeting, but we're trending a little bit down on the in person participants. And those are the numbers for the IETF 117, the numbers as of today, while the numbers for the other meetings are the final numbers. So you know, we might still pick up a few more registrations tomorrow and Friday. The ISG made a bunch of statements and announcements on Ethertypes, on the RSC series working group chair, We currently have a feedback period out for a few of you who volunteered to be considered for the role of chair. Thank you very much for volunteering. those of you who haven't seen this yet, you know, wanna give us feedback on the candidates, that would be appreciated.

The good news is Some of us on the ISG met with Ted and Alan earlier today or yesterday, my memory is very hazy. but I think we have a way forward to address the content of the appeal. So we're probably not gonna go with the proposed remedy that was in the appeal, but we have an alternative that seems to be acceptable to the people who raised that, and thank you very much for raising us. You know, this is an appeal is not necessarily a bad thing. It helps us fixed things that we missed. And in this case, it turns out we missed a few things. And then we're hoping that the new statement on interim meetings is gonna be serving the community better. There's lots more from other bodies in the data tracker And as always, there's an IETF blog on the bottom that Greg runs for us. If you wanna post the blog, talk to Greg, Greg, where are you? Over here, He's always happy if an author comes and wants to work with him. You don't need to be a long time participant. We oftentimes now also have, like, newcomers that only attended a few times that wanted to share their impressions, and that's always very useful to those of us with, like, here a long time. I don't quite remember how it was. it it really helps us improve newcomer experience and also you know, gives us feedback about what we're offering actually works for those of you who are new to organization. Right. We also have childcare yet again. We've done this ever since we came out of COVID, I think. And and the LLC is planning to continue this forward so you can plan on this being available. at every IETF. And and we do hope you plan to use this. I hear the kids had a great time.

The other exciting thing that's going on is that we are currently have 2 proposed programs that we want to open IAB programs are a venue where we want to tackle technical topic that we think is important, but we also realize that, like, we are only like a small set of experts, and we need external or other experts to help out with.

And the other program will be the e e impact program. It's also proposed at the moment. It's the outcome of a workshop that we had end of last year. and there was, like, a lot of input, a lot of interest, a lot of discussion is still going on. So we believe there is a need for a discussion menu in the community. Both of these programs are proposed programs, so we didn't decide on them yet, but I think very likely we will have them because so far, we got very positive feedback. but there's still time to give us feedback if you would like to give us feedback either. send it publicly to the architecture discuss list or for impact this actually a separate mailing list, or send it directly to the IP. or, again, talk to me or any other IAB member. This is the part where I say thank you for those people who are serving in different positions one of the responsibilities of the IAB is to care about appointments. Very exciting. a very important note as well. And this time, we appointed Susan Wolff for the ICAN nominating committee. big thanks for that because that is a commitment where you really have to be engaged and cost a lot time. We had really good candidates this time, and and Susan is absolutely more than qualified, and thank you for doing it. I'm not sure she's here, but you can see her picture. And then we reappointed Lara Thompson, for the ISO board of trustees, That was also interesting because this is a position where you usually get a couple of appointments and we didn't. We only had her name, but this is because everybody is so happy with her. So we were really happy to reappoint her.

We have to make a trade off of ensuring that we can go to sufficient cities and different cities. And in order to do that, Sometimes that means dealing with the devil. So that's any way forward. But This should be a great meeting. We have finally got everything sorted. So look forward to seeing you all there. But this is our list of upcoming meetings. the one thing you all notice is that the host column looks a little bit stark here. We all As you know, I think the industry is going through a called Patch in some places. We are relatively strongly exposed to a small number of industries, and So we are trying to expand our set of global host"

We are looking at the US. We are also looking Canada, and we have looked at Mexico as well. It is those that work is still ongoing anyway. So we will see where we end up with that For IETF 125 in Asia, We recently did a consultation on a number of cities we might possibly consider going to. Shenzhen, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, and this sample. The IETF board is still considering that and at some point, we'll give make an announcement about how we intend to go a bit further with that. So that's pretty good stack of things now. We have some, I think, organized on that as well. But we've largely caught up from the COVID issues. The the reschedule meetings are all now gonna work their way through and so we can get back to a normal planning cycle. IETF Meetings. Okay. One of the goals that we have is long term financial stability sustainability. And the main way we wish to do that is by growing the IETF endowment. We have a goal of 50,000,000 by 2027, and currently, we're at about 4,000,000 We have some donors that are giving large sums to us. So Aaron have given a large sum to us. The Internet society, of course, gives a a very large amount each year. And right, the NCC are giving us a large donation it over a number of years. This year, we've had Lochnick give us a donation. and or or last year, possibly. And each of these donations is matched"

We're gonna be doing some more things as well help individuals consider supporting us as well. So thank you to all of those people, and that's how we're growing our endowment. Now one of the things that we've discussed before is trying to move towards net0itfoperations. and we've had a project that's been going for a little while. to build a a calculator that works for us. And we're now done some calculations using that for IETF 116. And we are considering the options for offsets of our carbon emissions or our equivalents of carbon emissions. very much recognize that this is a technical organization and that if we went and bought financial credit somewhere and all that kind of stuff, then, you know, I would never hear the end of it. So we are looking at to know more technical based projects and those type of things of how we can do this, more direct things. If any of you have any ideas or if any of you in your organizations have experts on type of things. We would love to talk to them and hear about those things to understand how we can do that There is a side meeting on Thursday at 8:30 where we want to talk about this more, if anyone's free to come Okay.

We do this annually. really just to refresh, you know, key risks to the organization review work that's been completed and our priorities for the coming year. And out of that, the two areas of focus that we remain Sure. you know, keeping in the radar 1 is financial focus. We've made progress there obviously, with Debbie joining the team. The objective there is not just fundraising progress, but also the timeliness and accuracy of financial statements. and pleased to see that we're making some strides there. So that's from our standpoint on the board. And then the final item is that as we look through when certain board terms were ending It became apparent that we may have sort of a a healthy number run rolling off at the same time. And so we're we're studying that to make sure that we have the sort of timing's correct and if we do then try to come up with some alternatives so that we don't lose significant chunk of the board all at one time because that would be disruptive for the organization.

We'll think about it. It's that's a very complex issue. I will point out, you can reproduce RFCs in their entirety That's a granted license that everyone has. And, of course, you can use them in your work. But to create a derivative of work outside the IETF, getting into some interesting issues with potentially enabling other SEOs to use our work. without our permission. and that does create some issues. I think we would need a larger consultation than just trustees themselves would have to be involved in that.

    "text": "Alright. Next up, we have Warren Kumari who is wearing the NOK hat. here, I think, So I wanna make sure that we have time for open mic, so I'll go through this fairly quickly. So this is a proposal from the IETF NOC. which we've discussed with the ISG and LLC. and we wanted to get community feedback. So basically, what we would like to do is we'd like to move from using 802.1x to using WPA. And the note, when I'm saying 802.1x, I'm actually meaning you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, WPA 2enterprise with radius, And when I'm saying WPA, I'm meaning WPA 2 and WPA 3. So what is the plan? It's largely this. we turn off 802.1x, and we turn on WPA. And why do we want to do this? Well, largely it's to make the user experience better. Currently, When you connect to the IETF network, you're connecting to an SSID called IETF. but 802.1x uses certificates, and so you get this certificate And because you can't get a certificate for an SSID, this certificate is actually for services.meeting.ietf.org. and there's no real reason why your machine should trust that. So what we had been doing is we were taking the certificate and we were publishing it on the service called 802.1xconfig.org. And theory was people could install an app on their phone before they came to the meeting, and download the certificate and put it in their certificate store. But as far as we could tell nobody ever really used that, and the service went away. So another thing we tried is we tried publishing the certificate fingerprints online and we would put them on the meeting page, and we would email them out. And as far as we can tell, nobody was checking those either."

We forgot to update the fingerprint. Nobody ever came along and told us or your certificate fingerprints wrong. You're a lot checking them. also increasingly People have managed laptops and managed phones like, corporate managed devices, and they just don't have the authority to install certs. This means that, you know, people can use either 2.1x. and certain operating systems make fairly tricky to try and configure this at all. So we're trying to make it easier for users No. No. No. We usually have 2 or 3 tickets per day related to I can't join the IATF network. obviously, more towards the beginning of the meeting. throughout. As an example for Android, you have to configure the security type and the ETH method and the phase 2 authentication until it's used system certificates and verify them and then enter this long domain. That's just too hard. So if this is such a bad idea, Why did we stop doing it at all? Well, when we launched 802.1xor guess, when we started doing 802.1x in the meeting network, It was in the days of wep. We have now gone through moving from DEP wet to WPA. WPHWPA 2, There's now WPA 3, And we believe that WPA Three is super good enough and that WPA 2 is more than good enough. Also, over the past 5 or 6 years, there's been a huge increase for people moving to encrypted layer 3 protocols. Right? Everybody's running TLS. Let's encrypt has made a huge difference with that. we will serve things like, you know, dowandot and those sorts of things. And so we believe that even if somebody was able to decrypt the"

We also had this idea that we could use 802.1x is ability to put people into different felons, sort of idea that you could join an single SSID, And instead of logging in as IETF, IATF, you could log in as, for example, NATS 4, with the password of net 64, with picture net 64, We never did that. Seems like it's not feature that we necessarily need. couple of frequently asked questions. If we're just doing WPA 2 and we use a single preshared key, probably IETF. IETF is, like, the pre shared key. that mean anybody can just decrypt all the traffic? Nope. Nope. Nope. The pre shared key is used to derive a pay wise transport key. So Same like with radius, you know, you don't use that to encrypt. You just use it to derive a key. Also, why aren't we just gonna do WPA 3? It's the new hotness. Yes. It is the new hotness. Unfortunately, we tested this in the knock. and we were just made to discover some of our devices don't actually do WPA 3 yet. all of the APs and radios and stuff do you know, some of our phones and laptops stood So the actual plan is WPA 3 with a 4 back to WPA 2, So if your device does WPA 3, you'll use that. it's not new enough. If it's not new enough, you want. So, basically, we think 802.1x as more of a fact than it's worth. and would like the community feedback Not now though because of time, we'll send out email to"

And so Martin already said earlier, right, that that he hopes that lots of people get nominated, and he also who helps a lot of people then accept that combination. if you wanna see diversity, that's where it will need to come from because the ISG and the IB and various other bottles have very little ability to to appoint people ourselves.

So so I I agree that, actually, one of the key issues here is trying to get more diversity into the organization in terms of people who are participating because that's where everyone gets pulled into. The one act or one of the actions I think that AD's can take and working with chairs can take is to try and help promote more diversity through the position. So that might be, like, a working with a secretary position or if you're choosing, like, a new working chair, you have that choice of who you're choosing between and might and you may choose to put forward a a candidate that you think that might increase the diversity.

I think that's the way it has to change, but still doesn't fundamentally change the aspect.

What might be really helpful is speak to your colleagues and try and convince more people to come along and participate. so that, you know, our entire community is less made up of old white guys. That would be really helpful. Yeah. In the same way. I am the important part is really to to increase diversity of this whole community. and that's something that the IAB and the ISG has to discuss a lot. But I also have to say just throwing money at the problem doesn't only help it. Right? As Warren just said, we get we get this diversity money from companies, but then the companies are just sending us the same people. So and we depend on who's sent here. So UI all can do a lot there.

The first one is measure. 2nd is analyze. the third is create the right conditions and the 4th is provide support. All of those are things that we're doing at the same time. They're not sequential.

So this meeting, we have somebody walking around who's doing the series of interviews, with women about their experiences within the IETF so that we can understand more about that and understand why people come, what they don't come, what those things are.

My question being the honorary 10 year African in the room coming up from South Africa every time. This is long haul every single IETF. So sticking my kind of stake in the ground, have we considered as the ITS an African meeting even if it's not part of the main rotation. So we are relatively constrained by RFC 8719 about that.

In your slides earlier, you were talking about you had a chart of upcoming meetings the hosts listed, and there are about 8 blanks. You said a couple were under discussion, and there's room for improvement That sounds kind of like there's a lot of room for hosting opportunities So I really like you to drive a point home to say that we really need hosts to step up for our upcoming meetings and maybe give some indication of what will happen in our budget if we don't get hosts for those meetings. Well, I mean, I know I could start, like, the great social that everyone loved won't happen. Right? Lots of other things of of of that effect to happen, and it parts where you wanna go. Right? So at the end of the day, if somebody wants to go to Africa, Right? Somebody's gonna have to help probably write a check for that. So We've never Yes. Please do step up. please do help support us. each of the meetings normally. The the host fee is $390,000. it's a lot of money, but it's a fraction of the cost of the the meeting. And without it, we can port a number of meetings without it, but it gets more and more difficult. And as Sean says, there are fewer things that we can do.

I'm I'm very sorry. please raise it with the responsible air director, and I can guarantee you when it reaches that level, it will not sort of be brushed off it will be taken seriously because an appeal is actually a formal action that that the ISG takes very seriously. will respond to that. Mike, my councilor. So this question is both sort of general access to meetings, barriers to attending, and keeping people returning, as well as the specific EDI. slash to that. is is Can you share how going from fully virtual back to physical has affected you know, access and inclusion. what what I I personally think it's gotten better because there's more people that can come remote. And we the some of the hurdles that we had initially, like, how are we gonna do a home like, fake we kind of have a tool now that, like, helps us with those things. Some people love it. Some people hate it, but I think it does help. do I personally think that the meetings will go fully virtual, and then everybody will you know, always be remote, I think no because I think some of the actual value of the meeting is the actual in hallway in personal conversations that you get to knock out a long technical topic in 20 minutes that can't really do over via email, but that's my personal opinion. So But that but that does bias to people who can afford both in money and in time and supportive employers to be here. Yes. So We have significantly improved the process for remote participants."

The hand raising tool is used. Participant local participants need to use Meteco in order to be able to join the queue so that it's a unified queue. So that has made a substantial benefit, I think, for remote participants. The area where we really haven't been able to provide anything like the same level experience as the social. side of things, you know, the hallway and people getting to meet each other. That's something we would like to tackle, but it seems to be a general problem with this kind of meeting across the world. So we've tried a number of experiments.

And, yeah, how coming back to Mark's words and also, like, questions are being asked in the chat. Like, what is con significant support like, I think instead of thinking about, like, fee waivers for a meeting, it's more a fellowship for a year or more. Like, some something like that when that order. I'm not saying that that's the only way, but Just seeing that, like, we're talking about investments that are much more significant and support people for a longer time to be able to for them to the team because if you pay someone to attempt for one meeting, and then they'll come back the next meeting, you can't wonder why they didn't come back.

Right? They brought people in for for, I think, a series of meetings. and and that that achieved part of that goal, they decided to stop that for various reasons that are that are theirs. But we actually just on the LLC board and and with the ISG, whether the llc can spin something up for for that purpose. would require, like, an order of magnitude more money because it's a significant investment, and we would also need to come up with some community, involvement process for selecting those fellows.

And then for other people, there might be other obstacles And I think it would be quite worthwhile to I mean, I don't know, perhaps, this has been done, but to to look into why actually people feel or are unrepresented. And then try to remove those barriers, which might include spending money on removing those, but it's not the same thing as giving stipends. So It's just an observation from the discussion and they wanted to make that point. And another observation is been pointed out that some people come once or twice, and then they don't come back. Maybe it's because it's not what they were looking for. I mean, that could also happen. So I think we shouldn't jump to conclusions in such matters.
