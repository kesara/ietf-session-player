Murray has two working groups that are both charter that he's the area director for meeting right now, which is very inconvenient.

And then there are four issues open that all ask for minor improvements. We now have the opportunity to roll these things in given that the document is back in the working room, so to say.

So maybe we could start on the references So Francesca, you you brought up the the issue of the references to C and there was... There's was another one they're the that we're github, like and so the the challenge is... So so first of all, that there were two links that we had one with C l r, and one was like the I don't know how to describe it. It's like the... Essentially the D of of the xml data that C uses. I think the The only thing that's needed is this list of less than twenty identifier. And so currently, those are managed by C are. Those are stable in the sense that it hasn't been changed since two thousand sixteen and it's had the same the same github like since that. So we could certainly find another place to put it But but I'm sort of wondering, you know, I I assume this isn't the only time where people essentially use their source code as the as the data that that is authoritative. How do other folks handle that same problem of essentially not having another place other than Github where where data is retained. Don't know Yeah. It's a good question.

You did u c thing as an example, we could also choose another example. Of somebody comes up with one that is easier to do that maybe we should do that. But most people quickly understand this you say example. And my take is that the designated expert whom we haven't given any instructions on this. I'm sorry. That the expert would accept this registration because the serial database is going known in the industry. And it it's clear what what this registration would mean. I mean, it's maybe not not in the library of Congress yet, but it's well enough established so that that implement will know what we do. So the the the actual registration here does not necessarily have the same norma longevity that we would expect for a standard document and that's that's always a problem and this kind of... Let's populate the registry with, at least one Item six. Yeah.

So the this document is about. Adding hints, to date time? Piece of information. And these hints often contain some form of cultural references and in particular, and in this example, we are referencing different kinds of calendars in which this time, itself is rooted in time and work time. In which this timestamp is preferably presented to to user. And that's the hint. And the the c registry is is place where we the Calendars of this world up being collected and information about them is collected and so. There's there's no other place there that is as comprehensive to my knowledge than this one. So the the registration would lose if we were going to to a different source.

There's the the the reference in the current draft of the Rf has a pointer to an Xml file in the C C r is essentially a a bunch of data that defines the normalization for for java for Javascript for essentially anybody that that uses it. And one of those files is a list of calendar names and calendar Ids, the calendar Id's a C policy is it's like a Roach motel as once an Id gets in there, it never comes out. Right? They have we have endless endless backwards compatibility for all of their Ids. And so they had like an rc. Okay. Yeah. And so they've had, I think nineteen calendar Ids, one of them is d and it's marked as d fabricated in that ex file, but Otherwise, it's it it'll be around forever. Now the Url...

No this reference is used I don't know if this was clear from what customs was saying. But there is a aya registry. That mh is defined and there one parameter or the one registered parameter there. And the value that this parameter can take are the one defined by this Cl calendar reference. So this current reference is not in the aya registry say, but there is a pointer to the section that says the value that you can take are these ones. So... Yeah. So That's why.

So this is a a right only register... This is what Uni code considers to be registered street, and it's write only, basically. Or, like, no delete. I is the right way really look at. These... So what once it once once element gets in here with a name attribute on it that that is gonna be there forever. This is pete Resonates. I have a question. How do things get in here? Someone put an application into the code consortium Yeah. So there's a there's a C working group. I actually was at one of their meetings this morning.

There's nothing on the uni unicorn consortium website that points to This list So so the the this source data in turn is used in a variety of other places. Right? So if you go to Md mds for example, the Javascript documentation you'll find the the same list of Ids. There's probably something similar in java right? So all the platforms that actually build on this data we'll document these things, but the the that the sort of source of it is is is owned by C and is checked in by that. Let me ask the question again more carefully. Yeah. The data itself is owned by Cl is the only place they document this data this file On Github I believe so Yes. Okay. Then what I'd suggest is and one of us can go down the hall to the I and desk and talk to them about this. But this is in effect a uni unicorn consortium registry with whom we have liaison and all that other stuff. That we wanna reference, but their particular reference thing right now is a total pain in the behind. Let's go to Ian and say, can you work out with uni code and maybe the Is needs to talk to them where we... What we can point to that is a stable reference.

We talk about When an I a consideration section, for example, if you wanna refer to a registry that I owns, you just named the you don't give the Url the registry... I mean, some recent documents have started doing that. But the longest time, the actual representation of the registry, which is what that is is not what you reference. You just. Because if they could do Json tomorrow, you know what? You... All the Xml things break after that. So just we want an direction that that Cdl Cdr see. Promises will be permanent forever, and then we use that. Okay. And and just to to to clarify that. That won't prevent this Rf for being published. Well, like, do we have to wait a to do that before we get an R number for this? Yeah. Are you in hurry? Well, I mean, depends on what harry means. I mean, this week, no. But, you know, sometime in the next like, few months we're hoping to remove. So one of the things on the on the side, we are hesitant to ship browser implementations of use it that use this format until we're pretty sure that it's gonna not change. And so Mh we would certainly like it to be more official before we, you know, get Chrome and Firefox out there put their neck out.

Decide on on what goes into the register what does not, then there needs to be a section or a paragraph or something in the draft that says, this is what x bird needs to look at. So give some guidance for the expert. And I'm sure Custom has a lot of experience with that I I don't think we need towards miss exactly what needs to go in there. I don't think this is controversial. It just needs to be there and you need to just think a little bit out what can be? What can be like the deciding factors? For that, but in general... Yeah.

Thing we're Actually I managed to leave in the sea see reference the Care world for any antitrust comment? We are the handling is kind of squishy at the moment and and probably needs to be hardened up. A little bit And Tran francesca mentioned that review And I think basically, we we have to balance the fact that we will have to process erroneous instances. With the fact that as soon as you promise to process erroneous instances in a certain way. They defect no longer erroneous.

And how they should be handled in general? And right now, there is some pretty rich what it takes that licenses the reception to reject to not act on inconsistent strings and I think it's important to have that in there... So I would try to rebalance these two phrases to to actually you say the right thing. So I I can share what I put in the in the p so far, which is I split out the text around duplicates from the text around conflicts because I actually think those might be different issues and that for conflicts, I think we already sort of have a plan there At least I thought we did, which is if you have a critical flag, Right? Then it needs to be understood and and dealt with, and if there's a conflict between selling with a critical flag and something else, then it needs to be rejected or it needs to be dealt with in some way by the by the recipient, you know, to fix the problem.

And if you don't, then it's up to the recipient to decide what I do. What do you think is sounds good? Any any objection to that being the the model? Sounds good? And then the the duplicate ones, I I sort of... So if if if essentially what that means is there are duplicates that don't conflict. Right? Which can either be a case where let's say you have a you you have a calendar and then a another calendar and then neither one have the critical flag on them. I think the current plan is that you just pick the first one. I I just don't have an opinion about that either way. I think it's kinda arbitrary. Are there any reasons why we would care about sort of first or last, Well, I don't remember this three of the partition must status is in there at the moment. It's pretty funny because the masters in the section that is entitled informative But that's not the meaning of the word informative of the. So it's it's very funny.

I mean, in the absence of any other precedent, that's sounds fine. With me. Cool. Yeah. I asked for Chapter first because I really would like to reference this in the document. And and I think the the caveat out there is if if anything is marked as critical, then it should take precedence over anything else. Right? So it should be the first"

That's exactly what I I was afraid of that we would come up with the the detailed instructions that you need to be able to eat out of a super. And I would prefer the protocol I not to turn it to sup in the first Sorry I I I lost... You've lost me on that analogy. Yeah the the the the Term soup is a term of art. Alright. For a document that that has lost norma I have a proposal. First, takes precedence if there's any critical and there's anything else then it's it's invalid. Pretty much what I would arrive at. Yes. Yeah. Got it. So so explain Let's can you write an example of because it it'd probably be easier to to see. Yep... That's great. Love it. And I I could just write that into the into the P r that that's so simple. What's one of the other examples from this thing. Good okay. Company. I Chinese is a popular one. Cool.

You can't you can't have a critical item and also have another value with the same thing Okay. That's is interesting. I think I think that's sort of good. You're gonna put a critical in there, then you've got understand it and you go to understand it, then you can't be adding another one. Okay. Cleanup. Yeah. Cleaner than trying to go well you must do the critical one and ignore the other one even if it's first, because that would be just a obnoxious Yeah. That that makes a lot sense. So this is may behavior of the recipient. Because recipient may also so reject the whole thing if... I mean, the recipient can reject whenever it feels like. Yes. But... Yeah, I think think if you got multiple you're already on in us. You got multiple on one of them is critical then you just bad And you wanna open up this this one here. Yeah. Wow"

I was just gonna write something completely obnoxious just in the chat. But I could stick it here. Okay. Just what I was gonna say Yeah. But that's significant you that just being silly. Yeah. I mean, that's how you do it. Right? Yeah. That's good. If you care, you reference is specific copy. Yeah. It's does the terms zone database give you the history information, you would need to actually look in enhanced version numbers. I mean, you can get it if you want to, but in practice Systems generally keep one copy and one copy only and it replace field ones. So I think the answer there is if you want that level of decision, then you need to define a new extension that not yeah. The legacy java compatible existing times zone extension, but something new, and it's totally reasonable to do that, but it's"

It's like one twenty two in the morning for me. So Alright. I have sympathy. Cool. So that sounds like that's done. Okay. Let's open this pretty new the Carson years about Gmt Yeah. There was one comment that said we are mentioned turning these legacy Gmt things that are thought and encoded the wrong way around And we probably should... I not mention them or eric caveat that these are totally weird. Oh, here we go. I think again I just removed mentioning this time zone completely. Yep. We can today. Click in click on that. I did click on that Yeah guy. Did that. I think I'm clicking. I'm clicking the wrong. We go. Yeah. That correct. Yeah. We go. That's the actual change. Good. Yeah.

So so so I think we're it looks like we're pretty good here. I think the that terminology one it it seems like we're Carson gonna take a look at that and close it if it's already addressed. And I think we've now addressed the duplicate issue, and I will add another commit to the P r that adds the what what what... What Braun, what you just suggested around rejecting any duplicates if any of them are are critical. I think that's a great idea, and it will be super easy to to right in there, and then I'll I'll I'll add a commit that you know, their essentially references this issue. And that way, all three of these issues here can get closed if we merged the p. That sound good. Okay? Perfect. You. Alright. Okay. We have five minutes remaining. I would like suggest that once this document is has completed it's passed through the system that we closed the working group. I... That's what I am feeling the consensus of the group, is it anyone have anything to say about that. Any any other work you would like us to do that you believe is in data. Fantastic. Thank you.
