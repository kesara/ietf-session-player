Tolson could not be here this time and an update on pvd\u0027s from Tommy so there was another hackathon and more participate participation at the hackathon there\u0027s some implementation work and Kyle has a presentation the if you download the document there the thing materials are linked there Midori and here also I guess under Shikha project remotely and they sent some documents that are linked all the materials are in the github working group materials repository there\u0027s also some code they tried to see about detecting captive portal things they have some code for that right so we had a milestone to have a protocol to discover interact with captive portals we adopted an architecture document in Prague we still have 77 10 and PVE in the mix we need to decide at some point what to do about that what hopefully today and I suppose that will come up in the architecture npvd latter half of this session we also have a milestone "

    "text": "thing do we want to avoid that because one option we have is to say that we have a new ICMP unreachable code point that says by the way I\u0027m captive and this is coming from the enforcement device and presumably the enforcement device knows whether or not you went through the captive portal API already so you could imagine that I mean so it knows how I ever opened this so if I go through the new path to say I discover the captive portal API I say oh look you\u0027re you\u0027re there I\u0027m going to open this up the ICMP is a great way to say now you have closed right to say you used to be open now you have closed and presumably anyone who\u0027s implementing the new captive for LAPI stuff would be aware of we could say you have to be aware of the captive portal ICMP blocking responses and used as a mechanism but anyone who did not already open up their portal maybe we don\u0027t generate the ICMP for them or we generated in some legacy compatible way just jumping in rotator again you\u0027ve got a very good point there and I\u0027m in my opinion as I speak the problem with saying destination unavailable with the ICMP message in the presence of a captive portal is is that\u0027s actually not what happens in practice if there\u0027s a captive portal in the way there is the destination it\u0027s just not the destination you thought it was hence probing works so having destination unreachable no that\u0027s actually the wrong response and for all the reasons you know Tommy just came out with yeah it\u0027s it\u0027s gonna battle battle old kit so a new code for those who are aware of it to say hey you\u0027re captive portals your traffic\u0027s probably not going where you think is it\u0027s probably wise who wrote it so does that sound like a reasonable way forward which is to say have we well let me say Lorenzo raised a point does anyone want to speak to that point because I don\u0027t I don\u0027t think we we got there let me ask another questions like is is a clear text notification really the best we can do here like we\u0027re defining a greenfield deployment with an API and we\u0027re really saying well you know the first strategy for this isn\u0027t on is it basically an unauthenticated ICMP message is that really the best we can do can\u0027t we at least like stuff a token in it or something oh yes so alright his spitballing on this one on the fly the ICMP unreachable contains a slice of the packet that triggered the triggered the ICMP unreachable we can hash Mack that with a key that was advertised by the API server it\u0027s effectively signing it with the symmetric key words so somehow when you contact the EPI first you learn like a public key or something ability of the and then it signs to pack it with whatever private key was there "
