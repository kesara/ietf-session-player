We actually have a full contingent of, working group support at this meeting. We have, also Janice Farcus online, You sure are online. And in the room, our in room delegates who are helping us out, thank you to Belage Vargas. And Don FedEx. I've already put in chat, a link to our joint minute taking. Please jump to there and help us. I'll, of course, mention that again a few times while I do the intro session. This is a IETF meeting. Which means our processes and rules apply everything you do here becomes part of our permanent record. You should be familiar please take a look. If you go to the the link in chat. That'll take you to the the minute taking, which will also take you back to the working group page, and you can find these slides and and also where to get our note in addition to, governing our rules of disclosure, we also have rules that talk about how we treat each other.

So that's great to see. Thank you all to attributed to that We have a fair number of documents post last call and submitted to the ISG. The first set of 4 are in the RFC editor queue. That means the hard work has been done, and now we just have to go through the editing process and it's very good to see Again, the, the, the hard work air for the group has put in yielding the the most rural results.

There have been an email him has postponed on, Practically speaking every step, and change these are linked. The actually originates from a review of, the previous, Draft version 16 before the previous IETF, and most of these, suggestions have been made during this review. And, Including this new figure, So in that email, you can find this figure which is now part of, as a proposal, as a contribution part the current version 17 draft up for discussion.

And, we have, introduced for that, not the forwarding supplier and the definite, supplier And, actually, what we have now with the focus on wireless in row, is, the wireless or radio sub layers underneath under the dotnet layer. And, I think a key component of row is, dot0api. That, gives, an interface between the classic, that net layers and and the wireless layer. And opens up the possibilities in support of the wireless aspects that have been presented in, the specialties presented in the raw architectural draft And, a key aspect of of what we have been doing in the road work is, reliability, addressing reliability, improving reliability So this figure illustrates, the location of the different reliability features for example, a couple of examples are given the radio Leah has the hark And, we have defined, for that, not the the preote functionalities in the that net service supplier. 1 of the proposals in in the row is the faster reaction to the failures or updates changes in the, wireless condition, And, therefore, the PLR has been introduced. And, the way I see it is it is closer located to the wireless layer, in order to be able to react. So it's, part of the forwarding sub layer. And it has inputs from radio conditions"

With the half of dawn, we have updated, the definition of, arc And, the rest are, a major update is that actually giving the focus of of, row API.

So therefore, there was an update to revise, the use, and actually remove the term. And focus on the Pro API. Give more, explanation only. There were other parts where the, part of the previous drafts, but make it more explicit. For example, there's new text in the introduction. Section, capturing the essence of the which, which actually makes cross layer optimization possible. For example, for the reliability features, So, technically, we still have the same capabilities.

Then I'm happy to do do this cross check and put a the process for the changes. And I think we have been discussing it before that the the architecture draft still goes on to this updates.

Yeah. Free to take it as a chair comment or a contributor comment. In looking at the document and getting ready for it, you know, to to the next last call, I do see that there's, other inconsistencies in, the document, notably in the definitions, there's a lot of repeat of text from outside of the document. And some of the repetition is not quite the same.

Basically, there are 2 main sections, section 4 on the in the wireless Industrial Services today. So those that are white based on an 802.11 with no additional kind of, technologies on top.

I have a a comment and You also touched upon it, during your verbal report in the previous slide that Actually, I think and I may be wrong, but I think less requirements are technology independent. So they are requirements in case there is a wireless, domain segment, hope for whatsoever. But as you said, this was So and I and that's what I found in the draft. This is Wi Fi Focus. And I don't fully understand why do we have to pick on any of the wireless technologies when we craft requirements. So are requirements that, can be addressed by either raw technologies.

Recently, there were many discussions on what functionalities we would like to define in that network group in order to provide that bonding latency.

So that that can be also a a new direction to those discussions. When we look to the mobile systems, 3 gvps defining in various releases, these systems are are working on.

When we look to to the mobile them, then, there are various components, how this virtual definite router is defined. It is binding together with the use that plain functionality. And if you compare the wired and wireless, virtual nodes, that not nodes, there are for use differences. So on this slide and those in the in the in the draft, we have just listed these significant differences. And, we have very much focused in a dedicated section on the latency correct stick. But there are also some other interesting differences, I think, but but we should consider when we are designing end to end the debt network. One is the physical distance of a port. If you have a node, then you have practically the centimeters between the port. The ingress and the ingress ports. This is not the case if you have mobile system, and, you have a virtual adnet node. Because on that that virtual definite node, you can have hundreds of meters or even kilometers between the ports that you are using in, on that wheelchair through the There is also a difference regarding the number of ports.

In in in legacy and and normal scheduling algorithm designs, You are practically assuming that your your packet delays that amministic between the ingress and the egress points. However, the debt modeling that the wall mobile system is, model as a virtual dotnet router, the radiolink characteristics became an internal forwarding delay component.

I think I'd love to understand, characterization of c worst case impact of non debt net traffic to the latency. Right? So in in in in wired dead net, the worst case impact is really in the order of a single packet that is still being send out while, you know, the, the next packet can be a dead net packet. Right? So that's, that's a very small, very fixed, understood latency. And I guess with all the complexity that you're mentioning, would be lovely to read some some description of what the worst case impact of that other traffic is, right, just to distinguish between all the difficulties that you get in late because it's radio. And all, you know, whatever is flying through and all this stuff versus the impact of competing traffic right, because the larger the impact of competing traffic is the larger, there would be really the consideration that, well, maybe 5 g as it stands is not a good solution if we really want to have hard, deadline limits, right?

And one of the big thing, I think the discussion do is for all the summary of each of them. Right? So the, the authors here are from from the folks that I work with where we are reviewing our draft, but for any of the other mechanisms, please come to us so that we can add a a short section on each of these mechanisms so that the folks in 6 men and maybe at some point in time MPLS or so have an idea about what metadata does what stuff for QS if if if they will give us extension header, space for it.

Let let me stay on the net net stuff. So think one of the things, and I think we're having another presentation, in the second dead net meeting, I think there is really a a shift in how much QS we can develop more quickly coming to even high speed hardware. And that's because of programmable QS, which we didn't really have So that, the pay for stuff, the the the queues where you can push in that's being shown now with the latest, research papers from CMU and last a year from, from, from Huawei, and and other universities. So I think the programmable QS is going to give us a lot more options in, in a few years, and I think so we're right in time to to to start working on these algorithms now. And then, of course, also the ability to have more flexible headers without going back every time to the idea necessarily would also even allow to use the same header for proprietary ones. Right?

Right. So, if we're using a separate extension header, it would be just next header, header extension line is the standard ipv6 format and then we would have free space from which we allocate, then we subdivide that space, for example, into IETF standards, experimental, and maybe even configurable. And of course, the, the, the the usual different schemes on what degree, how much, do you need to approve, you know, standard, there's expert review and all these things. So those are things would have to be worked out to be able then start, allocating methods in into this space.

So I I don't wanna bother you with all the details. That's why the draft is for. Let me get to the to the the the beefy slide. You know, kind of Next slide. Yeah. So everybody loves ASCII art. We're trying to get rid of that, but still, so sorry, it's way too slow, too too small, right?

And but then when it goes to the hop by hop ones, here are for mechanisms and, and it's already, you know, when I was talking around with the authors, really writing down what the metadata are, what resolution it should Okay. It should be microseconds and then 32 bits are enough. We need overview. So, I mean, even having, such such header discussion brings us closer to one degree of discussing details that algorithmically has been so far say, been been left behind because there are they're just too practical for the algorithm, but they're needed once we get closer to the wire. So, yeah, so the C score, that's, really the the cool thing, in time. So it has service rate and then finish time, So we need, what is it, 48 bits the TCQF, that was really designed to have very little bits. Right? So we're still trying to stuff it.

So the point of a lot of the stateless stuff is to minimize the amount of control plane operation that we need to have. And the minimum that we understand is that we need to on ingress into the network, do some polishing against flows anyhow so that, we won't receive crap that is overloading our network. And that point in time also inserts something like, a routing header for the steering of traffic on a reserve path. And then, for example, this QS header.

But this information, would not be used in, ipv6 data same same same same same same same same same same It will be used only by the pre auth function. Yes. Which is the which does not belong in ipv6. It a definite, right? that's that's that's right. Belongs in belongs Oh, Well, but so right. So this is now the interesting question. What functional difference do we get out of declaring such a header a, an ipv6 transport header as opposed to an ipv6 extension header. Because if we define something for ipv6, it has a general lickability to IP V Six Networks. Yeah. So who it? And the needs Who needs? I Oh, I mean, I mean, the kind of when I was talking to people who've been doing, you know, highly resilient multicast which is exactly the, you know, dual path life life transmission. With the duplicate elimination based on sequence numbers. They all love to have that in the network. Yeah. They can have it. If they need it, they can put it in their application. Right, right, right, right, right, No. I mean, if you wanna do the merge in in an box device, you would prefer not to have to, figure out another signaling and putting this stuff into for example, a new UDP have or so. Yeah. Because, again, See I mean, why why do we have to Next thing. Because we would not We don't have time to arrive to the mutual conclusion and agreement, today. But we have it in MPLS, right? So that's we we do have the sequence number in MPLS. We have in No. No. We have in that net control word. It's different. Excuse me. It's not MPOS label stack. It's definite control word. Okay. Please don't misrepresent. Next thing is, You suggest that time stamp will be microsecond. I it seems to be too crude"

So we need to understand that overloads data plane Deknet, resources with additional information that otherwise can be Because it's static. You don't change your packets. And their information every other packet. Right? So provisioning something for that net saves you, precious resources in your data plane. So I would say that at least for Dayton, deterministic networking, where we care about, latency and packet loss. Overloading, data packets with information that otherwise can be provisioned it's not a good proposition. So That that's the whole point. Right. The scalability that we're trying to do is for when you run out of space to provision every individual dead net flow in the large network right in the same way. Can I finish? Sorry. In the same way as we would be saying, we would rather like to have segment routing to do source routing and and and reroute it as opposed to hop by hop fixing up the path. Yes. I do know that the standard Dennet architecture today. Effectively says every individual debt netflow or aggregate thereof you'll steer up hop by hop, but the whole scaling of the US discussion was based on, eliminating that need for, the poor hop QS operation. Was the whole purpose. Yeah. Well, the thing is that, again, I don't see how Control plane. Will strain that net, data play out of resources. Because effectively, the control and management plane for, dead net flows It's out of bed."

To be queue, and we have 2 minutes. here in the I would like to tell us, please stay, tell us, please stay at the on Right. Because I have 2 comments and I see one as well. First comment is that Honestly, I do not really like approaching other working groups until the death network group has made some decision. So the skewing discussions are ongoing. We are progressing, but there is no selection. There is no working group document. Is in the contribution. So far. That's fine. We can tell that the other working but group, the whole point is that serializing something where, what would happen after, you know, we're finishing something and only then we go to another work and then we're stumbling and we'll have to, you know, undo what we've done before. That serialization can also, put, you know, our work at serious risk. I don't see it's under work, but at least we therapy. And the other thing is second one coming to my mind is this proposal is kind of like, I think a blank check on the others. And, then everybody does, but ever. point. That's what it looks like to me. No. No. No. That's the right Right. No. No. That's that's not true. Right? So one of one of one of the core question to sign, of course, is, what can we, you know, put in as requirements for any, you know, allocation, within that header, to allow such an allocation scheme and approval of the mechanisms be done by other parties than 6 men itself. Right? So, I mean, we we we we have a lot of we have a lot of registries. Where, basically you have very strict admission rules, what you need to do. So to meet that, And with expert review, we have, working group review We have standardization experiments. So, I mean, we have all these schemes in the IETF. The question is"

I wanted to let go and make the point, but, for several years. I I I think I think Von needs to take it to the list. Unfortunately, we're out of time. You know, I I I think, the the last few minutes really highlights that we don't have agreement on the approach Torres, I think you said something interesting right there at the end about, getting information on what is viable and what is not from 6 man would be useful. I don't think giving specific proposals necessarily the best way to So if you want to get that information from 6ban, I would suggest asking it in a general form that would be good information to bring back to the working group. And Sure. And and allow allow us to have that as separate input from all this, I think pretty strong disagreement on what you're proposing. The the specifics. Yeah. And and maybe you've gone a little bit ahead. But we and with that, we are definitely over and thank you all for a really good session. Thank you all to the the note takers and those who participated. I, Eve took fabulous notes. Thank you. And, also thank you to the in room delegates. Thank you, everyone. Talk to you on Thursday on our second session. Thank you. Thank you. Bye June, I guess. I don't know who the battery"
