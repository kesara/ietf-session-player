    "text": "we\u0027re thinking about the point that the endpoint can be compromised and this body focuses on communications is it important to look at what contribution does the communication have to compromising at endpoint as part of that threat one so just it\u0027s again something they to consider as part of what\u0027s been a pretty broad you know view which I appreciate sure Laura and slim blade thinking about maybe breaking thing to down into thing to a and thing to B or thing to a is the equipment software and implementation is to do something and thing to be is the service or the the entity that\u0027s actually operating stuff so I believe the attestation and what we\u0027re going after in rats and eat his thing to a it\u0027s the implementation but a lot of the discussion here around is is around privacy and trusting the service and with your credit card or your data that\u0027s thing to be so the equipment and the implementations could be great but the guy that\u0027s operating the service is selling it out the back room to somebody else or he forgets to do software updates or something like that so that\u0027s really more that almost seems like server auth or service off which is I consider quite different from attestation and I think we\u0027re gonna I\u0027m hoping rats and eat stays away from the service part and just sticks to the implementation part okay kakoton I just want to try and attempt to and clarify about all the previous presenters Ming was trying to say I don\u0027t think necessarily it was work that should be done but probably the idea is that here we have we assume the end system engaging protocol is not being compromised I think there\u0027s like a third assumption which is that I am NOT an attacker the person sending the transmission so so I think so the consideration is an example you said like you know why would you think encryption is a bad thing I don\u0027t think anybody wants to say hey encryptions bad let\u0027s stop doing it but then it does has negative security impacts as well as positive I think yesterday they\u0027re mentioning for example researchers can\u0027t see why ot devices are doing because it\u0027s all encrypted so then it has privacy implications you have devices now sending your data out to who knows where and you don\u0027t know because everything\u0027s encrypted no that doesn\u0027t mean we should stop encrypting things doesn\u0027t mean maybe even we should think about this but I think that\u0027s the general concept and as you look like you were answering that point was that yeah I was trying to get in there because I feel increasingly uncomfortable in that discussion because it started off with to me like okay there challenges with endpoint security but I hear people "

    "text": "saying oh that be the reason why we then man-in-the-middle our existing protocols to make things even worse but I I would like to offer an alternative on as you know I work for arm and we also have our friends from Intel in the room we constantly increase or add features to hardware providing extra security features and of course it\u0027s a it\u0027s a race against lots of the attackers who are very very motivated commercially funded etc etc but we will definitely appreciate support from also from this community in making use of those hardware security mechanisms we have lots of open source projects and I can send pointers to the list on what we do and if some of you guys who care so much about security want to improve endpoint security help us to improve some of the operating systems the firmware on some of those other mechanisms rather than just writing one document after the other and say oh the work is so bad so let me suggest that we don\u0027t have the breaking TLS discussion in unless the 80s want to do it all over again and so in general for me in this work we assumed thing one is still necessary and I think for me that closes off some of those discussions at those funny non optimal crypto things some people might like to do so I\u0027m Debbie Cooley from NSA I\u0027m gonna take you out of the weeds and back up to the space where you belong here so determining what threat is is applicable to the system you\u0027re in depends on what you have purview over right so you have access to this space and you need to consider the threats that are applicable against that space you\u0027re begun to reach into the endpoints in the IETF where you perhaps haven\u0027t in the past and so the endpoint now comes into the into the purview where it may not have been in the purview before so you it needs to be a holistic look at threat to base on what the system is the attacker is always going to be one up on you always right because you have to protect everything and he just has to attack the thing that\u0027s the easiest and he wins right at that point so you have to spread your resources out amongst the whole thing and he gets to pick the one thing that you\u0027ve missed right so the first thing you need to decide is exactly what your space is what part does the ITF have the most ability to affect and then you design your threat documents your threat statement of threat to meet that if you want to delve into the endpoint security case which you have already started to do then that comes into it and then thing two becomes part of the game yeah mostly I guess "

    "text": "where I would phrase it differently is I don\u0027t think the ITF has reached in there the definition of endpoints has changed over the last decade or so in ways that have some impact on our threat matter so so we need the endpoints to be good right so the thing to statement needs to be true in that we need the endpoints to be not compromised I\u0027m not sure I agree in general no no positive statement right so I need I need my endpoint to be a good thing I need not to have an attacker inside of it so so one of the things in discussing this we we\u0027ve been talking about but haven\u0027t come to something some definition of is maybe if you think about this as a protocol between multiple parties if they\u0027re all compromised probably it\u0027s game over but if one of them still isn\u0027t maybe there\u0027s something we can do better than we\u0027re doing there so that if that party has access to everything then I would still say game over it depends we may be able to do better than nothing as far as I guess but I do think you need to look at things holistically it\u0027s just a one-size-fits-all game right so it just depends on what the protocol is and what it affects based on its gonna determine what you need to care about and it\u0027s really unclear whether we can come up with something generic enough and then reduce it to something simple enough actually useable does those are all unclear things yeah all right to be clear we\u0027re cutting lines at the folks that are in the queue right now okay so today your game so from Symantec so I think it\u0027s very clear that if you have a prime of just naming stuff so somebody said what is the common language to discuss what is an endpoints actually it\u0027s even worse we don\u0027t have a long way to describe an attack surface internal attack surface external attacks from other forces we don\u0027t have a model to describe the attacks and then back to the gentleman from arm I think that very good points they are doing stuff on the yard where people are doing stuff India Brazilian people are doing some in the application and on top of that there are other things you need a suit party on top of that so we don\u0027t have a mother to only sticky look at the security for all of these pieces together so I understand the debate what does it mean for protocol designers I\u0027m too young here to discuss that the only thing I can offer so the work we\u0027re doing with mark over there is try to put words on things so that at least we start from the same baseline and I promise you it\u0027s already very hard so if you are interested please help but at the same time please you and Jerry give us input what you need from us I don\u0027t know maybe we have a way to find a good collaboration mother Thank You Kathleen we already so I do think we need to go into two and that we have been already I think where I differ from Deb\u0027s comment is that I mean ideally we\u0027d keep everything secure "
