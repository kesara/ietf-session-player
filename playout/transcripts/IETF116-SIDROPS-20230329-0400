We designed this stuff, we kind of thought that the scale of the number of publication points on the order of the number of Irr instances.

I if I compared to Rp and Ro, for the longest time, all kinds of of documentation from sources would make suggestions like just add a Community depending on the validation states.

Yes. So I think the the the reason that it becomes important is ultimately because border routers can disagree about the set of Vps or Vr in that they're learning from caches. And so it's not necessarily that the same validation state would be applied across the whole network.

So the the was a bit different from the the roller case because there's this disconnect between the thing that arrives at the router the in the Rt stream versus the the profile merging. The kind of logical merging happens at the Rp rather than than the Bg speaker. And the scenario that I've got in mind is you if you imagine a an operator that in reality has two upstream. And for some reason, only publishes an with one of them in there. And that's breaking something for your customer base, and you wanna kind of fix that for them using slow. If you then go and create they only publish a when in reality it's supposed to be a and b. You go and publish you you go and create learn file. That overrides that with a plus b. Yeah. And it club the original. If they then go and fix it and also add c You don't see c. Until you turn out and it's not obvious that there's a feedback loop anywhere else. That tells you that you've got something to fix. I think that these the assertion should be semantic equivalent to an asp per object not the kind of post merge set that comes out of the other side of an rp. Do you see what I mean? So I think they should be there should be inputs to. They should be they should become kind of self contained, but they should be inputs to the union not outputs. Does that make sense?

And kind of, I would not see any reason to expect that clean up what happened for something we create to be used like old As sets in in I, I would not see any incentive that hasn't been there in Irr as well and obviously hasn't worked. Fair points? Jeff, I will keep this. Point one, I don't think you should for as to have a party to opt out. If I have As users, I don't want to actually have the abuse of party remove themselves. Point two. For your What do we do about I? There are things that Ira gets used for including building customer list local registry. That sort of thing that I'm not sure you'd want to do locally. Given all the procedures you have to do crypto to be part of our. There's probably still gonna be a home for Irr, even separate. Perhaps, perhaps. Thank you. Thank you."

He worked closely leave with me through the revisions for Version twelve and also version thirteen, also many thanks to many people who participated in the working group last call Next one. So So the summary of the working group last call is that there has been significant feedback in discussions. During the call. And I took all the... I... I mean, I like through all the comments carefully and considered them and incorporated changes in version thirteen as needed. So I think the version thirteen, fourteen him very nicely, very good discussion. During this last last call. So most of it is in I think very good shape. I mean, I think all of it is in very good shape now. Some discussions are continuing as you might have noticed on the side list. And those I think have more the implementation questions, details of the implementation, primarily having to do with what I call the eva the... I mean, the Asp payload. And from that, you get the set of provider As. Provided As which Common which we called spas. So it's the spas. The set of provider As coming out of the verify verified Spa payload how do you organize them in the implementation? Do you have a single table or do you have to separate tables, one per a."

It is the implement choice to have a single table or two tables So so that's something that there people like claudio and martin and others will will sort through But I don't think it has an impact on the As be verification draft. If... If it is necessary to mention a little bit about that we could, but the Asp verification draft case is that there are three inputs to the half check function. The customer a potential provider, which is the next hop in the asp part and then Air. And it wants a result out to say whether it's a provider, not provider or unknown. Next slide, please. So the key highlights section three, four and five, a lot of good discussion, a lot of good feedback. So So those sections I have worked carefully on in incorporating the the feedback from the working group last call. The text is now much clearer regarding the S speed registration recommendations think it is in good shape everything that people wanted to have is in there. And and I have added new explanations, explanation text on the Asp pathway verification properties, which at least one person already found it quite useful that he's igor, he and I had some discussion about that today. So just to share that what that is about with you, let's go to the next slide. So essentially, I'm gonna talk about next slide. Three properties. And so when you talk to somebody, about Over dinner or just to to to to to have a good conversation about be what it can do for you. It's it'll be good to have this"

I mean, like I do a towards a customer or to a collateral peer, And that route ends up being routed leak somewhere in the past and it reaches As from a customer lateral peer. And that route Asp just by these two says doing Asp and nobody else in the internet is maybe not even doing Asp. Just by two as is doing this, those those that route, which is a leak will be definitely detected at Asp And that is simply because when a route is received in the upward direction, all that is... All that is needed to call it leak is that just one As should be invalid. And here clearly if As has an Asp, if it is sending something downstream to a customer, that hub is already not provided. I We shouldn't use the word invalid. Not provided. So they if one hop is not provider, then the whole path is it turns up being at outlook outbreak, if it is being received, from a customer or a natural peer. So very simple. Second property next slide. A of the first property is that in effect, if most major Isps are compliant, the propagation of route leak in the internet will be severely limited. That follows from the first property. Third second property, Again, the whole Internet is not doing as pa, but just these two As and we are doing Asp. As is Attacker who is sending forced origin prefix hijack involving As. And just by the fact that As has an Asp registered"

So this this next property third one. So here now you might ask you I'm talking about, like, receiving allowed from below from a customer or from a lateral peer, that is what property one and two are. And that is still good because we are saying that in the whole Internet only two us are doing it doing Spa and since they are benefiting, Now that is consider like, a group of As which I'll interconnect, which are which are contiguous and they are doing Asp. And in that case, the property three says that any doubt leak that that is that has the full route. All the As are within this Asp island. If there is a route leak, it will be definitely detected by any of these As. And also, if some route is coming from outside and and it passes through this. And the segment of the part where these As are involved, that segment, if there is if there happens to be at outlook, it will be detected. The only the thing required here is that the three as that are involved in a outlook click that we say is happening here. Those three As should be in this Asp island. That's all that is required. And then this island is is protected in some... In terms of being able to detect route leaks that involve any three as in this island. So That's that's the property number three. We can go on to the next slide. So now, yes. So those are the like properties which are beneficial. But what what is the"

So most of these As are I mean, all of these As are doing gas six for some reason does a part my path manipulation. And it is a provider to customer seven and it is doing an attack on its own customer, which would hopefully, we can think of those as rare Nevertheless, it has the ability to manipulate the path and get away with it. So if it if it is it receives the valid part, multiple valid paths, it can ignore all of them and it can it can have a... It can pretend that it is connected to two are connected to three and as a lateral peer, are provider customer relationship, and it can shorten the path and send it to seven, seven would not be able to detect that there has been a path manipulation So so that is a short coming which we can overcome if Bg is implemented, so it can Bg can provide full layer part protection. But it lacks route leak protection. So we would use Asp and Bg in a complimentary way. Next slide. Sorry that's it. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Questions? So we're in the middle of last call with this. The last updates. We're just made. Let's make sure that we can close working group last call Roofs. Were queues law You. You're sorry about that. Take it to the mailing list. Thank you. Thank you.

With a parent or obligations server you need to do an exchange of files. There's some additional information in here, but most importantly, you communicate a cell signs Dp business I Ta certificate in this way. That is used in signing request already the provisioning protocol that's used to customer of certificates and the publication protocol. Next slide. Next Yeah. I wanna replace those keys. Because, you know, It's not happened. Carry? Yeah. I'll I'll be... Yeah. So you might think this is easy. Right? You just upload these files again then it will work. Right? But... No. Next slide, please. Yeah. So... Yeah. No. From the charles perspective, and I'll get to that and did is not so bad but especially from the balance, it's it's more complicated because you need to keep track of which key to use where and when and Unless you wanna accept that, you know, a lot of soft breaks in between. Next one, please. Because, you know, for the child, If stuff breaks, it's not so bad because you're in the process of driving this change. Now some implementations support that you upload a new file and that they will just use the essentially just use new certificate in there has the key from that point. And and ignore everything else. And then things will work fairly smoothly. And other implementations you actually have to redo the set."

From the parents perspective or publication server, this is much more complicated you really need to keep track of which key to use for which child you the child contacts user, so you have no way really. To just change your key and know the best that might break issues for many people. Next minute, please. So I think we should try at least to be better. This is initial idea of how we could do planned rules from a channel perspective what it tries to do here is minimize the moments that the child the parent have to do things. So it's trying to use the exist thing xml tags to kind of signal that's Okay. The brown has my request. It's okay to use a new key from my perspective because they've seen us. And the parent could conclude by just seeing the new key being used in signing that the old key is therefore, no longer needed. You could also introduce more manual steps here. Next slide, please. The more important one is plant roll from the burns side Well, they will have to create a new key. But then well, they have to do outreach through many channels to reach all role if they have few Children, then it's maybe also so bad. But you have to reach all of them. And they will at different times. Do an update. Right? So they can use the response the a trick we can use here.

I think the bar will have no choice but to say, we've taught you enough times, and it's really time to move on. Next slide, please? Similar. Next slide Automation. Yeah. So residential show that obviously. But imagine that you have fifteen hundred delegated c running the own system or delegated the publishers. Then reaching out to all of them can become a bit problematic. And so I also want think about automating this process in inbound I think we're going to need an acceptance timer or some sort something like that. I'll get to that in the moment. Yep. Gracefully first negotiation is very important if we're going to do this inbound Next slide, please. Next slide. We'll skip this one. We can do with headers, but I think a better id idea might be I think you Ts for suggesting it. Is that we will use a non critical extension in the end certificate that's included in the responses because then we can do a normal exchange a where Charles? Can pick up on the fact that okay, just just... See bounce here advertising that they do all versions of this protocol so we can then start to use it. Next slide, please? Yeah. So you would do no your normal, version exchange. I think we also need to think about it down. Great like what is the parent Son is no longer able to do this.

And this is to avoid, you know, the temporary access to a can enable people to just, you know, make a quick role and you don't it. So I I I would think that, you know, you want to repeat this for while and at some point when they I got acceptance time and expires. The plan would accept a new key and reply this well say, just with the child essentially and then they can use a new key. Next slide, please. From the parents perspective, I made a slide before the idea of using extensions. So here, I figured, well, maybe the next version of the protocol we use a slightly different normal interaction say list is used in the the provisioning protocol to ask you what are my entitlements actually, I think using an extension here would be better. So maybe the parent can include in their response. And the entity entities certificate some critical extension that says, I have other keys. This can prompt the child to talk to the parents say, hey, I heard thank you at keys. Tell me. Start a timer, keep asking if, you know, the brown keeps telling me? I have a new key. And the timer are expired, and I could say, okay. I have accepted your key. And well that's basically be the idea as it currently is. Next slide, please. Because that's more about process. So"
