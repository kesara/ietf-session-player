This is Mary Sol. So we'll give this presentation, Georgios, yeah, the first to kick things off, we'll talk about, green metrics and models and and and simplification. Basically, to provide the data, that we need to sort of basically probably talk about everything else. Next slide, please. So there are there have been some discussion and also prior to the formation of the impact, for instance, in, in, in MRG, there's basically there's a draft, that talks about challenges, opportunities, were to, to, basically, improve the sustainability of networks this charges are structured in certain ways, but questions, of course, what is actionable here, which areas provide promise the greatest impact and what are the enablers follow screens which are being discussed. And that's basically where the data comes in. Next slide, please. So, clearly, it all starts with data. There's this, is Adash, but Peter Drucker, you cannot manage and you cannot optimize you cannot measure. And this is very true also here in our context. Basically, you do need to have data to compare the effectiveness of alternatives if we talk about, different schemes to improve sustainability, how do know that they are working, how do we know"

We want to enable control loops a lot of these items, are based on observing, of course, what is happening and improving from there. And, so the foundation of recurrent here is to provide the data that can be used to observe, assess, codify the impact. And these are happens also to be an area which, which we believe is actually very actionable in IITF. Next one, please. So and there are really actually 3 aspects that come into this. So first of all, we need to define we need to decide what other metrics that really matter that we need to do for these assessments and comparisons and control loops and so forth. Once we have defined the metrics, We can discuss about how we how should we represent them, how should we organize them, help shall restructure them. How do we relate them to different entities in the network? And once we have the data models, then basically is, question how do we implement this? How do we instrument our networks to provide us this data? Next slide, please. And, yeah, so regarding metrics. So there's some some work that is basically beginning or that basically getting into progress, roughly speaking, basically, this divides into 4 areas of metrics, the metrics at the physical level, those are perhaps the ones which are more immediately actionable. This is basically next slide, please. This basically is a natural starting point of to think about Pfizer, what do we do at the, at the equipment, at the device level? What's the energy that is consumed there and so forth. But of course, we are also interested in the outcome as a whole for the network, overall we need to look also at, how do we, how do we aggregate this across the network because the individual device is only one small part of the equation. And then, of course, beyond the"

Can we do, for instance, assess or attribute, some carbon individual data flows, are there some paths which are more efficient than others and so forth. Those are perhaps more advanced and more speculative topics. Next slide, please. When we talk about the metrics, the first thing that comes to mind, again, at the equipment level is to think about energy and energy utilization. And here, you would have basically the Yeah. What we would what we would expect afterwards this, aspects such as what the power consumption, how perhaps at Granite level. Also, the Pachessi line card, part basis and so forth, But, of course, one of the things, to realize is that, well, energy is something that we can power, something that we can easily measure. But ultimately, we are also a force about greenhouse gas emissions. And while they are related, They are not the same. So we do need to also account for sources and other context and the conversion factors. And here, I would actually turn it over to Marisol Thank you. Now I might need help. This is the challenge. To be a smaller. If we can have next slide. Yeah. As Alex was mentioned, there is a lot things to consider and we needed a big baseline. When we were thinking about because possible drafts to present here. We were thinking to start from that baseline to look at the device because we to look at the not just the device as a network device as well as an application. That could the, translated that application or or device, we could see how much power consumption and an extension to sustainability"

And with the I want to bring that practical point of view, from the equipment that we have been working for the for for some time now in in our company and also with with customers. But, one of these, metrics that we are looking at, and I think is the basic for sustainability is a translation from energy And, here, there are concepts about position as accuracy. Because, we could think that measuring power on the device might be easy. It's not that easy. It's not obvious. And there are a lot of factors that impact on that precision or accuracy of the measure. But when we go to translate to CO2 equivalent, there are more factors And there is that this waiting values that we have to consider and we have to realize as well. There is a, an emission factor depending on the location, what we do by default is going to this, you know, if the people might be aware about the electricity map, but there is, based on the location, that, a mission factor that you need to multiply to translate energy consumption against CO2 equivalent. There are other factors like, the power factor that is more aligned to energy consumption, there is this life lifetime of the device. So when looking At Greenhouse gas emissions, a there is a scope 3 category 11 that is looking today use of the sole products. Here, there's, one attribute that that looks at the lifetime and there is an assumption that many vendors are looking vendors or users are looking at the 5 years as lifetime and all these reports are based on this, assumption that sometimes is a hard to understand, if we take the big number out of it, time of the day, it might be meaningful right hand season."

We can go to the next slide here is, a detailed data model we have been proposing the power wave, data model we will not go into the details here. There is work ongoing in the inventory working group in the IV working group where we plan to extend that's to augment that model and to consume from that work as well, we want to introduce a concept of energy efficiency and we relate to the traffic going through the network equipment or even, the application that might rely on energy consumption. And, we define as well and some metrics as a Alex was pointing out, we it is with the module of power derived And, in here, if we go to the next slide, I can talk a bit about that. We are defining basically these 4 metrics is a, the energy consumption of the device that the might be translated from the power draw, Right?

And, we know they're there are a lot of challenges still about the finance and some some prior work as well that is there, and we need to consider within, looking into this challenges. One of the main problems that we have, is about it how to compute sorry, how to consume and from where to consume those data. Today, you know, for new equipment, there is a lot of considerations around power because it's a topic that is uh-uh currently really active, but we have to think about all the legacy pro we have to think that we only not having half in ICT network equipment, but as well compute and storage. Information that might not be aligned with, a good semantic of definition of, what we need to to measure at the end.

And with this, we are proposing this standardization might not be at the device level might not be at the collector level. Might be one higher level at the aggregation or even at the process or but we need to consume from different data sources some of them will be easy to consume because they are well aligned with what we consider to be telemetry, but some of them will not if we can vote for this slot. Simplarity is one of those aspects that are adding to energy management and are composing this concept about sustainability, is not only about recycling, repurposed products, you know, the 3 hours or 5 hours, but it's also about the materials. There is A lot of lack of information about which is the components of the materials that are building our network equipment. And, this is something that is changing today we will have more tracking, more visibility because this is coming today on the regulations as well. Packaging, how we move the equipment to the customer, or to the, operator how do we transport all that information comes into the concept of similarity.

And I have been listening here a few of the use cases accuracy of the measurements we have been covering there are a lot of tools about the simulation. Right? And it's the first thing and in the organization of a sale are looking to propose new hardware that might be more simpler by it might be less problematic for the environment. But at the end, if we want to optimize those use cases that are at the higher level on the traffic transport, we will need to have real time monitoring as well in their safe. If you want my club, you can find when I raise this? I'll take it this this way. Oh, thank you. Okay. So, yeah, just to, also again, up level. So, but after the, all the things that we need to do at the device level, equipment level, and thoughts. I we just wanted to mention that there are other aspects cells in the metric space consider. Basically, things that happen, I'm also at the traffic level. So for instance, we can also look at flows, but we want to relate functions or attribute, the carbon footprint to what is the contribution of individual service instances of individual flows and so forth. So that doesn't makes, in part, the function of the volume of traffic, the duration of traffic that is taking place and, and so forth.

Yeah, perhaps not as trivial as some others might initially, initially seen. Then, at the level of paths, there is, a bunch of research actually concerning pollution over networking where you have instance where your route or take certain paths depending on the pollutions, whether it's expected be associated with, individual paths. Again, for this enable this type of things we need to have, again, metrics and that allow us to assess the carbon incentives, intensity of those power and the route alternatives, and for instance, look at carbon ratings of the different hops that are expected along the path and so forth. And then finally, again, to mention also well, all the individual there are lots of individual things that we can, count, if you will, but at the end, what really counts is, of course, what is happening at the network at larger, the big picture. And again, this is not as easy as simply adding up all the devices, but there are also the other aspects, my solo mentioned this in in part as well, right there. The aspects felt many insert many devices in the network may not even be instrumented. Is the building cost, the the ventilation, heating, and so forth, all those as that that play into that aspect as well, but that's ultimately where we will have the, measure the impact. Next one. So, And so there have been a number of, discussions also on my tricks also on the e impact mailer and so forth. And, there have been actually a number of controversys. I mean, we don't think, and, some of the things that I think we need to also debate more as a as a community from here. So, one question that has, come up repeatedly response and do traffic level metrics. Matter, or should we just confine ourselves to seeing what it"

There's also another aspect of factors into this that which is the fact that the lower hardware basically has energy consumption, which is nonlinear basically means that your consume was that the idle power is very close the power that you draw at max capacity. And from this, of course, you can concluded. Actually, it it really doesn't matter. The contribution individual flows and and so forth. And also, of course, traffic volume intern is also subject to many trade offs itself. So at points, you might have you might choose to have an efficient encoding to reduce your your volume updated that you need to transmit but then you incur additional cost in encoding, decoding, and so on the compute side and whether or not, you come out as a positive as one of those one of the many questions. So, basically, our stance on this is basically that clearly, the the verdict is still outstanding, but and more research is deleted, but certainly it does not hurt to provide such metrics and therefore, obviously, it is worth my goal to enable them. Another aspect concerns, again, the the the the the fact of what we can actually measure directly versus how we discount or convert things using formula conversion factors and spot. As mentioned, busy, we can most directly instrument, the power consumption, and so forth, not so much the greenhouse gas, equivalents. And whenever we choose formulas, sustainability factors and so forth, that also potentially in, inaccurate inaccuracies that we introduce, And also those factors can also be used to gain the outcomes. Right? I mean, clearly different different players may have different interests in representing how friendly or not or not they are. So clearly, basically, one conclusion for us has been that these factors do need to be clearly documented and broken out so that it's very clear what is the assumption, what is the direct measurement so forth."

That, one aspect is, well, we can measure the cost the energy cost, the environmental cost of doing something, But of course, the question is also what utility is being derived from that, and we need to put this into relation with each other. So, really, it's also about efficiency And, one of the questions is, of course, yeah, what is, how do we measure this utility? So basically the obvious one is traffic volume that is being supported. But that may not always be, accurate and has some issues in itself. And, so our stands on this is, clearly, 1st of all, it is important to be able to put the input related to the amount of output or the utility that is being derived, And however, any one metric, this is I guess, upshot from those discussion is campaign to distorted picture by self and can also be gained. So therefore, basically, we need to have actually a multitude of, of metrics so that the, how to seek picture emerges. Next one. Mean, this is the final, final slide here. There are, of course, many open issues. I think alluded to this in the presentation here. So, So clearly, I, clearly, there is a need to define data data models and metrics. It's difficult to do this even at the device level, even more challenging to go beyond the device level. One particular challenge is, of course, and this again, where the role of standardization comes in in IETF is that to increase the value. We really want these things to be consistently applied and broadly supported across the board because only then can we draw the right conclusions? Second aspect, again, is energy consume does not equal greenhouse gas emissions. Whole aspect about conversion, conversion factors a third aspect concerns that, dealing with imprecision and uncertainty"

Other certain cases where it may make sense, may make better sense to specify a range for and opposed to an absolute value Again, these are some, perhaps, detailed technical issues, but to, but to mention here, did mention the measuring of utility derived, derived for efficiency measures, basic traffic volume is the obvious one in use today. It's controversial to some people. All the fashion is, all the challenges. Can we define something better here? And then finally, some us other aspects to think about is, once do instrument everything. And so both, the question is how do we know that the data produced. Is it being true? Is it, is it actually true? So how can we make sure that basically what has been the the instrumentation implies with the definitions, do we need certification and so forth? And then finally, also, we need to also bring the legacy equipment, which is a huge part of the net as you also into, into the fray And I think that basically is, I I think we have, I live 2:2 minutes for for comments and questions.

So Warren Kumari, I suspect I'm not gonna word this well, and might not be a popular view. But I think it would be nice if everybody wanted to reduce their CO2. Think that would be a great thing. I suspect what might make this go a lot better is if you help operators understand where they're actually spending their energy and then make it so that you can reduce that So their energy costs are lower, and that happens to result in, you know, lower CO2, etcetera. But I think if you try and sell this primarily as, you know, emissions and compliance, you're gonna have a lot harder time getting it actually picked up and deployed. Right? Provide operators a thing showing this is the financial incentive for you to do this. And they'll deploy it faster. I assume And this one will respond actually clearly, I I think, actually, if you can map things to the also the utility dollars actually things get very simple, but that is the challenge that you cannot always necessarily do I can add that, this is one of the first questions that we are seen currently for a few No. One year at least that I'm more active from the the visibility, right, the monitoring of the current infrastructure needs to be there. Mallory Notle. So having direct experience with, you know, measuring and trying to create data, Sort of just questioning your premise. You can't fix what you can't measure. In, a bit of irony. This actually costs a lot of computing and a lot of space and a lot of storage. So I think if we're gonna be talking about massive amounts of measurement, we need to also come up with samples for how to reduce the actual cost of that measurement, not just for this work,"

I I actually have a lot of thoughts here. I have so many that I've realized that I'm gonna write a draft. About them. The The two things that I would add to open issues here are one that in this entire space, the entity that you're measuring is almost the most important selection that you have. Right? Like, you can look at total emissions over life time and say that electric cars are either the best or the worst thing ever to happen in the environment. Both of which are true depending on where you draw the boxes. I think that something that's missing here completely. Is a way to express in a standardized way the entity under test. Right? Like, so you have the thing. You bind it to a yang model. It's attached to a router. Am I actually in that measurement considering endpoint emissions because I I probably should if it's a compute intensive thing. It's very, very tempting to say that we're talking about utility for byte. But the actual utility of a bite is wildly while the like, it's It's it's levels of physics, orders of magnitude different. Right? So it's like and then you're in the multiply a gigantic number by a tiny number, and you get any number you want. So I think there is a Like, the rest of this comment is actually an internet draft, and I'm gonna try and get it out this week. But there is the the biggest thing that I see missing here is where are we scoping this because if there's not understanding about that, then I don't see that how this resolves to something that has a useful impact on the world in Alira Azaki. It's been said in a different ways, I think, but I want to reiterate that we have to ensure that it is clear where we are going to use these metrics."

But associating costs with, the environment or the CO2 carbon footprint is a bit misguided because after the cost pressure goes, what do we do? Energy, renewable energy increases, use increases, energy cost drop. What do we do? The next thing is materials coming. We have to have a holistic view and focus on Thank you. I can only comment on the first one. Right? We are not defining new way of looking at the telemetry, but we have 3 big blocks when we look at the, you know, that we have been putting in sustainability inside. Is the dynamic telemetry that is what is coming on a real time from devices or from entities that we need to monitor. There's a this static telemetry that doesn't change. It comes from the manufacturer. There is another context about the that might be metadata that are within that solution, within that use case. Right? And I think all this is is well So Yeah.

You know, this group's role, I think, is mainly supposed to be around coordination and out where the work should go. So I guess that the question I have is which bits of this, ready to move into standardization? And where. And which bits of research. Yeah. I think, Colin, we can take this up, like, a little bit more detail, but that's kind of the goal of this, like, open questions is to figure out, like, what is ready to go to working groups. And how do we coordinate between them? Because, like, right now, the landscape looks like 10 IETF groups with different things. Right? So we kind of wanna be a place where we can look at this thing holistically. Right? Probably to also spin off, like, a search bug if that's something we see. Absolutely.

So very briefly, I so I I, I, I, I like agree with all the comments and it's, like, really a great work and just an observation that we did, for example, the shake working group, we apply the compression and when we really boil down to the specific details optimizations, but what we can get is like, some devices that are the water meters can you can divide the energy consumption of the water meters by half in some radio conditions. So it gets really interesting, and these are devices that generate very low traffic So I think that there is actually an interplay between end devices and and the network.

The first thing they have done is to see what others have already achieved. And, in sustainability. It's really complex There are a lot of parameters. One thing doesn't look like the other so applicability in different scopes and domains is challenging. However, I just wanted to give you a view of a European funded project, called hexa X Two.

Now in this slide, we listed 5, standards what I tut called recommendations. Why they matter is they provide a global picture. We have been talking about metrics we have talked about, how to use them, what they are these recommendations are painting, let's say generalize view, of what sustainability means in the ICT world and how you can make an impact and how you can measure that impact Now in the first one, the L1410, it is about what we call the life cycle assessments."

The next is 3gpp. Of course, 3gpp is focusing on mobile networks, but they are also realizing that they need metrics and they need solutions and they are moving on those let's say perspectives. In 3 GPP, there are the rung and then there are the systems groups. 1 of the systems group is essay 5. It's roughly, we can say looking at network management issues, where a lot of, us also focus And they are looking at also KPIs Measurement metrics, the run groups are more into implementation. How can they using those metrics reduced, environmental impact and essay 1 is on requirements management. For the next releases of mobile technology. And they are really keen on, let's say creating metrics and also exposure of those metrics."

We can maybe take 1 or 2 quick questions that people have. Right. So if there's no questions, we can move to the next one. And I don't I don't know what's working Hi, Ronald. Yes. Hi. I'm Otaddie Broadcom. Ivy speak as, I work in ITU. Thank you very much for your presentation. Just to explain two things, beyond this aspect of sustainability there is another initiative that was taken by ISO. ISO, is working to make the SDGs sort of by design in their standouts. That's quite a lot for work. So it's not just about energy. So broader issue. We tried with Japan. I tried with Japan to do the same in, attisaaglevel in the previous study period. We failed because of all the complications. I mean, we cannot come back on that. But just to let you know that there is a little bit of a broader attempts to, more systematically engage, sustainability in in the ATU as well. The difficult team we got is that, there is simply a lack of training from the people, from the members. People are very much not aware of all of that. And the issue we realized is not only what's you can do when you write a standard for helping summarization or sustainability But the other issue is what are the indirect effects, the side effects you don't see? So"

And please send some pointers to the list if you can. About the work in ISO. Okay. Alright, Ali. You can speak about the other topic you had. So this is, 1 of the lightning talks, infrastructure sharing. For sustainability. When we talk about sustainability as we have seen in the impact list as well. On one site, We have locations that are covered with multiple operators, with parallel infrastructure serving customers. They are running into investments bottlenecks. To grow their networks. On the other hand, we have by different accounts 1 third of the world population that is not served or that is not served. In an empowering way they can change their lives. So In these two aspects, can infrastructure sharing provide and mitigation. Can we come to a solution with infrastructure sharing? As this is a lightning tool, I don't have time to explain the whole thing, but infrastructure sharing is Can we serve a area population, users, with a single network infrastructure, on top of which operators can differentiate based and services. Now"

Because we want to be or a disaster situation. Would infrastructure sharing Rob as of our resilience. Then the other question is is would we trust, in shared infrastructure? In terms of, performance, in terms of capacity, as if I am an operator, would I want to use a shared infrastructure rather than my own? So do we have the tools to monitor, for resources, performance, how these are used And can we dynamically manage this according to the needs of the operator. Then there is the question. Of course, some level of infrastructure sharing is happening. There is the passive neutral hosts today. The towers, the data center infrastructure we can all use. But if we move into the active infrastructure sharing where Where does it make sense to do this? In the access, mobile access or fixed access or in transport core, or can we do it end to end? How do we implement this? Then our IETF protocols adapt it to solution like this. We, we have, of course, different, tunneling technologies. We have different management technologies. But is it sufficient or would we need the orchestration layer? On top of, what is already there."

Would infrastructure sharing increase or decrease decentralization or centralization. And then how do we manage that? Next slide, please. This. So, basically, infrastructure sharing is doing more with less. And this is a fundamental principle of sustainability And can we address it? At IETF. Infrastructure sharing, is not, let's say, running away from competition. It is a collaboration. It's infrastructure layer. But differentiation and competition in upper layers. So it really requires innovation at every level. And essentially, it has the potential to help connect the unconnected today. But also enable different business models like automated driving, we cannot populate all the roads in the world with the multiple networks. For example, And Also, we are aware, especially in sustainability that it's all about trade offs, and optimizations. One parameter against another or many against each other. So we would implement infrastructure where it would make sense. Thank you very much. Thank you. If there's one quick question, we can take that. Hello, Luis from Telefonica. A renewal, we were referring, to operators and so, but, also, we need have in mind that this is not only a problem for operators, but also content providers.

May I ask my question or no? Yes. Did you have a question? Yes. Go ahead, but briefly, please. It's it's a command. It's very quick. On the previous, speaker, the last slide One issue we have actually is that 30 years ago, we had basically only 1 property which was is my design performing? Then we started to ask capability. Then we had manageability, then security, then and so on. So now we are adding a bunch offer the criteria on sustainability. Issue is that we have no tool to understand how if our designs are okay and to understand where are the right trade offs. If we were in civil Engineering, we have to have to do that for a breach. Emerging all the constraints and conflicts you have is all the characteristics there. We could use simulation tools because we have a composition theory called physics. But we don't have here And big issue I see in what you're trying to do is I've seen nobody or very little done on where are the architect tools, where we can take all of these characteristics on a design and put the design in place and start to simulate and and do optimization there. There are people in energy savings for buildings they produce when they have to optimizer building energy, the energy of a building they produce thousands of architectures, They send it to a big cloud where the optimizer of that on their specific aggregation methods, and they come back with their customers. Sorry. We're kind of short of time in this session. So perhaps you could post more, of this question on the list. Thank you, just to say we are missing the tool. Yeah."

    "text": "Lewis. Everybody, I I represent here an initial work in for defining an API in order to retrieve the energy that could be associated to to a path to another path. This could be one of the metrics that Alex and and Manuel presented before. And, we'll just for, for your reference, this, draft was presented in Panergy this week, yesterday, basically. So the motivation is to provide about the energy consumption in a path. So, between an original destination idea will be to retrieve what is the energy that could be associated to to a given path or even to, a volume, a traffic volume for a customer or something like that. So, they they used to define an API using well known architecture resourceful API and the schema is like a open API. And the the objective will be to, expose this information to a customer customers for one of the the cases that we were considering was to these to SD WAN customers for instance if we want to, provide to them, a view of energy consumption that they can for the, or their own sustainability purposes. Or even being used internally in order to to do optimization processes in, in the perimeter side. So consolidation of traffic and, and so so please with the peak and belly moments of the traffic along the day. Next, please. So the the rationale that we follow, we are taking in in 2 iteration these 2 assumptions. The first assumption is that the energy consumption in the devices a baseline component, which is independent of the traffic. This was recommended by by Alex, but there is another component that is dependent on the traffic. We are based, this assumption of the paper that you you can see that the the references. And, essentially, the the bay the baseline component of this energy consumption would be associated to the chassis, to the processors, the funds, and so on so far. And then we have the the other, amount of energy consumption. Into the traffic volume in the reference of the paper more or less the"

But, for this, we have taken assumption too that is due to this in any cities like these ones and so. We expect in the future to have mechanisms for, for reducing the such a baseline component. So by means of of cars or going to a sleep mode and, and so on and so forth. So finding ways of a of a impacting on that baseline component that probably nobody's it's not the case, but we expect to end the future to be the case. Next, please. So going to, to the API itself So the idea will be to offer this API through our network front end. This could be a network controller or any other management system that can collect and aggregate this information of, being consuming in the network. And as you can see, the the the the the idea that we're, we take is, okay, we, between origin and destination, we will have different potential parts. These potential parts will have different energy conclusion because of the number of hoax, because of that apology, they are detector, the models of the routers, the, bit rate of the transceivers and so on so forth. So they'll be able to characterize the potential of the possible alternatives and and and without trying to do some optimization in some case, or once we have placed the the flow in the network, dispose the actual consumption, to to the customer to the external part. For now, in the implementation of we are considering the the value of the energy reported by the the transceivers and, but could be complemented with, the the Chassis and Soul. So, as we saw this morning, somehow we need to refinance it, but the idea would be this metric and to use this metric for, those purposes. Next, please. Yep. And this is an initial work.

There are no slides for the stock. Soul just pay closer attention. So you saw some slides, that's nice. I'll show you some sort of framework. So I posted of a proposal for how to collect and aggregate telemetry information. And I'll be presenting that in that bot in this room in a in a bit And I don't wanna share the detailed levels of that in here. But I was wanted to try on you. I thought about some principles for how this collection and aggregation of telemetry data for power and sustaining whether they should work and see if you agree or not. So, and I should also the first thing in disclaimer I've been working with elementary for a few weeks or something like that. And then I know that many in this room had done more decades of this of this work than I have. So than I have done weeks. So forgive my imposter, stands here. So the first, observation I make when it comes to collecting data from, the network from devices is that Okay. If we are designing, like, new yang models or new APIs for how to collect this It's gonna take 10 years, until it's inside the devices in the network. It takes 5 years to standardize and 5 years to get it out in the field. Right? We don't have that. Okay? So let's we have to assume that we use the interface that already exists today's devices. Then of course, we need to do execute, we need to have metadata and better understanding of what we are beating, but that has to come not from the devices themselves necessarily, but to be added on the next player on the collection software that we were needing to write. We can do that."

So if a device is more than a new and they wanna wants to help with this metadata, they can have a catalog that's points that you can read this and this and this. And here's the exact units that This includes schooling and this does not so that we know what we're actually measuring. I think we should be using Yang to describe all the data that we're measuring Some devices out in the network, they are yang capable. And have good yak molds already, and that's cool for them. But much of the equipment that we have, let's say, including this CPU racks and the cooling systems might not have animals today. So the responsibility for us is then to add that Yang description for these devices so that we have good detailed everything And, in the in the Yang world, there's many things being rendered automatic and there's lots of tools around this So I think if we standardize around using Yang to describe this, I think that would be a good a lot of people are using time series databases, As the sort of endpoint where this all is information, both the low level metrics, also all the aggregate that we derived and intelligence levels that come to they also, in times, use databases in that cases. So we need a mapping from the Jang models that describes both the the the low level metrics, but also the intermediate help level things. So that they it's direct you can directly see how things are being mapped from devices and from intermediate levels and top level insights into these times there's databases. There's a tracking So, transparency, really. If you have some reading somewhere, you should be able to see where it is coming from exactly. Is missing squarely today in all the projects I have seen."

Not so much on the detail levels because devices have what they have. But on the intermediate levels, how do you aggregate this? How do you combine things? Because if we combine an aggregate in one way and another company does a different way, it would be an apple orange is comprised. And my final point is that Okay. If we are designing these ways of how we aggregate and, how we defining what things are being measured. Pretty good time, but we have this discussion on the mailing list. About idle power. Who is responsible for this Abel power of all this equipment. Should we double it out to all the customers that use work, or should the the operator to save the responsible for this. And I think we should bring in the economies for that. There are, Then SPTI, the science based targets initiative, you have the greenhouse gas protocols teams, that are already doing the evaluations of our companies in a world operators and equipment manufacturers and giving them targets what to reduce and so on. They are used to these sort of questions, and they know how to construct an economic framework that gives the right incentives to everyone.

So a lot of folks should be talking about energy, energy consumption, and then the pollution that comes with the waste from energy, but as we know, because I think Vessna's, her presentation during the E Impact workshop. Marisol also mentioned this in her slide very briefly, there are impacts that don't have anything to do with energy. Those are minerals, natural resources, Ewaste in general. So, I think It's worth trying to, comprehensively, but briefly elaborate all of those impacts at least once so that that can point to future work.

Brilliant. Oh my gosh. Thank you both so much. So so the idea being they can be categorized in different ways that can be bulleted in different ways. Again, the attempt is to be brief in describing what they are but to be thorough. So things like land use. There's a finite amount of it. Data centers increasingly take up a lot of it. There's also environmental impacts on those buildings being in certain places. They have to be in certain places that can't be in other places that creates scarcity, that creates ecosystem issues. You know, even, even land, we could extend the seabed that, there's disruptive, impacts for cables being in certain places, on the bed of the seat. Or, you know, just to again, like, you can see how these kind of bleed in point one another mineral extraction happening on the seabed mineral extraction happening on the So the earth, use of water for cooling, for mineral extraction processes, It both limits use for humans, And it also, for animals and other ecosystems and it also, is is very, expensive. I include in this, and this is maybe controversial take, use of electromagnetic spectrum as being a finite resource, that has to be allocated. Typically, there's, I mean, even in the ITU, there's treaty around how that gets allocated first the majority worlds in the, sort of global south countries as it were before it gets allocated to developing countries.

There's pollution from fossil fuels, obviously, which is a carbon issue. But there's also the burning of e waste because often plastic often it has the the minerals once they start breaking the the the natural minerals that have been used and extracted, then start breaking down, and that can have effects in terms of sanitation, in terms of landfill space, another finite source, pollution of the soil, etcetera.
