I see every presentation late later to discuss this. is that you may end up with a break in the time between the installation of know the source address validation and enforcement versus the forwarding changes.

There is some, I believe, material in the requirements that talk about the issue of convergence. I don't believe it it is clear enough with regard to the issue you're raising.

I'm pretty sure that one of the major problems of the definite domain is that, yes, there are clear black and white cases, But, actually, avoiding doing damage to the gray area, which quite certainly is around here. at least, for example, in the case that convergence is happening. I think I think is is very important, and I guess just saying, negative or positive or well okay. fails negative fails positive probably is not sufficient to chart the space. Okay.

But I think the more important point that he was making, you can correct me if I miss misunderstood you, Jeff, is that there's like to depending on the semantics of that information and how it relates to the forwarding database. there's likely to be race conditions that we can introduce if they converge at different pace is relative to one another. and we need to try and make sure that whatever we're designing is Erring on the side of I don't I can't remember which way around the terminal she wants. But incorrectly allowing traffic to continue flowing during That's intoprotocol convergence gap as opposed to transiently dropping it on the floor and causing black holes to open. And before we even get to which way we are, make sure we agree on how we wanted to air and that our protocol behavior exhibits what we want. with regards to the convergence and race conditions. Yeah. Exactly. working group could pick a different answer but we better be deliberate about it, not accidental. Absolutely. And I think it's important. I don't think that we wanna box ourself into a design that requires a tight coupling between those two processes. and we need to live with a we need to accept that we live in a world where there is going to be transient mismatch between those 2 sets of state. and we need to make sure that we don't do something harmful while it's true. speaking personally, I strongly agree with you.

It may include the real forwarding path information from other ESAs which consists of their large image source prefixes and the corresponding incoming interfaces. The other kind of information is general information. it refers to the information that is not designed for self. but can also be used for sale to some extent. such as routing information in ribs and fibs. the relationships between prefixes and AS numbers in RPKI, raw objects, and the customer to provider uniseyshapes in RPTI as far objects.

What Saab needs to propagate is information about what Sources may appear where. I wouldn't think SAV would be forwarding Forwarding path information, that's what routing protocols do. That's which way do you go to reach a destination, which is the us it in the the point that has been made multiple times in the course of this work is The whole point is that they are not interchangeable. Did you really mean that you want the SaaS specific protocol to be obtaining forwarding path information or to be propagating source location information?

We should make sure this is what we're proposing is very clear in the architecture so that the working group can decide how to make the choices about it. Yeah. Here is an example This is a scenario this is a limited prefix propagation scenario called by new export, this scenario has been described in the interdominant problem statement draft. So in this case, when a s 1 and a s 4 deploy self and AS 4 will improperly block the legitimate traffic originated from AS1. So but in this example, I also have to use the self specific message can make the accurate staff Assume ES 1 selects AS1 to AS2 to s 4 as the best forwarding path to prefix p 4 So a s 1 and a s 4 can communicate this kind of information. So by using the self specific protocol, AS 1, the diabetize is forwarding path information in South Pacific messages.

The data model is designed by referring to the separate function defined in the related draft of architecture. under the south table. And this data model haven't detached any content. of the protocol extension. And maybe the model of them will augment this basic data model. The model includes 3 part, some led configuration stage and event notification. Next slide, please. In this 0 conversion of the dress, The data model is designed based on implementation experience and young rules. therapy version is a initial version, and, of course, not a fellow version it will be updated or continuous according to your comments and the the implementations. The document is added in compliance with the young rules defined in IFC 8407. Next, please. I will note that When the working group adopts this, we may well make non backwards compatible changes or radical changes. And even when we get information models, for various pieces we may need to make significant changes. So we are not bound because this is not done yet. by the young rules about what kinds of changes one can make, we do want to maintain that it is compliant and proper yang, however. Okay. This it's the primarily building block of separated young. There are sub table and sub rule. we have a brief recall. A staff table is constituted by a list of sub rules and the ETC rule is a pair of source prefix and the valid income interface. Now something looks"

So a design of the sublet young model make a deep reference to FC 8349, which is the base to young adult for Greg and the routine manager. Next, please. end up. in the whole view of the operation, to enable a separate file chip on a router. our managed open play, there are works from 3 aspect. The first one is the technical configuration management. to configuring the running parameters for satellite function. And the second one is about the self entry management. It will focus on the static server rule configuration. and the direct only state of each sample collection. and the last one is also a typical event management for satellite function. the LMS and the router could communicate such returns of information through the w letter yang. And next, please, accordingly, in the tree diagram, of stuff that young. The configuration part contain 2 things Why is satellite global or interface configuration. And the another one is the about the static assembly rules configuration. And in the state part, it also includes the sub cable information under the subinterface information. In the event part, it defines some node fication about the satellite function. On the right side, it is just children needs a summary for this 5 kind of information. And we we are go to the detail of each one one by one. And then next, Okay. The first one is about the sublet general configuration."

The young model could control the sub layer function enable a digital moment. And it also could set in the parameters for sub mode, sub table capacity, subinterface source priorities, and so on. And in interface configuration level, it also could control for the sublight function on this specific interface. and the 13th sub mode resecting some statistics for this interface. under the next, please. This is about the will establish configuration. The young model put support to add delete or update each self rule at risk by searching the value of source prefix and the incoming interface for both wafer and receive sound rules. it also could set the capacity of a sub table under the app limitation of 4 and basic some rules. And the next this is the read only notes for the set some table state. It could collect all sub rules of before Adabasics' family. it also could just to catch the fact that some rules had This specific is also prefix. And for each sub rule, the static information or the packet count information could be carrier at the same time. Next, please. and this is the young nose for the interface statement of sublight. the substhetics under the sub packet contrast for each interface. could be recorded under report. For example, the self complex of valid invalid or drop a packet by executing the sublet function."

Here is the overview about the satellite young models. the data structure of all the nodes in the trigger room mentioned buff are defined in the 3 models. as shown in the dark room, debt already. The first one of the 3 model is named IETF South, it is a bicycle or general component for the subnet your module. And then the second one is reinforce up if to define the data structure for the additional data space fit to before SaaS. And according to the basic stuff, define the additional data specific to basic stuff. And This model, it is connected to the augment by art some related functions, these models in the future accordingly. I mean, next please, At last, it's example, about how to configuring the static server rules. through the mentioned young models above. And I will escape the details. Briefly, it just to download and setting the value of source prefix and incumbent interface for for the each sample on a. the next place,"

For each sub rule, it accepted us perfect and incoming in the face. also list the information of pecky to calls. of sublet And the next, please. Okay. And lastly, it's about consideration of next step. according to the following updates of satellite architect draft, may be there more sub rules from other types of control plane from telco. will be supported by the young model As we start the young design earlier. So it will of purchasing if it could have more design from anyone interested with this, and any comments from you or co designing our welcome Okay. That's all sense. and commerce, nobody's on the list. Nobody's walking to the microphone. I guess there are no comments at this time. I think given the the relationship between the work, this is it's very early for figuring out the structure of the Yang, but thank you for starting to work on it so that we have a place to record things as we work our way forward. With that, I'll give you Almost 10 minutes of your life back. Thank you, guys. It yeah. Hi. This is Ben Schwartz from from Meta. just wanted to I mentioned that there's that that I've been shopping a proposal, that's traceable to this work"

But, also, it looks like we'll have a mailing list that. That proposal is about data plane, protections that are cryptographically based, so really a very radically different approach from this. But if anybody's interested, please come talk to me. Thank you. So right off. in"
