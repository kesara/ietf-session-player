So If you're in the wrong room, that was a good time to on the right room. If not marco. So again, you can see the charter mailing this details, a link to a wiki for the research group? And the details of the media. And some border place. The no, the Is in place. Essentially, you have to abide by that. I hope at this point in the week, you all have heard seen and heard about that enough times. So I'll just let you your eyeballs are gonna to make out the small font there."

If you're in the meeting mid room are the remote are present these to all the muting of microphones and that kind of thing? For people are... Hopefully people will be jumping to the microphone remotely or in in the room? If you're doing that, please join the Mid queue before you go to the microphone. We don't need to be super hyper strict about it, but it's kinda useful. And mostly just to be sure we're being fair to the most attendees. And lastly at this meeting in the, we have the asking see. So if you're not wearing a mask, please find one and donna if you can. If that's not possible, then it's probably better to leave the room to adhere to the policies. So everybody seems to be well behaved and mass terms. That's good. And so for presenters, the know, presenters and remove their mask if they wish was presenting. Otherwise, please do keep it on. Okay. So here's our agenda. We're at agenda bus parts, today's agenda is kind of a little bit because it's the first meeting, it some introductory material. There's kind of a a slight waiting towards people we knew could do stuff easily and quickly in had done stuff already. So hopefully, in future meetings, we'll have more diverse diverse kind of inputs as as the word kind of progresses that would be good. But basically, we have that.

So we have some from Jonathan. Some current work in progress that's ongoing in the space. Then we wanna have a kind open discussion about what people are interested in doing, etcetera. And hopefully, that is most of the the interesting part of the agenda, the the talks I think are more kind of background for this for this a meeting. And I say, if if our remote speaker doesn't land and if needed, Jonathan has a backup. Is great. Okay. So again, welcome. This is the first meeting. We're a proposed Ir f research group. Which kinda means that if we if we behave well and seem to get of thumb, then we turn into a real Ir f research group and a year ish. I think that's the general kind of mode around. If we are totally ineffective or sq too much we would probably just disappear. Don't say that likely, but you never know. Again, for a whole bunch of people you will realize the I r f is the internet research task force. Is not the Etf for instance of engineering task force. And would say a little bit more about that. But one good thing is don't say working with by accident too much. Again, we kind of prosper our flounder based on people doing work or not doing work and finding things interesting. A volunteer kind of thing. So we don't get the force people to do stuff. Post also don't be shy but volunteering are saying I have this thing, I think is useful and interesting. I think it's a research group. So Ir f research group charters are quite malleable and research groups can kind of decide how they want to process things much more flexible than in the.

There's a lot people who are pretty kind of ignorant out that's I be one of those. So we should be tolerant of those kind of differences in background. Sorry. I never said Jonathan. You should say here. Jonathan. I mostly do form methods particularly form analysis. And I'll be talking about that in a few minutes. I'm saving by the way. It's not done. So the one it doesn't know that formal methods. So just from the charter, even though it's, you know, again, it's the research group so the charter is not written in stone particularly. These are the kind of goals that that we're kind of agreed after we had a kind a site meeting mask time and a bunch of discussions around on the list is you know, to to provide a kind of forum to bring together people in the Or working in the It space. And people studying doing formal methods and applying them to share experience and ideas. Also to try and understand the strengths and limitations of these formal methods in the context of stuff that's interesting in the idea. And, you know, to some extent, if people wanna work and saying, here's the thing the Could reuse or has used. That's that's kind of all really good material. We'll say a about that. We don't get to tell them what to do it. Educational material is kinda useful, I think, You know, how do these can you use these kind promo methods? Training, examples, how to use the software. I think all ask kind of stuff might be. And I'm experimenting with methods to say, you know, how would this help the That it's worked on better. So that's the kind of context.

So one of the things one of the classical errors for researchers is turn up the Idea and say you guys are all stupid. Here's you should be doing what I tell you to do because I'm I'm smarter you. And that doesn't generally work too well. We don't be trying to tell the For the bus if people can demonstrate that the use of a certain method produces some better outcomes in some sense whether that the approved security or safety or some other kind of feature that's great. And demonstrating is great and the If they chose to follow And I And mimic what it's been demonstrated here, that would be good to echo. So The other thing is we should kind be aware of... Let's say if somebody is working on applying form a method to a particular protocol. If that work is kind done more in the context of the Working group, sometimes that makes more sense. So one of the things again we to be careful of is you don't have kind of parachute to somebody working group. And say, I you know, I've never spoken to you before, but I've studied your protocol using my formal method And here's here's what you should do. If you have such done work, which could be great. Maybe it's better kind of thinking about that work because being part of the activity of the Working group. That also gets this solicit here. Opposed to do the right round. So we don't have to kind parachute in. But other than not, I think our our our charter should be regard it fairly loosely. What else? There's a wiki and so people have started us. Thanks to those who have to do that. Jonathan you lot. I think chris chris what did so I'm not sure who else a few people have populated And so far that really just has kinda content about.

And when me get to the open discussion, this These are the kind of topics that we figured would be useful let's to talk about, but it's up to you guys as well. So if you have other topics they're more than welcome. So I'll just briefly mentioned these just again to kinda hopefully see some ideas that might come up again in a while after bit president presented. One of the topics that was discussed to be on the list was would it be useful if we had a have a small sample problem that was understandable, a lot of people in the. To which you could then demonstrate how to use different formulas. And say, here. And so again, it does not necessarily have to be something super complicated, like feed feedback or something which are that... Our complicated. If we had a simpler problem that was Relevant. People could use as a way as demonstrated of showing how their methods could be used and hooked kind the results they produce. That might be an interesting thing. We probably need to scope kind of topics that people are actually working on. Based on to the large extent on who wants to do what, One of the topics I think that Jonathan will talk about is usable is in the name of the research group and usable is not probably a thing you would describe a lot of these methods us? No. So can we come narrow app somehow I help to do that. Another thing I Jonathan well, so we'll touch on is oftentimes, researchers can use these mechanisms some methods to say, oh, I found a big problem with your protocol.

Again, a lot if you look at the wiki, and if you look at the work that's been done already various idea. Protocols.

But For now I'm gonna try and for you what we're actually talking about because a lot of this is super abstract out of it painful. Okay. So what is formal analysis?

You have symbolic and you have computational analysis. And both of those represent a protocol call algebra directly. And I'll be able to give you a more concrete picture of that in a few moments. But they from there differ quite dramatically. So a symbolic analysis assumes that crypto primitive is a perfect. We don't try and model exactly how Works. We don't try model how to cubs work. Just say Here is an asymmetric opera of. Here is and Ae e. Computational analysis on the other hand, we'll try and produce a concrete brown. Or try and say this provides of security. And if you make this reduction, you lose why of those bits? And Overall, The key end up differences is a symbolic analysis says, go no go. Is this protocol called secure? Is this protocol Not core? Does this protocol have a deadlock does this for go have a. Whereas a computational analysis, will give you a fuzz answer. It'll say it is secure up to this level of precision. And computational analysis give you a more fine grained answer, but it is harder to apply two big protocols. Obviously, if you look in higher resolution, you can fit less on the screen. So I'm gonna talk a little bit about symbolic analysis. But no that equivalent tool could be given for computational analysis."

And this was a symbolic analysis as I said, and we made a detailed model that captured Very nearly. All the modes, all the features of T one three a single massive model. And we were able to do that during the standardization process. While the standardization process was going on, and we were able to find and fix bugs in the design, before it went to our. And so this sounds like oh, amazing problem solved. Why are we all here? The answer is because it was a really painful process. The proof was very large over seven hundred and fifty thousand lines and it took just to verify the proof took several days on a five hundred gigabyte hundred and twenty eight core ever. Which is a pretty intense amount of hardware to throw any problem. So I don't... Do you want people to jump in with questions as you go or would you rather keep until the end? If people want to bring questions, I'm happy? So so again, just join the queue and jump to the mic if you do. Actually on the on this slide, I'll also know that the third there were two multi day workshops as part of this whole process as well. Yeah. So what... I mean, that were like Oh, wow, I do come better with that musk. There there were several teams who did different analyses and found different things at different times. But Yeah.

Going to show you the attack, and then I'm going to try and show you you can use formal analysis to detect and fix the attack. So this is a very short price call. From the late seventies. It's mostly used these days for demonstrating how use formal analysis. I'm sure it has other uses, but I've never seen one. Turn this parts call Alice sends to bob containing her identity and she encrypt all of that under bob's privately key. Because I didn't want to melt your brains with an entire P description, I'm just gonna assume that everyone knows everyone else's is public Well, sends a message back to alex including Alice notes, bob's nuns. And all of those encrypted on the dialysis public key. And alice them replies the ball saying, here's your notes back encrypted onto your public key. And at the end of this protocol, the goal is that Alice and Bob both know that they're talking to the right person and they have two shared numbers. An a and n. Now obviously, the reason I'm bringing this out is because that's in the attack. If ever I was just gonna say everything's sank dory, this wouldn't be a very interesting slide. So the attack goes something like this. Alice decides to communicate to Ingrid. In ingrid, unbeknownst status is a bad person. And Ingrid has decided that she wants to pretend to be alice to bob. So Alice sends her message Ingrid, Ingrid rein encrypt it with Bob's. Bob them responds to who he thinks is alice? With an a,"

However, what ingrid obviously does is just passes this message back to a, as if it was a reply to the original message. And That means a will end decrypt it and send it back to the Then send it back to Ingrid and Then ingrid now knows Envy. Which allows Ingrid to complete the protocol score with bob. And so at the end of this protocol call, Alice has successfully run the protocol with Ingrid and everything from an perspective is correct. That that has worked perfectly. Yeah, Alice and Ling ingrid have successfully run the protocol. However, bob thinks he's on the post with without. Indeed, Bob has run the price. Within ingrid. And not only has you not run the protocol with alice? He does not have a shared secret without. He has a chat secret with Ingrid. Okay. Turns out that the fix, there are a few fixes, but the the fix proposed by low is very easy you just put bob's identity, in the second message and this all just goes away. So if we just hop back a slide, at step one two three, Four. Sorry. Alice gets a message, it says N n b b and then goes up. Well, I'm not talking to be and both the protocol. Okay. So I I just encrypt the code from Tamarind, this is how you can implement it In tamarind, I did have to tweak the code at little bit just to make the graph that we're gonna see later.

And I gotta say, fresh value and I a public key and a private key. And it outputs the message on one. And outputs it state. Because you need to advance through the state machine of the ini on the responder. Rather show you all the rest of the rules. This is what you get as a pretty picture from the timer Ui. And you get it in three lines, you get inputs on the top. You get the outputs on the bottom. And then the middle you have the actions. This is what you can reason about. And so What what do you mean? By reason about? I mean, literally, we write a lemma That like this. We say, It cannot be somebody claims to have set up a shared secret so has completed the protocol and now has a shared secret between alice and Bob, But the adversary knows it without having performed a long time key review. So This is not exactly what I showed on the previous slide Tamarind doesn't really have a mechanism for representing dishonest actors it just has a mechanism for saying, here is an honest actor who is compromised by the attacker. Which is effectively the same but just the representation.

Is formal analysis is a technique that can be used to prove mathematically speaking, that protocol works as intended. It can be very difficult. But we do have tooling that takes that mech minimizes a lot of the dr. We can get rid of all of this. Copying lines lines aligned to line with a slight change in each line. All of that can be done by computers, they're much better at it than us. And It has been used to find and fixed protocols a bugs protocol call, sorry that we actually care about. I e. One three. And I think that's my last slide. Questions, there go. I have one slide, Chris. So Can you hear me now? Oh, I can. Okay. What's the... I don't know. I think I know the answer this question, but I think something that came to mind. When I was watching a presentation is what's the intuition for why proofs are so big? So So the I think the key intuition is Bridge calls are getting really, really big and really, really complicated. And it's very, very hard to manually inspect them to know that that's secure.

And it found if you like con confuse them in this massive way, it it didn't produce the security guarantee but you down you'd expect. And so I think it's important to realize like, we're building these massive protocols and they're very hard to reason about intuitively.

Initially, this was used to prove things like freedom from deadlock. Or freedom from live lock. And then that's become more and more you prove pretty much any security property you cats write down.

And then people who have an issue with modeling their protocol how someone they can come and talk to experts. I think that's the, like, cheapest like, first step. The second step is can we build a a pool of knowledge. And we say, here is just like a record in one place of everything we know about formal methods. And, like, literally just a big, like, Cool.

I'm presenting here some security analysis, but this is, like pen and paper. The eventual goal I think should be to have like proper machine check proofs, but we're very early on. I'm gonna talk a little bit about the progress so far though. So this is security analysis in support of the P working group here at Etf. This is pro security treatment of verifiable distributed aggregation functions. This is a a class of very lightweight multi party computation protocol and pc. So this is joint work with myself, Philip Sc who's in the room. And Davis and Mike Rose select. And Philip and I are also coa authors of the V dash spec. Which is being developed in the Cfr g. Very sorry about all those acronyms next slide, please. Okay. Just a little bit of context here. So the P working group was chartered last year with the goal of specifying mechanisms mechanisms for securely aggregating privacy sensitive measurements collected from users. So we have lots of use cases in mind, but as just a kind of a high level think like telemetry. You have an operating system, a browser an application you wanna collect performance or maybe threat detection telemetry and you wanna do so without learning to more information than you actually need for your application.

An an inactive research group document The way we're using this in P is via protocol patient called the distributed aggregation protocol, which basically spells out do you execute a V over Http? Next slide, please. So I'm just gonna give a very, very quick introduction to V. So our goal here is we have a bunch of users each with a private measurement and we want to compute some function or of those measurements. And the way we're gonna do this in a way that respects privacy is we're going to distribute the computation amongst a small set of what we call aggregation service first and security going to require that these servers not include, I'll get to a second. So the way this works, we're using something called secret sharing. It's a lot simpler than it sounds. The very basic ideas is, like, imagine you have an integer you split that integer into two parts such that if you only have one part you can't discern any information about the measurement that you split. But we also have this property that we can add up shares across measurements. So what the clients do, they split their measurement into shares, upload these to the aggregation servers And then the each server can then locally aggregate all of its shares into a share of the results. And it sends that to some entity that we call the collector And then the collector gets to combine the aggregate shares from the into the aggregate result. So there is one wrinkle here because we're operating on secret shared data, we need some way of doing input validation without leaking the measurements. And this is kind of where the crypto gets fun and I won't get into the details, but the the... Basically, this requires some amount of"

And in fact, we can para the process of aggregation across all measurements. So we can basically do this interactive step amongst the independently across measurements, let's which lets us scale quite effectively. The downside, of course is that we don't get to to compute any old function. We're restricted to functions that decompose in a particular way. Specifically, and that you might have some, like primitive nonlinear linear operation that you applied to each measurement? And then all you do is take some linear combination of those measurements to get the accurate result. So this is not all of Mpc. That's something I wanna emphasize this is not general purpose. This is not garbled or anything like that. Here the goal here is really just like to get a use full subset of of things that that P working group needs. So this is things like mean, standard deviation. You could even do linear regression. You can do things like you have a bunch of arbitrary strings and you wanna compute the heavy hit that is the number of strings that occur so so so many times you could do that too. Next slide. So I'm gonna skip this for the sake of time, but basically, Da is this kind of wrapper protocol for a v that you gets you to execute it over Http. And we're dealing... This is like where the protocol engineering happens. There's this is... The design of this thing is very important to security. But it's... Yeah. It's sort of a higher level of consideration than what we looked at in the Next slide. So we has basically two security considerations, the first being privacy."

So this is kind of a a like, a a classic Mpc property. And then the other property is robustness. I kind of got it at this before. We need to do input validation. So we need given a set of shares uploaded by a client. We need make sure that when we combine those shares, we actually get a meaningful meaningful value. So we're actually you know, computing something useful in the system. So for privacy, we have a very strong corruption model. The attacker gets to corrupt everybody, including the collector the network, all ag except at least one honest one. For robustness, we see a slightly weaker corruption model we need everybody to... We need the ag to execute the protocol on correctly in order to compute a correct result. Next slide. So our goal for this paper, it's it's linked It's on ep print. You can... It's... The link is at the bottom of these slides. Yes, you can see it. Our goal was basically to formal these see these security considerations and prove security for the current crop of candidate protocols. These by the way are called p three and poplar one, However, like, we needed to... These... These these protocols are by the way, based on papers from the literature, but these papers don't deal with certain details that are become really important when you try to translate it into to a standard.

Well, we had basically a simple design in mind and summer requirements. So da right now is very flexible and how this would work So in our security model, we needed to sort of some model this like maximal flexibility that system allows at least today. So our results we have privacy and robustness for a a slightly modified version of p three, which is now in the new draft. And we also have some security proofs for a a variant of poplar one. So Popular one is is newer like newer crypto not quite settled. And in fact, at Cfr g, there's gonna be a proposal for an alternative to popular one. We had an alternative to popular one in this paper. And that's what we ended up studying. Next slide. Yeah. So I think Following Jonathan talk, I I think I would prepared a slightly different talk.

The attackers is modeling a coalition of corrupt clients who are trying to break the robustness of the system and they're interacting with the honest ag. And they get to basically submit as many m reports as they want. And then observe the ag as they're interacting within with each other. And then... Yeah. And then the winning condition Well, it's it's kind of technical in the general case. But the way to think about it is the attacker is trying to get for some reports, get some ag to accept an invalid share of that report. And... Yeah. And basically lead to the collector computing and incorrect value. Next slide. Yeah. So privacy is then captured also by a game. And... Yeah, there's there's a lot of detail, like, on this like, yeah. I get it. It's there's a lot going on here. But it's it's modeling something pretty pretty whatever I think. I I hope. The game here is played by an attacker that has control of the collector all but one honest, all but one ag and control of the network. And it's it's mounting something we call a chosen batch attack So this is analogous to a chosen plain text attack for those familiar with formal definitions for symmetric encryption or public key encryption."

It provides to this Oracle two measurements m zero and m one, you can see on the the first oracle under the game definition there. And the the game is is is picking which of these these measurements to process based on the outcome of a coin flip at the beginning of the game. And then the attacker, basically, what these oracle are modeling is the attackers interaction with the honest honest parties in the protocol. And at the end of this interaction, it makes a guess as to the value of the the bit. And we want that it's it's probability in correctly guessing this bit is ne better than one half. So that's kind of a classic in ind indistinguishable ability game for those who might be familiar with that line of. That line of thinking. Next slide. Okay. So the impacts of this work, yeah. So we we made some slight modifications to p three. There was also... We had... We found some insights about our popular one variant that also applied to poplar, and we ended up making some improvements there. However, the main kind of contributions of this work at least to the standardization effort are revised security considerations for the document. I won't go into technical details here, but this is basically all about dealing with things that the the papers on which these protocols are based kind of left open. This is...

Next slide. Yeah. And just as the quick aside. I don't know how interesting this is gonna be this audience. For those familiar with Mpc, you might be asking why did you go with games instead of the simulation paradigm? There's a a a few considerations here. So you will in the course of interacting with people, I think at U or the It of large you have heard of this thing called universal It is this very nice security framework for analyzing protocols. That has a lot of nice features, it creates some complications for our application in particular. Yeah. I I think I'm running low on time. So I'll kinda breeze through this. So on the timing, ideally, I think that ba is aiming to start but ten forty five. So you have some time Okay. Great. Cool. I'm gonna take it slow then. Take a. Okay. So the main consideration is guiding parameter selection. So the nice thing about these concrete like a concrete security treatment is you have a probability. Like under certain crypto graphic assumptions this is the... This is the best an attacker can do at breaking the system. And why that's really important in this case in particular is because we have two different security goals and we don't care about them the same way. So so for privacy, we wanna make no compromise compromises. We want the to to prove the tight bound that we possibly can. For robustness, we might tolerate us a slightly weaker bound. Because I mean I thinking from the perspective of a P, what this means is if you have a for which"

    "text": "you have a non negligible probability of, like, of of of a robust a robustness check failure. It means you lose some data, but you don't necessarily, like, not necessarily catastrophic. So this is a consideration because If we can tolerate a looser bound, we might be able to pick parameters that improve costs. So like think, like, if you have a finite field that you need in your protocol, you can maybe pick a smaller finite field. And the Uc paradigm based gives you one bound that you would then that implies something about, like, any kind of a threat model you might be interested in. Which is great, but here, it's it's it's it's a complicating factor. The second consideration is In this particular situation, we... As I mentioned earlier, for robustness, we're con a slightly weaker corruption model, well, actually a much much weaker corruption model because we need the be honest. So the fact that, like, for privacy and robustness, we have different corruption models it makes defining the ideal functionality somewhat complicated. And and lastly, I'll just s that. This is my personal view not necessarily held by my coworkers. In my experience, and from what I've seen, especially in the Cfr g, Protocols design in the Uc paradigm can sometimes push details to spec authors that are not always fully addressed by the specs. And I think that is a problem kinda a problem worth taking into consideration when thinking about using the Uc framework. Next slide. Yeah. So here's where we are. So P was formed last year.

Thank you very much for the presentation. Just just answer the the the last question. There's a very nice paper system customization of knowledge computer security proof. That's on prints. Which gives such a list of tools? It's a bit... I mean, it's three years old. So by now, there are a couple of new tools out but it's at least a good start. So I was asked to give a so you very much for the invitation to speak. I'm at work Crypto. So I found the some quiet place, but that there still might be some noise in the in the background So I'd I'd like to present to you an overview of some of the work we're doing with these computer tools, and and I'm all in favor of the the the call correction that we we heard from the the last talk to actually verify these these moves and the implementation. I will give some tools of how this could be could be done. This paper then I'm... So so I'm going to present two two papers"

So we look at what's currently deployed on the on the web? There many vulnerabilities as you can see in all all these libraries. And the question really is get can we do better? Next slide, please. And the answer, yes weekend. There there are many many very good libraries that have been completely verified So we have libraries that presents vision and C and Java. In assembly, and they're all verified in different in in in different tools. So there's some verified the easy tools in the App start, I mean top and So you can see some some presentation.

Could you go to the next slide, please? So so the good news is or for any modern crypto graphic algorithm, there's probably a verified implementation. But the specifications are written in and familiar languages. And what we what we present here is a tool to actually So solve this issue. Next slide, please. So here's the way it's currently done. So we start from the standards, and and this is For example, the just the standards that that are discussed at the At the moment. Then we go to a formal specification. Then we verify this against an implementation. Next slide, please. So you you know what this the standard looks like You've studied it many more of those then I have So this is a combination of English and pseudo and the number of published test records. Next slide, please. Here's what a a formal specification would look like. And as you can see it it looks a lot like what you've seen what you've seen before in the the ask, but it's at the moment that that still requires a bit of training to learn all these different specification languages. So here you see two two tools, one is called Easy equipped. And the other one is called F star. Where which is which are very good pulls in in our area. But it requires a bit of practice to to learn those, especially for people that are not not useless those. Next slide, please."

But there's still still a gap as you can see going from standards to the actual verified implementation. Next slide, please. You can see the same thing in a tool called Jasmine. I will introduce it lake later on. Jasmine is a high level assembly. And this will go to to very much optimized the assembly so this is actually done in a in a verified way. And next slide, please. So so as I explained for every modern crypto graphic Algorithm there's already to a high a verified implementation. And you can use it today. You do need to sacrifice performance it's often it's actually faster than than some of the practical algorithms that are out there. You will have mechanized proofs and you can And they're they're privileged you can run them and rerun them yourself. And most you don't actually need to we don't understand the proofs because that's what we have to machine for the machine will retract will recheck all the proofs for you. Next slide, please. But so so this is not so easy to to use, so you you will need to especially if you're only used the writing instead or notes an expert in writing these proofs.

So we need to carefully ordered all these formal specifications and they're written in tool specific languages. So it takes a bit of bit of experience to actually get to put all these things together in a very safe way. And The other thing is that they will typically produce c code, which is not the safest you would actually like to have this in a memory language like rust. Next slide, please. So This is why the language was developed. The design goals, it's it should be easy to use for Crypto photographers. It should be a familiar language and tools There should be small specs like pseudo coat. It's strongly typed to avoid errors in a specification. It's executable. So it's easy for debugging You can directly test it against the of test sectors and we want to have a translation in the formal language so that we can actually do the proofs. Like the game of proof that will discussed to the the last time. Next slide, please. So how much this language designed? So As you know, I mean many crypto pediatric engineers they have experience writing west code So Xp is a safe subset of the rest language without external side effects no bore.

To show you that what was available And what kind of produce what kind of code actually produces. So we have implementations in a whole bunch of bunch of libraries, and but the specification is all in this hex language. And then it checks against these different tools. Next slide, please.

So as you can see, we started from the standard as I presented before. Dan we went in a un way to specification. And then we prove the whole thing to be both So we have a specification. We have a a highly optimized implementation and we prove them to be functionally correct. So it's a huge specification. And moreover proved that this primitive is actually crypto.

So this is really if you're doing programming language research. This is the state of the art. And So reasoning about programming languages is, it's usually very messy induction groups. And no one at as we we just heard And no one really wants to verify those. So it's much better to verify those with machine. And it's the state of art in research now. Next slide please. So so that's the cop park. I'll I'll So so what I just explained you was the the green and and yellow part The the yellow part is a refinement of the the green part. Next slide, please. So I'm I mentioned just been before. What problem does it hold? Wireless have bugs. That they're verified c compile in the and it has been done quite a long time ago already and there is fast as optimization level one. So they're very good not fast enough for crypto, but still still very good. But they cannot be trusted to preserve constant time. So Justin was developed as as an answer to this.

So we did that for for, it has also been done for easy equipped for F star and it lean is front in progress could also be translated to a ke for instance So what we did was to take the specification in back and translate it to both both of the functional one and to the imperative one.

Now the next one was the question that was also raised in the in the previous talk. How do we prove catholic security. So this is done in the computational model. So you may know that they're basically, two models for security to symbolic model and the computational model. The computational model is more precise sixty game tell the Uc spell if you wants So in there's dedicated to support for this, for example, the the Issue equipped tool that was one of the the pioneering tools in this one is still use for many many crypto protocols at the moment. One downside of is equipped is not connected to huge mathematical libraries. Like in the system in the group assistant. And moreover it's not foundational. So not everything is reduced to the axiom of mathematics. So that's why we introduced Yes approved I inside the cockpit system. It it can we reused a huge less medical library. So if you need a piece of mathematics to reason about your protocol it it will most likely be there. It includes the game hopping. And categorical semantics if you familiar with that it also has a approved technique called state separating proofs. Which is a more modular way of reasoning about these programs.

Next slide, please. So here's here's what I try to try to explain to you. So we start from the standards, then we go to specification. So this is done by hand. Then we verify a functional specification against an imperative specification. We prove it to be equivalent to adjustment and implementation an existing guest adjustment implementation. And we get highly optimized assembly. And we have a approved that is highly up optimized assembly. Is actually next secure. Next slide please. So this is what I I'd try to show you and this is just one example of how one can use computer security proves. So we have a verified pipeline from this specification in to an efficient implementation using Jasmine and verified correctness inside the of assistant. More specifically for this.

Build some kind of understanding of where the the the working groups actually need potentially need some help with the design and, like, you know, those places. Okay? We know in security, this is pretty most of the most of the the the the security area actually would benefit if it's from that, but, like, from the other areas, I typically don't know.

For example, it seems like from from the little I understand it, quite a different approach to the approaches which you've been described today. So be interesting to see how these how these different approaches compare and what are the different types of weaknesses? And I think it would also be interesting to look at what sort of what sort of thing we can embed into the protocol specifications to automatically be able to track the models rather than having to manually go through this space notifications and then the right model.

Decades ago, actually. I didn't have involved in Seo that progressed formal specifications as if not norma. Certainly an informative document that progressed with the standard. And maybe the Colin point I mean, I've been involved in other Seo years and years ago that would progress as norma text.
