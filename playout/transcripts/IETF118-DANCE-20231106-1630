So, this is Dance, which is the Dane authentication for clients everywhere. I am West Hardaker, Joey, my cochair is unfortunately watching remote at the moment. But hopefully she will chime in at some point. We have a mailing list. As a reminder, The note well applies to all working groups. That includes, you, and that includes this working group. If you don't understand the legal context of what the note well means and what means to participate in an IPF working group, you should consult your legal counsel. I am not legal counsel, so I will not try and, summarize this too much. Do note that we have a lot of documents that talk about our sarons of behavior, including how the internet process works. Working group processes and how they work anti harassment procedures are expected code of conduct, how the IETF deals with copyrights and patents, both in in terms of and in terms of participation. And we have a privacy policy as well. The quick summary of our code of conduct guidelines how we expect all participants to behave in working group meetings, or we treat colleagues with respect We speak slowly unlike what I was doing before this. And we limit the use of slang. We dispute ideas with reasoned argument We use best engineering judgment We find the best solution for the whole of the internet not my particular problem. And we contribute to the ongoing work of the IETF and the group as a whole."

That has a, of course, a data tracker page, and, there's the high level summary. You have a mailing list if you're not subscribed to it. And then we have a number of active draft draft to consider as I mentioned, this session is being recorded Everybody will have to use the on-site tool or by scanning the QR code or use the tool, you can log in on your laptop in the agenda as well. We will, of course, be using the queue mechanism for determining who's going to speak at the on next. With some some exceptions for authors that need to talk, about particular subjects continuously, The agenda today is, fairly short we we just went through the the introduction I do need note takers. Is there anybody willing to take notes for the session, it involves using the notepad It should not be one of the people that are planning on talking a lot. Habis, thank you very much. You know how to use the note taking Excellent. Thanks very much. It really, we we just need the the conversation. You don't have to copy the slides verbatim, just, you know, important points that were taken away. We will have a discussion on the last call we had our last call was November of last year. It's been an embarrassingly long time, that need to finally get these last two documents out. They're basically ready to go. There's just the last couple of tweaks. Is Gayle here from ethnic.

And now everybody's really tired of dancing. And so we'll have to figure out if there's a future for this working group once we we finish these a couple of documents that need to get out the door. That'll be a sort of a concluding, discussion at the end of the day, but but keep that in mind as we go progress through things. With that, I'm going to dive into a 2nd set of slides. So I put together, I've taken all of the last call comments, and a lot of these were sort of discussed on the mailing list, we're gonna go through each of them a little bit of background first. You know, we we got a number of comments. I think in general, the documents really, really good, there's 2 documents, as I mentioned, both the dot date, the draft IETF dance plant off, Document and the draft IETF Dance TLS client ID. That have different purposes. They're both fairly short documents. There was some discussion on the list around them, but but there was never sort of a final conclusion of everybody's agreement. So today is the day. We're all gonna be in agreement by the end of this meeting about every one of the issues. I we will verify it on the mailing list, and then we're gonna ship the documents off to the AESG. That's that's the plan. To do that, we'll have a quick discussion at at for each of the last call comments that are sort of not fully resolved, I'll I have slides that describe most of them.

And we can verify the results on the list So we're going to start with the dance client off the first comment in question. So, any new participants in the and There's a couple. So so just so you know, this is what I warn all new participants about. We're diving straight into issues and there's no presentation material that gives you any clue about what talking about. I apologize. That's, buckle up. Because this is this is how the real work gets done. So the first comment was from Rick, and he he suggested that we had examples for both domain names and, wildcard and Dane TA. The document has some examples for, you know, it's easy to understand about how it's supposed to work we're sort of missing ones for these two cases. I think there's a few options here. We could find a volunteer to write some examples they're probably not needed protocol documents always benefit from examples, but it's not critical if if nobody's willing to write one. So having said that, is there anybody that feels we should definitely have examples or more even better is willing to write examples. Schuman, So, Wes, should I go just go sit there. Yeah. You can just come sit up here. So a few months, you know, an author on both of the two documents. Yeah. So my co author is Victor DuCupney So I don't know. He's usually remote.

So I think, I answered most of the last call comments, back in July. Right? And I think the problem was no one confirmed whether they agreed with my suggestions or not. On this particular point, I said, yeah, it's pretty easy. I can produce an example of wildcard Dantia. I don't actually exam understand the first example. Could you give an example for a domain name. What does that mean? So I think we need to get Rick to clarify what he meant or if anyone else in the room knew what he meant. Please speak up and let me know. I mean, there are plenty of example of wildcard DPA records. And we can easily I mean, I can make one out. If anyone wants give a specific example. They prefer for a particular application use case. Be happy to. We'd be happy to review that and put that in the document. I think some of these we will We we will not get through them all. I lied in the beginning. So this one, I would say, why don't we plan on this? If we get somebody to write an example or clarify them, then we'll do it. Otherwise, if you know, a couple of weeks go by and we don't get any volunteers, then we'll let it go as is without examples. As I said, I don't think, you know, there there's Example, RCs that I think are really well written. The I Mapping 1 is a great example in in the I met protocol has, like, an example for every single protocol option. It makes it really readable. It's better. It's better when we can pull that So this is actually one of the harder ones we'll we'll go through and they change quite a bit. The next one's from Michael Richardson. The transport label and coding may not be needed both D TLS and DTS are functionally dual usable already. Was a little bit confused by this. I think it may be addressed in the current draft anyway because It already says that the transport label is not needed. So"

We said if you'd if an application has a need to use something different, and they don't do that. I mean, I expect those details to be written in, application profiles have been. So remember, I think the original goal was we would have a dense architecture document, and then we'd have specific application profiles for the various IoT things, including Laura, one may be or, email transport security, etcetera. I would expect those kind of nitty gritty details about the format of the owner record PLS and record to be done in those documents. So in the general document, we give examples an offer script. So an application could define something else. So Yeah. Your suggestion is fine. We could leave it as it is, or we could clarify that that's the intent of the document. Alright. Anybody else have opinions on this one? There's gonna be a lot of people in this room without opinions. I'm just I'm reading that ahead of time. The next one is from, Bob Moskowitz. Are there any privacy concerns because client identity harvesting and dance. I actually thought this was a really good comment. Bob's actually here. Yes. So do we need better security iteration description. I I thought this was great. I I don't think it needs to be long. You know, Bob, certainly, if you wanna suggest text, that is always, beneficial but I I do think Okay.

I'm gonna notes in my to do list action items. So, excuse the Okay. I think this is an easy one. Why is there an exception that allows for a should when using an X 509 certificate, the the suggestion for Michael is just to change it to a must. I think you agreed with that as a correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. So, no, I think my answer was actually a little bit more complicated, Yeah. So, basically okay. Let me That'll go back to what I said. The reason there is a should for the X 509 certificate is So then client authentication, there are different modes. Right? You could use X 509 client authentication, but you don't have to. You can use Although this is not widely used in the field, you could use raw public indication, whether it's no certificate, And the binding between the domain name and the bug t is provided in the in that case, you, must use the client ID extension because protocol has no other way to extract the domain name identity of the play it, plant, But in in in in cases where X509 client, that certificate authentication is"

So Who's this is Michael. Right? So I I I think we need to get Michael to chime in to see if he agrees or not with with what I said, or if anyone else has any comments on this, Alright. Anybody else have comments on this one? I think, I think your explanation makes sense to me. So if if if you've already explained it to him, then, yeah, we should get him to confirm on the list but I think the conclusion is we will leave it as is given your explanation unless, you know, we always take everything to the list for for last you know, chances for people to comment since, Michael's not here. Michael's also the shepherd, by the way, to the document. So He so a lot of his comments came out of, his review of this document. With a question like this, Should there should there be a little more know, taking what you just said, and putting that into the document. Yeah. So, Bob, I think we did try to explain it in the document. Maybe it not explained clearly enough, which is what umted this question. So can go back and review what's there. And if it needs further elaboration, I can do that, or perhaps since you asked the question, maybe you can review the document. Myself. We have all been here.

How about this? I'll I'll go back and review again and see if there's any way to make the rationale that I decided clearer. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I I think, Bob, your your suggestion is a 100% valid that that if there was confusion, then an extra sentence in the document would go a long way to making sure that that was well understood thank you. That alright. So I put that down as, Shuman will see if it's further, if further elaboration would be necessary, but otherwise, we'll leave it as is with that extra text. Alright. The last one from Michael is, smaller wording suggests that you know, there's a bunch of knits that he had, and I I actually put the email message ID to look for it. Basically, they're all just wordy knits, things like using square bracket service to to better delineate that it's it's an example. It's not actually real world tech. And things like that. They were all straightforward. I I think we'll just accept those and move on unless somebody wants to fight over So, So we're halfway done. That was one document. Downside, I'd put the harder one second. Alright. So we need a check regarding the supported TLS version. This is agreed upon, but I'm bringing it here to make sure that it is we have references to TLS 1.21. 3 and DTS 1.3, and we have a reference to 844 6. Which is the framing extension This is actually, I think, the suggested text that somebody said that that, this extension supports these 2 and future TLS versions.

So I think this is just a text and, would be included in the in the paragraph now that talks about TLS and easy cut and paste reception. I'll give you the slides so you can cut and paste and then the other thing that was talked about was whether a reference to 6 0 66 was is needed And I think the conclusion from the mailing list was it really isn't needed as TLS extensions already pointing at TLS, which points at the extension, so there's no reason to do that. Anybody with comments on this one. This is this the suggested text then? This blob here in the center? Okay. Yep. That's seems fine to me. I I guess the one issue with future TLS version says Yeah. We can't really anticipate whether the extension in its current form will work with TLS 1.4. Remember TLS 1.21.3 different. So the, way the extension is positioned is differs between those protocols. TLS 1.2, we have to put it in the client hello, the first flight message. Which is unencrypted, which is a potential privacy concern. Until it's 1.3. There are extensions in the certificate message, which are encrypted. So we put it is a better option. So if TLS 1.3 has some new mechanism, then this protocol may have to change anyway. So I don't know if it's correct to say that the specification in its current form, will definitely work with future TLS missions. Because there may be some architectural changes, vertical which may need this to be updated. Greg, go ahead. Maybe then the wording should be and future TLS versions as far as we are aware at the moment. So just qualify it."

This is this happens all the time in the ATF for dependencies. We can add the fuzzy wording, and and you could also add some wording of know, where wherever it's appropriate to stick extensions. So that you sort of get a hint that, you know, if they had if they had yet another place put an extension to the protocol the theory it should just be able to slide right in, but, Yeah. Okay. Okay. So these get worse in complexity. Final slide, I'm gonna leave it all to you because I'm clueless. this one actually I, I, I get. There's a request for clarity on the client named So limit definition and the the the issue is We have multiple places where names can exist. DNS names, you know, on the wire can be 0 bytes. DNS names can be just the dot when you're talking about the root we define the Dane Client ID extension as 1 to 255. I think in written out Can they can actually be verbally written longer than 255? I I don't remember. Yeah. This is a slightly tricky one. So ideally, what we could have done, and I, I think we did contemplate this is we could have used"

    "text": "said the, client ID is defined to be like, a domain name, in a wire format. So that is strictly 155 or less. It cannot be anymore. Right? But what we did was because this is TLS, and we were talking to TLS folks, TLS typically represents hostnames in text form. Okay? So we did the textual presentation format of the domain name. And there it gets trickier because you don't necessarily know it might be off by a few bytes maybe less or more. I don't know. I haven't calculated it myself. So but don't know if this is a practical problem because I don't think rarely do we see domain names that long. So Yeah. I I I think that we can make it work where it's gonna work for the 99 sent case. I'm staring at Mark who is, like, staring at the slide and calculating the possible extensions, and I know it's in his head. The the only person in this room that probably in his head. The limit, names if you go out of LDH. Is 4 is 1 k. Roughly. I'd have to do the calculation. But, giving you backslash digit digit digit digit multiply that by 256. And then take away the the label separators and things like that. It's just under one k. Are you sure about that? I mean, I thought the DNS protocol says domain names have a maximum, of 255 offsets. Host names have a maximum length of that should have been into letter digit hyphen Once you go to presentation format, everything multiplies by 4. Say that again?"

It says 255, but you 56 whichever numbers, but you can't actually encode that in a on the wire format, an off by one Era there. So the maximum Maxman, that that Host name, 952, is one bigger than you can put in a DNS message. Nadini's. Okay. So should we make this one bigger then? No. No. Just just just say it's what the wire limit is 255. And DNS presentation format is up to 2. Up to approximately 10,024, depending upon what's encoded in that, in those lab So this is presentation format. That's the problem. This is not wire format. So why? Why formats will defined? So is there any limitation on why we couldn't go to 10 for to cover everything Well, Right? And and so I don't know if there's a if there's an issue with TLS or if there's an issue with I don't know. I mean, I'll have to think about that. So, yeah, Mark, maybe you and I can talk about this later. And then we'll come up with a suggestion. But there's more here, like, Okay. This is very complicated. I need some time to read this slide. Okay. The first part done. Right? The second part is the decode error led. Okay. Vaguely remember this one."

    "startTime": "00:26:01",
    "text": "Okay. So I think, the answer I think this came from Rick Van Rahim. He's saying that if we include an empty client, ID extension according to the way the protocol is written, That will be an error, and then you will get a TLS alert and shut down the connection. And, we do have an option to send an empty extension from the server to advertise the fact that it supports this, this mechanism. It it won't cause an alert to be sent because the way we have defined the extension is It can either be at empty or if it has extension data, then it has the presentations for my domain name. So I think that covers it. It's not written in TLS presentation syntax, like, you know, can be empty or not. We just, like, verbally said it could be empty, but if it's not empty, Here's the syntax for the, for the client ID extension. If there's a better way to write that in TLS presentation syntax, then I'd be happy to accept it, but I am not an expert in that language. Okay. That makes sense. Any TLS experts here that know how to write extensions or the TLS strict format really well. If not, we can probably go find Ecker at some point. And and and I'm sure he could answer us in 30 seconds. Okay. 5 seconds for Ecker. So that's that's probably the right thing to do, because we do wanna get it And and because it's gonna be reviewed later, And somebody will see it. So we should get it right out the door. Alright. So I think the two conclusions are Mark and Shieland are going to work together to get the right length for 255 and then We'll work with Echo or something to figure out if there's a better way to write the TLS presentation format."

I So I don't see that personally as a problem. Yeah. So I don't remember why it was starting one, but that's probably the reason. I just can't remember Okay. On to the next one. I think this I'm actually not positive which where where this original comment derived from I didn't get back to search through the archives properly for that. There is suggestions on on making requirements stiffer in order to improve interoperability and reduce code complexity. And I think this was centered around when using expedite 9 certificates, it should send this extension. And as a signaling mechanism. So I wasn't sure about this one personally because I thinking, Aren't there times where So you know you want the server to send it if they support Right? And I think that's in there now is a must. But I don't know that the client should must send it. It wouldn't it depends on a use case. Right? Yeah. I think that was more or less the answer that gave. If it was a greenfield employment where you know clients do this, then yeah. But, I mean, there's lots of mixed mode deployments where they you know, Mayor may not do this.

The draft should say what resource record content, it expects. And, I think the interpretation of this comment was Dane has multiple usage models now. Should we specify by which ones are usable in this context And then the suggestion that I think came out of the conversations was to just drop it as it adds more strictness than is necessary, and there was disagreement about whether or not they should go into the document. Versus a more specific one if needed. But but but but you might have better contacts. Yeah, I think I agree with US. I think is what I said back to, to Bob. I think We don't wanna be too strict in the protocol document. There's an application profile that wants to enforce things. Like, you can only use the NTA modes or selector this or matching type that, that They can say that. They can be stricter.

Alright. So the conclusion is we will leave it as is. An application specific profiles might make it more strict The last one hoping you understand better than I do. Joey said she understood it. Use case for mixed environments in terms of certificate authorities, It likely, I think that this was, Jerry reminded me this is most likely in the context of an ownership change of of records and things like that. I I think that the goal was to explain that situation and how it would actually work out or something. So it gets back to sort of an example Yeah. I think, I would like to get some more information from Rick, from what he means by environments. I remember I had a discussion with him at some point where I've thought he meant Mixed environments in terms of authentication. So client authentication or not, or you prompt for authentication later in the TLS session. And we don't address that because That's part of the TLS spec. And they can do that. Right? So you can do until that's 1.2, you could do renegotiation or, 1.3gative post handshake authentication. There are a bunch of mechanisms We didn't wanna get into those details.

In which case, we will have, pair of keys say, buttons are public key and the device private key on the device and, turn server private key and put in place public key on the transerver And then we will be able to compute by shot secret using a elliptic or deferment very simple, But then we need to, deliver the showing that the joints are public key to the device, which most of the case would be embedded meta filtering time, which has not very convenient in this case. A next slide, please. They, we Try to resolve this issue using DNS and using specifically data and then be, conveys the public keys. The the problem that we had say is how the device certificate the server as being the one it wants to join and the reverse have the server verified on the device. It's actually the one that's that's that's it says it is. They the next presentation, it would present them proof of concepts that we, did drop. So we used asymmetric cryptography and specifically elliptic curve. We used a rock of the key in the HSA records. And, when the device wants you joined the network. The only thing it knows is its own private key and a shared DNS trust anchor. And, of course, the idea of the joints are it wants to join. Next time. They normally,"

And say what we try to do is to change that because we don't have any, Sure. So you're ready to compute the message at computer code anymore. But we have, asymmetric cryptographies and we compute instead the signature of the message, so Here, we're using ECGSA. And this signature would be 64 bytes, which is a of our red, congratulate the origin of mess next sign. So upon reception of this, request, that transfer can extract the JVOI from the churn request and patch the corresponding share of every course. Then validate the authenticity of that recording in a sec, of course, and then once it extracts the complete key of the, insert code, it can validate signature of the request and then authenticate the device. But once the is, has been found at all of the computer shared secrets using, HTTPS Edge. They're here. I, played out an example of the that are recorded for you. So we have, like, a prefix that is lower showing than the, device, ID has been reversed. Which is, they're a priority call. Then we have, a common name space. Next slide. Sorry.

So the detailed old name does not change, compared to the previous year set in the chain we are not including it. And all the names are relative the the previous one, because we are in the same tree so that's it's possible. And then all of the records are sorted in a way that is, easy for the device to verify the The chain and inside the air set the Eruditus also sorted in the canonical format to, speed the verification and instant verification for the device.

So, the evolution of this work is still work in progress, but, so far with, well, the highest data rates, we're able to turn the device but advice is able to join. In about 30 seconds, most of that time is just the device waiting a receiving window, b impressed, form of the chain is so much better than the uncompressed word format.

With regard to postpartumcomputing and then it is constrained networks. We can't do it. We simply cannot do it. I've I'm talk I've spoken extensively with missed and others involved with it.

Yep. I, I, I think that's gonna be a problem for all low band with situations of, how to deal with that, especially high latency low bandwidth situations when you combine them both. So I joined the Q2. I actually had one question too. I didn't try and do a security evaluation of the whole presentation. I really appreciate your, your, your presentation. Is so I guess two questions. One is this deployed live today? Are are you actually, you know, fielding this, or is this sort of You said it's still work in progress, but you know, how far along on it, are you on the I say, this is all research work. So we've been doing a proof of concept where we've managed to to make work with a real device is not deployed, you know, for like, industrial way That's the question. That makes sense. And then my second question was, this slide caught me with respect to you. You're only using 1 DNS tech algorithm. And so, you know, and sort of similar to what Bob was saying, about, you know, future cryptography related things, you know, in the I ETF, we we have a requirement.

There's a lot of security professionals say that's a very dangerous thing to do. Yeah. Well, I agree on that that, that point, if immense. Which is one this algorithm here because of the constraint of the device but, is, I mean, in theory, you could use any algorithm if the device is ready to accept it. We'd say Yep. Understood. Shuman? Yeah. So one question. I'm, glad to hear that you're using ideas from, The TLS DNS Exchange Extension so when we designed that, we really didn't have, con very constrained devices in mind as a potential, usage. So that's why It says to use uncompressed wire format. May name switch, of course, causes you a problem. The DNS protocol has a compression scheme, its name but we couldn't use that because that's based on offsets from the beginning of a DNS message, and this is not a DNS message. The chain extension is a sequence. Of DNS records. So we'd have to invent a new compression screen. So my question was the seaborne compression of DNS messages scheme that you're using, I you mentioned there was a draft I wanted to ask, what is the status of that draft and where where where is it being worked on? So But this is a format has been used to the inferences powered by this draft that is not, compared to this draft totally. I've spoken to the authority of the draft, and there is a few things that I could change in the form that I'm using to make it bit more compliance, And also the fact that currently the draft does not support in a sec And I think it's I'm not sure what is being discussed"

I don't know which one it is. was thinking it might be useful to get some, DNS I protocol people to review that draft and, particularly for the chain extension, maybe we can see if we should, extend that to use it if it's in reasonable shape for consideration. Well, I I think the other is, spend to to make it Well, to go with, along with the DNS people to review it. So Okay. slip in another question. This is more of an operational And then you can question rather than protocol question. You mentioned you're managing intermediate trust anchors, so you don't have to sell and the full chain from the roof. I'm just curious how how do you maintain and manage that? You system or how are you proposing to do it? If you haven't deployed it in production, so Changes. Thank this application. It is possible to do it because everything is under the the same name space. So it will be the same as mentioning, what I providing the root, trust anchor into the device. I mean, one trust and correct the other. I don't it very differently. Not sure. I I don't think that answers your question. Okay. Yeah. I I'll follow-up with you. I have a few more details to share, add you about, but, I can do that Okay. Alright. Thank you very much for the presentation. Appreciate it greatly.

So, assuming we get the 2 critical documents out the door, which is really the whole point of forming the group. We have one more on our existing charter, which is the architecture draft, and it seems to have fallen in activity to the point where, somebody would have to offer to spend a lot of work to pick it up and and and bring it to fruition And when this working group was originally formed there was a a strong push to do future work afterwards. There was all, you know, use cases and all sorts of other there's a real question in my mind, Is there a future beyond the point where we get these last two documents the door, and no is a perfectly acceptable answer. You know, we getting 2 documents out and actually having call. Defined it in place. You know, we can spin things back up later if if you know, there's a sudden spin up of of energy. But you know, unless I hear unless Joey, I should say, hear from people that are you know, wanting to do new work in this group, it's most likely that this working group will be shut down. I've talked to the quality area director about it. If anybody has comments about that now, great time to speak up and especially if you have ideas of things that you wanna work on and and, drafts you wanna propose. Some of it would require re chartering, of course. I, you also love. Go ahead. Yeah.

Again, not sure if there is an appetite to have this as a part of lease working group, or should we take it somewhere else? Excellent question. There's a lot of identity related discussions happening in the ATF right now, including a buff this week on identity management and stuff like that. So What I would suggest you do is write up a description of how you think that would work with dance. And just just a couple of paragraphs, that you can send it to the mailing list, and then we can discuss it there and, and be willing to say I'm willing to author a document. That's you know, of course, what we need the boats and if we can get you know, momentum around that, fantastic and so thank you. Due to time, I'm, I'm gonna cut the cube at, Jacques, and then Bob after that. Check your own. Yeah. So Very quickly. So we wrote an internet draft to link Digital code and trolls, To Dane, our TLC record, I think that's an implementation of dance, But if we use it as is, I don't think we need to do more than this. It's it's more around the usage of name records, not the protocol itself in the DNS. So Oh, Right? So there's pre existing work that you can look at too, in other words. In fair, there's a lot of detail. It's it's really useful to use dance for digital credentials. But I don't think this is the right working group to define the the usage around it."

The TLS say records, and that's specifically what I'm gonna be doing. From from from my usage. So I don't see that that being, you know, that you can come with any generalized approach to that. And so it's like, you wanna use TSA for clients know, figure out how you're gonna get them populated Yeah. And there there have been deployment discussions in the past. One thing of course we would love is a you know, internet wide multi architecture kind of thing. But but what is been discussed from the very beginning of dance is actually much more focused on I have one specific use case. I think one of the early, you know, descriptions was cars driving into a garage and, you know, multiple vendors with a car and and you could pre deploy the right things with and then, you know, publish client keys in the DNS by the manufacturer where you get cross manufacturer you know, TA anchoring and things like that. But narrowscopes. And I was speaking with Roman this morning, actually, who one of the ADs that helped start this group. And he was saying even narrow deployments be great. Right? You know, any usage of the resulting technology is good, even if it's not I have a client that I can use, you know, halfway around the world to somebody that's never heard anything before.
