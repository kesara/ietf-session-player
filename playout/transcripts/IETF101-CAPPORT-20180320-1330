    "text": "so next right yes and this is just yeah this is kind of just talking about all the other things that are probably already being done in order to solve this thing kind of I think other organizations Wi-Fi land specifically WBA are already working on trying to solve this problem so it is that\u0027s that\u0027s right but the problem is going to be solved the question to this working group is that if part of that there\u0027s something that where we can leverage the capital API to actually make it make a better solution right what the working would be open towards entertaining that and adding that to the captive portal API work right i mean we charter explicitly says we don\u0027t do you want to worry about roaming staff onboarding and provisioning stuff and you know things like that but this is not about our use our trying to select a network this is more about helping a user verify that they actually did connect to the network that they intended to connect right as opposed to being an evil twin network so anyway next slide I guess so that\u0027s that\u0027s just my general question is I just wanted to see if there is interest in that of this first is does this will fall somewhat within the scope of the Charter is there any interest and it\u0027s so maybe I can talk to the other people that I\u0027m working with especially in other organizations would receive if we can come up with some crazy way to solve this so thanks for bringing the question here I as a chair this is definitely not in our current charter whatever we produce him may be used by others to do any number of things and that would not be our responsibility or would require explicit collaboration necessarily but I will let the people speak to see whether or not they\u0027re interested in in what they have all whether they have ideas about what what you might do Tony Polly Apple is this an interest I mean to people in really probably yes yes I think it\u0027s interesting music within scope I don\u0027t think so I don\u0027t think this is the right place for that I do think that the degree to which this overlaps with cap hood is very much kind of a PVD stuff so I think it\u0027d be interesting to look at that as a Potter maybe like with Indy area where we do the PPD work see how it fits in there right because that is also a JSON blob that is a network identify that we\u0027re trying to validate in a very similar way to this we view the kamcord stuff as a extension for the cat port interaction itself but the relationship between cat port and your network provisioning like a PVD or DSP Ras seems to be very similar to the relationship between what you\u0027re talking about and that same provisioning so it\u0027s a "
