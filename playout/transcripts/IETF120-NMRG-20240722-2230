So before we go into the session, let me remind you a bit of a different not 12. So the first one is regarding intellectual properties, so because at the MRG, as IRG, as IRF, we also follow the IETF integrity property rights disclosure rules in particular you have to disclose some information already to interlector property in a timely manner getting patents and also So of course, here you have the different reference document that you can also look at"

Well, it's closing on Thank you Thank you talking already Just let me know when you want to change the slide. Okay, that's easy All right, my name is marco liebsch from NECL labs This material is joint work with Martin and Neil from University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt in Germany And next one. So we actually started looking into some well spending thoughts on the complex and challenges associated with designing, building and operating network digital twins. So we started looking into the right side, the sensor networks"

Now we start looking into transit networks and mobile core networks, which is a bit of more in overly So the draft as we published, exists in its initial version zero zero and it starts discussing practical aspects and challenges when designing and operating network points Martin and his team at the universe of Applied Sciences in Darmstadt, they started to get experience from some hands-on experience by building and STN-based network to show Quinn, which we started to report about in this draft too So it's a little bit of complementing the already adopted work in the RG group about use cases in architecture for network twins All right, without listening or discussion all the content of the draft, so if you're interested, please have a look and give us feedback So we start with some assumptions and claiming challenges. So of course the network twin needs to be aware of the network that is has to build and represent a digital copy from about its level of abstractions and of course about the data points to collect from the network network functions that are associated with a network at least one model needs to be applied to perform simulations emulations. It receives broken requests from users that want to see how particular network change has impact on the network operation as one example That should be separated from in enforcing these changes in the physical network well physical network may not be the right term because it may be a version"

    "text": "network two, but the operational network or active network, the real network, whatever should be separated the probes from a user can be either intent or the use may also have the skills and capability to ask for particular changes in selected attributes. So he may not need to have an intent but have control on the net skills and capability to ask for particular changes in selected attributes. So he may not need to have an intent, but have control on the network and knows what he does Scale and curious So, well, compared to a twin of a robot or a twin of a set of sensors, is different from a twin of a net network. The network can be arbitrarily large So the larger the network is, the more components it comprises the more the higher the volume of the data points to collect and take it account gets. So the notes to monitor are diverse too You have switches, you have routers, whatever you want to consider in between. So that really depends on the use case and what the twin is to be used for Accuracy, the more accurate you want to model a network, the more data pains they need to collect So scalability and accuracy are to improve factors to decide before you design and build a network between. Also, the users of a network twin may be very diverse and have different experiences on what the twin should do for it They may have different views on the network abstraction levels. And parallelism may also be abroad problem if you have more than one user of a twin. So if they try to model or even enforce a particular change to the network in parallel there may be a conflict or an interference so that's aspects some of them we describe in the draft that are to be considered considered We sketched a few functional elements"

There is more, which can be added later on, also in terms of further the test budget So just as an example, we sketched a network twin, which we intentionally separated from a network controller here So the twin should have an OAM kind of system on top of it and an interface to it. For example, to initialize or change the network twin in its behavior For example, about the network that is being monitored and to represent and build a twin model form In terms of scale, in particular for large networks, we thought about distributed deployment of network twins and model federation so to a large extent we even thought about in-network computing to build a twin only of one particular node or of that node with a few neighbors which keeps also the collection of data points, the latency in transmitting the data points to the twin model very short and accurate. And then to have all these distributions twin models instances federated, so they can collaborate with neighbor models and here we introduce it twin-to-twin interfaces, as you can see here model verification so in particular if you make use of machine learning, artificial intelligence models they may be accurate for a certain time but they need to be verified if they are still accurate enough you may operate one AI-based twin model and in the background on train"

Shared network control as you see it may be shared by multiple users but also by multiple instances of a network twin which on the northbound have the control to schedule monitoring policy and to receive data points and in the end to enforce changes to the network So that's a shared network controller, something that implies a couple of more challenges, which we describe. And then last one at least, NBI semantic interpreter and solver. So there is an interpreter function which receives the probes from the different users They have to be interpreted either its detailed kind of actions or its intent based So that kind of probes need to be properly interpreted all right so talking a little bit about what martin and his team did, I think it should be online too for detailed questions, probably with a big cup, of course in the same So the software defined networked when so they started to build a twin based on STN open source and they wanted to see about the real complexity behind extraction information from a physical network how to feed back from the twin back to the physical network They have two extremes defined which is a static test system, which is just a snapshot of the real network in the twin and then you can apply changes and at some point on demand push back the change to the physical network or a live reacting system which they want to look at but that's the next step so live reacting system is more real-time close-loop synchronization between the real network"

The overall objective is to find first tangible experiences with that implementation and to mention it's not conflicting with further extensions which they do in the next that implementation and to mention it's not conflicting with further extensions which they do in an extent. So the number of questions challenges are some of them is, of course, looking at the interface between the different components that we explain before and which you can also find more detailed in the group's architecture draft. Granularity, which information and of what time is required in terms of resolution resolution Advanced challenges like conflicting changes to the twin or modeling required it's out of scope for that current activity Next slide is the last one So that shows the principle of the test bed that has been built by Martin and his team. So it's a static test system which represents snapshots So you can have a snapshot of the physical network in the network twin, including an S- controller in the network that you see below You can work in the twin part and on the demand push a button and you enforce these changes in the physical network. So the implementation is based on the OSDN controller in both the physical and the twin network VNFET being used to retrieve the topology from the SDN controller and the physical network and to copy that topology the virtual network, and the twin Container Lab has been used in a virtual environment and then actually on the left inside in the region network real switches have been used and accordingly models of these switches are BT part Southbound interfaces to the ESC controller GNMI has been used with open config young models"

Thank you Other questions? So if you have questions, you need to enter in the queue from the tool, please Sorry, yeah disconnected. So we have Who's first? Two questions Actually, maybe two. For the static test system the snapshot, does it actually contains information about the flows in the network as well The snapshot that we take from the static test system, does it contain the flow information from the network so we can actually replay it? or do you envision that? It is more states, not on a per flow basis okay as far as I learned from margin right the second question is about the real time so when we talk about the real-time implementation, of the NDT, what type of requirements do you envision that this will put on the interface between the digital world and the physical world? How fast we should actually be able to communicate between the two ways"

So you may be happy with a snapshot-based approach, but real-time really depends on the accuracy and speed and simulating and at the same time enforcing these two changes to the network. So it really depends on the use case and the user behind, in my opinion but do we have marking there? Can he also comment? mark smith. Yeah with you after the meeting as well. I have a couple of questions that you can probably talk and see what are we going We can do that offline. Absolutely, yeah sure. Thanks, Michael Yeah Carlos Bernardo, Sucidriam. Very interesting piece of work I have two questions. One, maybe I missed that part, but does this network digital twin support also applying like AIML to forecast some of the status of the network or the components? that you have in the digital twin and free based on that in addition to reacting based on the action proving that you do in the physical network elements well you prove and see the reaction of your probe and change in the in the twin and then you can decide if you enforce it in the physical network the model or the the the SDN base network does not yet imply any model which allows you to predict. So that's one of the next step okay and the second question is do you plan to put available any of the software as open source for others to play with yes that was recent work and currently the paper is being written and"

I mean, what is your, let's say, your learnings or feedback you can share on this specific entity? let's say, experiment that you are doing? What will be, you say, aspect of the challenge is that we have addressed? this or we were really having struggled with this aspect? you know, real-time, synchronization, parallelism, what would be your experience and learning? So the challenges and the thoughts is having struggled with this aspect of real time, synchronization, parallelism. What would be your experience and learning? So the challenges and the thoughts, it's based on brainstorming and experience so this is a real first hands-on experience Maybe there is more advanced kind of experiments which would be the pleasure to review and discuss about. So this is just hands-on experience and one of the challenges is really different levels of accuracy you need from the systems, referring to the arsmas question about a flow base twins and accuracy So you have IPFIX, you have very Referring to Arsma's question about flow-based twins and accuracy. So you have IPFix, you have various tools to export flow information, but the amount of data you have to process is enormous And if you need to do that, not for a single node, but for many nodes aggregating that information is a problem Bringing that information from a very far away endpoint node in the network to the aggravation point that builds a twin. You have a delay, right? and how that delay has impact on the accuracy of the model that's something you need to consider So that's something like lessons learned, but as said, we are more progress with the challenges based on analysis than with the hands-on experience of ESC"

    "text": "Thank you this is Paul from SKU So, very good presentation. So Marco I have two questions. The first question is so operator point of view, it gives us some kind of some goal or some intent, like a so operator point of view, it gives us some kind of some goal or some intent, like so end to end, some delay or some throughput something like that. So that kind of, however, requirement should be translated into some low level some computation having some parameters right? So how? do you impose that kind of, you know, computation? some generation given? certain goal or intent? That is my person So let's clarify before in general a network twin should support both intent, but also detailed kind of configurations from users regarding probe and enforcement Your question, is it related to the theoretical analysis of challenges or regarding this product? right so a kind of prototype For the prototype, we don't use intent We use the regular SDM controller's northbound interface that a user can use to apply changes in the twin and if wanted and also enforce it in the physical network So it's not intent based, but experience user okay good so second question is about the accuracy about network between the model. So the accuracy is very important to give good feedback to a physical network so my question is how to build the model for digital twin, and secondly, so if there is some discrepancy"

Yeah, that is my second question so from practical experience point of view i cannot give you a good answer, but from research perspective and I think that that's well known, right? It really depends on what users expect from the network twin and that has impact on how you model the network right so maybe you don't need to break your model down to physical node or even a part basis. If you have a switch, do you want to consider all the 32 parts? of the switch in your model or you just model that node based on the switch? plate capacity and you can even go more abstract here so which abstraction level you consider really depends on what you want to model with your probes and then get a resultable. OK, I see. OK, thank you Sure, you're welcome Thanks for all your comments and questions Is there are more? Yeah, there are two more questions One is from Cheng Online, yeah. Chair comments and questions. Is there are more questions? One is from Cheng? One line, yes. Hi, Chair and Hi, Marco. Question here, the first one is that what will be the resource company? to support large-scale? switches of fibers or waters in physical networks? Because you are using containers to build the virtual tools right? The second question is that what will, how to build"

So maybe here a kind of decentralized approach for building a couple of twins which federate with each other is a better approach. Or you observe your physical network and don't have accurate models of each node that you deploy in the real another approach Thank you Marco, just to be sure I understand the kind of workflow here in this static test case, so you're twin initially reflects the state of the network traffic etc. as it is. And then you have testing applications where presumably you're trying different states, etc., to try to optimize something and then have found something you like, you may"

Yes, that's correct okay and then in an automated system you would have to sort of put that in a closed loop i mean it would have to know the objectives it's trying to optimize use the digital twin as a sandbox sort of automate the process of finding a new or optimized solution and then that's what goes back onto the network Yeah, and the second option, you have way more interactions in terms of a closed loop, monitoring, reflecting in the twin Thank you. You're welcome Ali, you're next? Thank you for a great presentation You know, as someone who has been working in this four years, one of the biggest challenges that I have faced is the scale. You know, if you really want to have a twin of your network, it's huge Either in simulation, I have tried in emulation, I have tried after a while you are consuming so much of resources and energy that you can't scale it anymore. So has there been any thoughts around that has there been a way that, for example, you think that we can go into data? data-driven approach, AI-driven approach without loss of performance that we want to get out of training? Well, that's more a general question, not on the SDN prototype, right? Well, it is actually related to SDN as well because you can't scale this I don't think you can scale this Yeah, well, that's the point. So we start at small, so we scale but uh if we have more no notes, probably we run into problems, yes it's the same question as before, similar as before Okay, but maybe just one comment to this point on scalability, because I think scalability can, depending on the dimension you're looking to, can be addressed or can be"

    "text": "more challenging. Because if the scale, for instance, is let's say the number of instances you can represent, you know, maybe some limits where you can scale, but maybe you have other constraints to scaling it could be more from let's say as Michael was mentioning about the time response Because if you want to reach a two big network and you start to have too much delay, then you scale is not the issue, but the scale is coming from the breath of the network that you're trying to address from a time perspective so I think from the challenge from the draft challenge point of view I think scalability is labeled as it. But maybe when you look into scalability, it may not be triggered by the same aspect of what you are trying to do the limiting factor may not, maybe scalability, but it may be generated from different let's say, a lifestyle phase or constraint of the system that you are trying to move It's various aspects, the resources included but also if you have a large network, I mean, bringing a huge amount of data points over the network to a single central aggregation point may consume even more resources, but also have a negative impact on the accuracy of the model because they are not time synchronization also have a negative impact on the accuracy of the model because they are not time synchronous. You may apply PDP to all these nodes to have synchronized clocks and use timestamps with your report, but well, you have to really assess also the cost that you invest in getting an accurate model or if the approach from design perspective is a better one which means a more decentralized approach that but Ali please share I mean offline or on the mailing list or feedback to the to the to the draft about your your experience on scalability issues and of course this is research exploring also what could be path to address those scalability challenges that would be much welcome thank you sure thank you yeah rashme you still wants to have something to bring just a quick comment on natural scalability so this is"

So the more precise that they just digital tune actually is following a network device, for example the more detailed enough capture. And that basically puts the requirement on in terms of in terms of scalability So the size of the network, how far you want to actually be able to represent a device you know to what details these are all come to be to play a role in terms of your scalability I guess one part of the research could focus on like, what levels of digital twin for the network can provide what type of services to the user right? That could be a good, probably, research topic to add actually concentrate on if I want to draw a couple of because unlike the physical world like, which I'm trying to actually, you know, create a digital between this, this, this, this, this on. If I want to draw a couple of, because unlike the physical world, like which I'm trying to actually, you know, create a digital between this room, the network device requires a lot of, you know, effort. And by the time to, actually, you, we get to represent a little digital twin of a device like a router, then why do I need the physical router anyways? Because I have a software version that actually is behaving just like that So we cannot really expect the digital device in the digital world to mimic exact what the physical device is doing because otherwise we are abolishing the, we are diminishing the physical router or switch So the software switch, they're already there The question is that how we can use the existing ones without going to the extent of completely resembling the physical nodes and get the biggest bang for the buck Yeah, well, first extent of completely resembling the physical node and get the biggest bang for the book.

Essentially, this is the concept and reference architecture documents My name is daniel king, Lancaster University Next slide, please So some of you may remember that there have been several threads on the mailing list regarding questions of the documents mostly around terminology concepts, some of the functional components, the previous version of the document was closely aligned with using NDTs in the context of a SDN controller There were also some documents that weren't being referenced externally, external documents These are Etsy, for instance, ZS work that had NDT requirements and what we ended up doing was having a long with the several email discussions, some interim sessions specifically to talking about digital twins"

No. Try again, yeah okay. So where were the changes made? Specifically, we have introduced the logic elements in Section 4, which sits above some of the functional components of the network digital twin we've expanded and clarified the key functional components of the network digital twin This is done in section 7 and I'll go through these in the little more detail shortly We also provided, I guess, a framework more than an architecture So how you would take those functional components of the network digital twin and apply them sort of instantiate them for a particular use case.

It's Another key area that needed further discussion, really to kind of round out the document itself was security. And there was previously sort of a general statement about security in regards to digital twins and maybe this sort of covers some privacy aspects as well as and confidentiality but clearly network digital twins represent a significant security concern there are certain actors certainly threat vectors that are could be used to attack or gain sort of unauthorized action or information about the network. So what we information about the network.

We'd like to try to make it as clean and it's easy to read as possible. Great So specifically, you know, these are the changes and you can see them in the latest diff but we kind of moved out some of the logic function from outside of the digital twin to essentially feed into the digital twin, so you would be able to kind of ask a series of questions depending on the organization the type of analysis that you're looking to perform using the network digital twin so it may be security, it may be planning, it may be some kind of optimization, it may be re-optimizing the network after some catastrophic phase failure. So all of these are sort of certain types of analysis or function that you want to use via the digital twin We also provided some text along how these logic functions are actually used. We have rewritten section 7 or seven, or at least expanded, section seven to talk about how these functions can be applied And then this is the sort of framework where we take some of those architectural components and use them in a specific instance"

We've already sort of discussed previously that there may be some computational limitation for the size of digital twin that you would have to build depending on the size of the physical network. And what we don't want to do is essentially use the same computational or compute resource to model a network that is actually in a, maybe in the context of NFE the virtual network, the VNN that are being instantiated to provide network connectivity and certain types of services obviously require a certain amount of memory and CPU and network, you wouldn't want to replicate that when you build a digital twin in order to set up or deploy services across it So what we've tried to do here, is show how you would realize a network digital twin and what the sort of closed and the so the inner and the outer loops and the relationships between the data and the functional component I mentioned the security section, so this is the high level sort of, I guess, the section and the the subsection, the kind of data that you would need to consider in terms of privacy and confidentiality"

Great Great Erasmith from Molli. Cool questions The first one is that the interfaces between the physical and the digital world So I'm assuming that we're going to at some point define those control channels and the data collection channels My question is, are we planning to actually piggyback on the existing protocol? or not? Is there any mention of this thing in the document? Or if not, probably that might worth mentioning that in the document? Yeah. So thanks for Ashnaud or not is there any mention of this thing in the in the document or if not probably that might worth mentioning that in the document yeah so thanks thanks for Ashton so this is exactly what we want to avoid and it a really good sort of observation The kind of use case that I've been looking at for digital twin is sort of optical net networking, multi-layered optical networking And there are several interfaces that we could use in order to kind of extract information from the network Some are sort of control plane specific, other management plane specific. And actually the more I investigate how to kind of generate the digital twin from a real network the more options I find and the more kind of scape and computational requirements or concerns I have So I'm kind of minded to kind of leave things as they are and just make some assumptions and say that some method would be required, whether it's netcon of minded to kind of leave things as they are and just make some assumptions and say that some method would be required, whether it's NetConfyang or rest, some kind of restful AP or a passive instance of OSPA or ISIS or something else in time"

Thanks, I rationally. The other question is about the security. Do you see, so given that the existing monitoring and configuration systems basically somehow have to deal with some of these security issues that exist out there Do we see additional risk and it might be some comparisons that we might actually make? between these two aspects and see why using the digital twin requires an extra caution? in terms of security perspective yeah and it that's another really good observation look as as an as an occasional IETF engineer when I write a protocol specification or extend an existing protocol or write a Yang model, I consider the security implications for that specific layer or that specific interface. Now what we have here, is the holistic approach And I think what we need to do is really consider the security implications of a system rather than a single interface or a model or you know it's a specific even a single layer And I think actually the IETF does generally do that sort of work You know, what we have particular areas and working groups and they're very narrow. And now we kind of need to actually look and say, well, what happens if the system is compromised? What kind of access will people have access? to and how do we harden you know and what are the threats vectors?

Thank you okay so let me ask a quick uh two quick taking the comments from the people in the queue, but we have to be quick, please, because we still have two presentations and we are a bit short. Thank you. So let me ask a quick question. The first one is clarification questions So Daniel, so can you explain? the difference between inner loop and close loop? So yeah, what difference is? between two loops? So the inner loop is essentially taking information from the next what difference is between two loops? So the inner loop is essentially taking information from the network and then generating a model of what currently exists or forwarding technology and then applying the specific objective function that says sort of test failure scenario or set up a service and then as the network changes over time, you may get a different response or a different answer depending on your intent and then sort of an outer loop may be an external factor that's not being modeled by some sort of direct information from the network. So this could be a multi-dimensional situation or some external environmental factor that may also be considered when performing some kind of optimisation or planning function I see okay so another one is a comment. So I look through the text in this section So I think very nice picture, but it will be better to add some more some reference such as the intents relation or some closure control something like that some other"

We can include Okay, I see. Thank you All right, thanks, Tanya, for the summary of this update. Very quick so one comment, one question for curiosity. So the comment is I think it's good to go beyond the framework or the architect that's presented in a draft and bring a kind of more concrete example for a particular use case So I don't think this is a reason to strip it off from the architecture Second, it's a question. So do you have anything that substantiates this? little bit more complex? system that you present in the example? Is it something? that you just derived on paper or is there a kind of prototype? Yeah, it's stylized So there's, yeah, it's conceptual.

To give you an idea what we did in this paper is we, by using a knowledge graph, we were able to combine data from the network topology model, also from IT interfaces, and open coffee interfaces Okay, so some potential application of knowledge graphs. The list is long you can see it in the draft, but here I wanted to highlight a few. First is, service assurance. This is the first application that always comes to mind. Because if you take a look at sign, this is a graph with dependencies between services and symptoms. By integrating this data the same data in a knowledge graph we would be able to combine this data with other data like for example, device data and data, or network topology data Similarly, network digital twins. We have seen a couple of presentations before, and that one of the reasons for introducing the knowledge graphs today, because Network Digital Twins sorry, the knowledge graph paradigm is well aligned with the architecture proposed in the network data twin architecture. In fact, it's mentioned a couple of times in the draft And also, it aligns with the work that it's been done in the DEA Digital Map draft, where in this draft the authors are identifying core concepts and the mappings between different giant models, and this is precisely what we want to achieve in the knowledge graph and similarly the data manifests"

The process is mostly manual so that's why we are also exploring ways to automate extraction of knowledge And also exploring in this sense if we should go for standard methodologies to help people develop this methodology, sorry, this onto ontologies for their use cases, or work on standard data models Second scalability. This this is also a very important challenge because the size of the network is huge, getting more complex So for this, knowledge graphs could be distributed the network is a huge, getting more complex. So for this, knowledge graphs could be built on distributed and federated architectures. Also, they must handle high volumes of data and also another important issue is real-time use cases this could limit the adoption of notice graphs so in this sense, the construction of a knowledge graph should have very low latency to support these use cases And another kind of challenge is network configuration Because typically network monitoring is say, the first use case for integrating data in the knowledge graph but we're also exploring the possibility of how having configuration data and the knowledge graph as well"

So I don't know if this could be the IETF, go for an open source community approach, more agile see more people, external people involved And the last question is if this draft would be better in NMR because as you know, this has been originally proposed in the MMOP working group So that's why I wanted to throw this question today because on the one hand I see the concept that an architecture made could fit in an MRG and then have more practical use cases in EMOP Let's see And the last slide, the next step So of course, the goal is to keep collecting feedback from the working group and the IETF and looking for interested contribution um i know all the seems very abstract so to better grasp the idea we started working on a prototype to create a knowledge graph based on the augmented gile library extension"

Yeah, maybe one question question. Regarding scalability, here you referring to scalability to build the ground? or to use a graph about because I think if you build the graph is to be more efficient to access and retrieve data should be more scalable right? Yes, so here the idea is that to address scalability, one of the questions is that in a distributed or federated architecture you could have fragments of your whole knowledge graph spread, let's say so for example you could have some fragment of your knowledge graph at the edge and the other at the cloud And with this architecture, you could have a uniform view of what you have in both That could be an option to address scalability Okay.

I'm just making, see, eventually, if it gets into an RFC what will be the type of research outcome we want to get from the draft? so if we start to bring in use cases or expand the draft to too large scope, this may be challenging when we start to go for publication because this could be more challenging questions.
