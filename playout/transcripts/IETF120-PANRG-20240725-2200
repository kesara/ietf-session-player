I assume that if you are here, you're probably already know what Zion is about and, you know, if not there are a bunch of draft, there is an overview draft that you can read This is a pathway architecture. We have some early adopters in the field of finance in Switzerland and so on. And we have three core specification drafts that are the ones that you see down in the slides And yeah, I want to share some updates regarding these three drafts today so back then at last meeting we had a couple of presentations by some of the early adopters so we had six and they presented some things about the banking network that is based on Cyan. We had an appaya the Cyan vendor. They also presented some operational aspects of Cyan back then And then we had our usual discussion where that is work fit Is it something for the research group? Is it something for somewhere else? And after some rounds of discussions, we ended up submitting the core specification drafts to the ICE. So this now has been under ICE review for a few months And so I will share a bit some of the updates that we have done to the draft Our goal with this draft is to document the existing Cyan deployment as it is deployed today. So that also means that on this part, we don't want to do that many changes yet. We just want to document what is in production"

And these three are the drafts that are under ICE review There is an overview and a component draft that we wrote some time ago. I think these today are not really maintained. So I think one of them might be expired And later today, we want to introduce some ideas for some drafts that could potentially fit in this research group regarding some of the open research questions that we have and some of the deployment experiences Regarding some of the updates one of it is about IPR So on a PIA system, the Siam vendor has submitted three IPR disclosures regarding their intellectual property on Sion. So I think the licensing terms on two of them are quite liberal, no license required. They are patents that mostly concern not directly the core protocol specification, but more like optimizations that they have in their own stack. So if you want to know more, about it I think here you can find the link to the IP disclosures We have been looking at it and we're also not aware of any other IP in relation to Cyan All right, so going back to the draft, there was actually quite some work that we put in onto the draft.

We have been doing also a bunch of editorial stuff, for example, regarding wording and so on. A big part is on security considerations. It is something that was missing when we presented these drafts here in the research group before. Super important so now all drafts have it Ianna actions, well there are no Ianna actions, but we have a reference to the current registry of Cyanne numbers so this ISD and a Ianna actions, well, there are no IANA actions, but we have a reference to the current registry of Cyan numbers, so this ISD and AS numbers. This is currently maintained by Annapaya and in the process of being transitioned from them to us Cyan association Besides that, let me give you a quick overview of the content that we added to the drafts. I won't have time to go into the details, but I'll try to leave quite some time for questions so that if anyone has a question on a specific topic, we can look at it So back then, in one of the past meetings there were some questions regarding time and science. Zion is doing this path discovery with segments that expire and their certificates and so on So time synchronization is actually a loose requirement. So we tried to make this clear by outlining in the drafts what are the dependencies, what is the clock skew that can be tolerated between components. It is within the order of minutes. We also added a section about what is required to configure to run Sion AS in terms of for example, link, interfaces, and so on So we hope that this is making things a bit clearer Then we added a few more content to the various components so on the control plane we try to clarify some of the validation requirements for segments also in relation to"

So part of it was not really fully specified and we added some text there was actually some work on this at the hackathon at 118, so the API originally was using GRPC on top of quick on top of HTTP2. And there was this hackath project of pumping this to HTTP 3 Actually, it seems like this is now making into the actual implementation. So we updated this into the drafts as well one new section is as well about scalability so this is a topic that we introduced quite a lot in our presentations. The key concept is that the cyan routing plane is split in two parts a core doing like in a inter-ISD routing and then an intra ISD routing and then an intra ISD and then an intra ISD routing. And while this helps overall with scalability, there are still some trade-offs to be explored especially when you look at the core beginning part this is based on some kind of loading that means that if the network, if the core Cyan network grows, then this would scale poorly with this approach. So the way that the implementation is handling this is with limiting the amount of, let's say, routing discovery signals or what we call path construction beacons to a certain number. So we added a few considerations on that on the trade in terms of you know overhead versus discovering a certain amounts of paths. I won't be able to go more in the detail We also added some text regarding the time that it takes for the architecture to discover paths, also in relation to a feature"

So what we try to do in the draft is to clarify what are the security guarantees that are provided by their current implementation especially by the current implementation of what we call vanilla cyan, what you have in this draft So the main objective security wise, is to provide path authorization or making sure that the paths that are made available to endpoints are actually authorized by the operator Of course, hijacking prevention is also one of the security properties in mind, so we discussed that There are, of course, a lot of other experimental extensions that are not part of this eye of the security properties in mind.

So we added a bunch of considerations on on that also on how the certificate can help prevent that an AS is proof on the other hand, we also add considerations about the availability of certificate authorities as these certificates are quite often short-lived so they need to be renewed quite often We have also some concerns about the data plane regarding path hijacking. So when it comes to path, this, discovery, the fact that paths are authenticated may that hijacking is difficult for us enough path AS that might try to, let's say, spoof this path construction beacons In the data plane, there is a case where on-passing"

In the data plane, there is a case where an on-path attacker might be able to divert traffic into an already authorized path this is possible because the vanilla cyan implementation described in this draft does not provide full integrity protection in the packet. This can be avoided by adding a mechanism that provides that. So there is an experimental extension similar to IPSEC that can protect it. The attack model here is already relatively strong because the attacker is already an AS on path so yeah Besides that, regarding the data plane we quite often got questions regarding this mech mechanisms the length of the MAC message authentication codes So this is six fights, is it sufficient, is it not? sufficient so we have a discussion on this on potential collisions another aspect regarding the Cyan data plane is that at forwarding all routers in an autonomous system share the same key And so that means that in case of compromise, of course, path authorization is temporary compromised within the autonomous system So we add some thoughts regarding that There is a discussion about path splicing so that basically consists of stitching together various parts segments that we not originally meant by the original sender into something that is still authorized and this is generally prevented by a field, but of course there are some trade-offs in terms of field length.

So in that sense, depends on where the buff is going, the two things could be potentially complementary. There is a strong component of path awareness in Nasser, where paths are already discovered in an authenticated fashion.

We have here some network some autonomous systems with some interfaces some egress and egress interfaces. What they do is they create these PCBs or path construction beacon these tokens, where they write down in a cryptographically secure manner, their ES number and the ingress-egress interface number for them, and then basically they have the choice either of creating new ones or forward new ones and so on so forth So it's similar to a flooding algorithm in essence It's just some qualifications that we're going to do on top of that. But in essence, that's what's happening Yeah, we see that beacon traversing now, it's going to go to AS4 maybe to AS5 later, and so on and so forth So as you can imagine this with many number of interfaces this could create a geometrically growing number of PCB that would be arriving to these networks So what the ASS2 essentially is basically select which PCBs, which tokens which they had received, look better than the other ones. They rank them, essentially So they rank them and they forward the ones that are best first and then as time goes by, they will be forwarded the other ones as well Now, we have to, we remember that each one of the age have private policies that they want to preserve they don't want to forward traffic from one interface two certain other interfaces and so on, so that policy definitely comes into playing to this filtering, to this rank"

So for instance, have a seen that AES first or not? So trying to connect as many AES as possible, of course. But the is also metadata in those beacons that might be very important for other networks to select them or to be able to select those paths, for instance, according to latency The metadata is I didn't draw that at the end of the day diagram but just imagine that these these becons also get to an annotations about latency, bandwidth, available bandwidth, or max bandwidth and so on So at the very end, what we have is just that the AES is that we see these beacons have received a filter version of what the complete network looks like, but that filter, that ranking, is a composition of this ranking functions of each one of the AES that were on the leading part of that path what we want to solve at internet scale is how can each one of these AES that we solve that picture communicate the preferences, what they would be good for them or their ranking function essentially, or the semantics of that ranking function to the AES that would be forwarded those vehicles? While at the same time, we would love to preserve the privacy of each one of the AES that's given to the transit AESS, and at the same time, if possible, to be anonymous so that they, you know, some kind of trusted computation but ideally in an anonymous manner okay um"

So it's different for different applications, a video conferencing tool probably wants to have a very low latency path, while FTT So it's different for different applications, a video conferencing tool probably wants to have a very low latency path, while a FTP application would love to have high bandwidth with not too much regards about latency if they were completely orthogonal, yeah So there's the same principle also possibly a solution for one would be a solution for the other, but we don't know yet Now a simpler, a simpler task would affect kind of a lot of architectures not where network architectures would be if we have a path that is being used from a client to a server and that communication going back from the server to the clients the reverse path, is going to be it's going to last for quite a lot of time What happens if that path is about to expand? That's a question that we had among me going to be, it's going to last for quite a lot of time. What happens if that path is, is about to expire? Yeah, that's a question that we had among many of them. Whether we even have to standardize the way to do that, whether we have to introduce a way to specify policies from the client to the service to pick up the next path, whether per convention they will always use the same interface sequence and just renew when possible, whether the client needs to send again a request, even an empty request, just to refresh the path and so on This is a very simple question, but we also ask ourselves yeah, should we actually stutterize something like this? for example and questions like this"

And I think we might have sometimes some answers, sometimes half answers. I think it would be very interesting to document this and discuss keep the discussion going on with the research group. So we laid out a draft. This draft as well is really just a skeleton right now with some open points of ideas that I think could go in this direction. So one of it's relates to for example deployment model and interoperability. This was a topic I think it was also raised today at the Nasserbov that signed today in the productive net This was a topic. I think it was also raised today at the Nasrubov. That sign today in the productive network is still using a gateway for the final network that do translation from Sion to IP. Is this viable on a global scale? Do we have to look at other approaches? So there are more research implementations that push Cyan down to the stack but of course this is a lot harder to deploy"

Besides that, we also have with our community of early adopters we also have some material, for example, some operational guides regarding, for example, running a Cyan network, running its governance There is a whole PKI that introduces some, let's say, special governance models for these ISDs. And for example, in the banking network, they came up with some policies and processes and so on. So I think there is some material these people are not necessarily people that show up here at IETF meetings but we thought it might be interesting to bring some of this, topics here. Another topic is regarding scoping of this ISD I think this was raised by by Juan. So right now we have this semi-closed networks in finance. Then how do we take this to us? wider scale or is this just the let's say, niche where Cyan belongs? as a solution? It could be, I don't really have another do we take this to a wider scale or is this just the let's say niche where cyan belongs as a solution it could be i don't really have an answer and i i would love to hear i think people's thoughts on this there are some additional operational questions and also experienced learned, for example, in running this autonomous system various older aspects of managing the group cryptography, certificates, rotating them and so on, setting up these control services This is something that we don't really have in the ice drafts, as they mostly cover the specification, and it is something that I think might be interesting perhaps for a research group there is a topic of connecting ISCs so this goes back into this topic of whether you have like some semi semi-isolated networks or something globally connected.

So next please So the motivation for this was the work in the direction of providing visibility or observability about the energy consumption related to a path to a given path thinking on services like SD-1 services or other services like in the future slides and so, that could make use of a specific path so somehow defining means of collective the information related to the energy consumption for that part of the paths this means to have metrics about the power consumption between a source and a destination So yeah, and as we all know, there could be different alternatives for that, so the idea would be at the end to decide what could be the more convenient path according to the request from the customer So the objective is to define such a kind of a API. We started defining a rest API. Now in this new version, we have also provided some idea of JAM module about that And I said this information could be consumed either by external applications, like SDI1 or any other kind of service or even internal So for the internal decisions of the operator in overlay services that could be CDN or could be packet core or this kind of overlays that could run on top of the transport network We already presented the draft in Prague you don't remember wrongly so yeah I will comment on the updates right now.

So there are different analysis and studies you can see some reference here We can say that maybe the construction could be something like apparatus distribution, so 80% of the consumption is constant independently of the traffic that is being carried and the 20% or even less is proportional to the traffic that is the case nowadays but we can expect that in the future with new capabilities on the devices. We could have more proportionality of the consumption according to the traffic being carried by the devices So it is with this expectation what we are so how researching on the on the possibility of having this kind of API next please so as said the objective here would be to have ways of exposing the consumption for a given path So what we can expect is the song kind of system requesting the network controller or any similar component a view of what is the energy associated to a service The energy consumption will be dependent on the path for sure and the path at the end is dependent on the device characteristics the architecture, so how many layers, what is the top topology, the transceiver bid rate, so what is the speed of the transceiver, number of hubs, also dependent on what is the energy mix feeding the point of present where the device is hosted and so on so far.

So we have added these new attributes. We also have work on a subsection for recursive usage of the API, so we can have multiple layers so we can somehow request the retrieval of the information for the IP layer and then for the optical layer and so on so far so doing subsequent requests We also have added an initial description of a jam module so that we will somehow work in the duration of the API but also having a jam module that could be consumed by other systems The recursive usage would be one of them for instance also we have reported some potential aliana considerations for the attributes and so.

Well, we don't provide the details in the draft, but we are essentially doing this, collecting information from the devices using open config.

For sure, the metrics should be refined more we we acknowledge that it's not very good metric, but more or less this is the idea of implementation. Yeah, traffic proportionality was the next thing I wanted to ask about. Okay, so are you a assuming a linear function which maybe is the most common But by now, yes, I said, we are just considering the energy of the SFP, so we are ignoring the energy of the fan, the chassis all of this so we are doing proportional right now. Okay, thank you Welcome OK, so yun chung from Huawei and my question is that for this new added parameter named a carbon intent So it's mainly for runtime or it's for the full lifecycle Well, it's a very good question because somehow the carbon intensity has a notion of long run It's probably having a very real-time value make no sense because it's so valuable. So it would be more a person of long-run. So to have a kind of average, what would be the energy means that is feeding the particular point of presence that is hosting the device. So that would be probably the makes sense. Okay. Because in time you probably, this would imply complete of having interaction with the mechanisms that are somehow controlling the electricity grid and so, so this is quite complex for probably would be essentially looking at the what is the average consumption along the time maybe per month per week something like that and then applying that value"

I think it could be interesting to also add certificates or labels to this. You know, there are routers that are certificates to be, I don't know, have a certain level of greenness in the way they are being constructed. So with that, you can there are routers that are certified to be, I don't know, have a certain level of greenness in the way they're being constructed. So with that, you could be possibly getting the information that on this path, all, the routers you know have been built in accordance with some green standards or whatever. I mean, it's just an idea because it would be pretty static, right? Not so hard to provide. It's an interesting idea we will think on that for sure there is on standards or whatever. I mean, it's just an idea. Because it would be pretty static, right? Not so hard to provide. It's an interesting idea. We will think on that for sure. There is some effort in the benchmarking market group for benchmarking the consumption of the routers probably that could be the source of that kind of labels that you are mentioned I don't mean consumption, I mean in production you know, like when you buy a device, that device may happen a label like it has been produced"

So you're basically, I think the draft is saying that here is API but how those were remember reading the draft, please correct my, I'm wrong. So you're basically, I think the draft is saying that here is API, but how those values are calculated are out of scope, right? So just again, stupid question So do we know that those values can be called? It's like is it fundamentally possible to know like renewable percentage in carbon? intensity to be reported by a router? or a path yeah in that case would not be reported by the router that would be taken from external system, maybe inventory or so, because it depends on what is the energy mix of the point of presence so that would be but that would not router. That would be taken from an external system, maybe inventory or so, because it depends on what is the energy mix of the point of presence. That would not come from the router. What we could come from the router is basically the consumption of the active parts of the router. So as the ports, the transit the guard, that would be obtained that could be in principle of dynamically. Also, it's true that could be obtained from the inventory be obtained, that could be in principle of thing dynamically. Also it's true that could be obtained from the, from the inventory. But other things like the energy mix or whatever that green property and so would not be out retreat from the router probably we require to reach like the energy mix or whatever that green property and so would not be a retreat from the router, probably we require to retrieve from the inventory or something like that. So from static source of information i'm just curious if it's like static how does it relate it to path well for instance the energy mix of the clean label would be a property of the router, so the depending on the path that we take and the router that we pass through, we can retrieve that"

So with those schemes, the larger the pass, the larger the whole overhead. To mitigate this aspect, and still provide a sense of verification by intermediate nodes, you have some schemes that are denown as probabilistic, and in fact, on those mechanisms, intermediate nodes can verify some packets and the fact that a given intermediate node needs to verify this packet or not is given by a probability distribution so we accounted for the probabilities that nodes on the past would verify and we took it into account in the competition of her over here so this a"

We discovered that when you do defilment key exchange or with several intermediate nodes, this take ages because public keycraft is not really performant in the internet even if you are using elliptic curve to clarify So you can only alleviate the effect and the performance burden of using public ecotography to establish shared keys between source and etymeter nodes by using two thorough methods The DR key method, that was designed by researchers at ETH Zurich closely working with Scion our symmetric key predistribution by hand, by configuration you name it Now, also in the setup phase, signings the information of the session, signing the pass is not representing a very large impact on performance so just sign it is not a significant.

And OPT, performs in a very good way with regards to improving protection on the pass compared to Epic So in fact what as a summary and as a key message, as a key takeaway message from this presentation, I would like to stress that from our observation, of obviously not in production environment, but on something that we actually developed and deployed in a Linux kernel and measured from an example experimental perspective, we shouldn't be afraid of performing proof of transit in the internet because the impact of such mechanisms can be controlled and is limited if we don't have a very high protection level so we can we can have a don't have a very high protection level so we can we can have we can steer whether we want to have a high level of protection with high cryptographic cost but if you want to limit the cost of proof of transit from a cryptographic perspective, there are some mechanisms that already provide some good protection and properties of verifying the path that can be used that can be deployed, and that can be beneficial to the community So thanks a lot if you have questions I'm open to answering as much I can can Okay, I do not see anyone running to the mic and no one in the METEC So I guess, but I hope people will continue discussion on the list. Yeah, sure. Yes, thank you very much for presenting, very interesting. Okay, this"
