    "text": "primarily with differences in capacity capacity is a big issue always was and isn\u0027t actually the biggest issue the biggest issue is when you have a radio link if you have a radio link of any type which kind of you know it\u0027s just many types of links we actually find in the internet that it\u0027s not actually the volume of debt that\u0027s the problem the problem is that when you transmit a packet you incur a certain amount of resource in actually sending it over the radio link supporting use different technologies or different configurations on the return link to the uplink every AK you send consumes radio resource it may be the total cost of a sending an IKE is the same as sending a data packet so you could spend two data packets you send one act packet two data packets one act packet this is kind of disproportionate using one third of your radio resource for sending acts mmm not good actually much worse than this because the radio link in the return Direction is often contention based or demand assignment might see a completely different technology completely Radio characteristics it costs more to send accident just to send data often really TCP doesn\u0027t know about all this mean and so people deployed act thinning and other methods to solve this and they reduced the a crate rather than the arc volume in this case and it really has a big effect on your system design that doesn\u0027t mean your network runs faster or slower because of this what it affects is the bottom-line cost for the person providing the network so if you\u0027re the radio operator the ISP you have a cost and this reduces your cost which probably reduces subscription costs for the service so there is a round effect it does affect the user okay all the background done and this is what TCP does here\u0027s do you lay back after slow start if you want to pretty slide of it you start sending lots of acts thing you send less acts and it works this is real plot and next slide and what about quick aha quick and we should think about quick because quick let\u0027s take a different security model if you were smart you would realize that all this great stuff that\u0027s in keeping the internet afloat for years no longer works well okay so we have the same path but the path is different because we use quicken we encrypt the acts and the data packets was quick trying to do it tries to send according to the current spec and Ike every two packets it mimics TCP so actually it\u0027s just in how did the same problem as TCP and he\u0027s got an act delay interval it\u0027s slightly better because and if you\u0027ve got a they lost then he only acts for a little bit of time and then it realizes you don\u0027t have to send acts continuously I didn\u0027t need to use delay that\u0027s after saw start because that was a TCP thing but the basic thing is you can\u0027t use any of these performance enhancing devices on "

Dawkins thank you for bringing this here Gauri this is this is terrific for us to think about the one thing that I was gonna say just to make this more of a research problem probably is it did I didn\u0027t hear you talking a lot about the situation where like the physical path this is changing that\u0027s okay I think I think you\u0027re right Spencer because I think that\u0027s what can cause this as well as the radio link well I\u0027m talking about the remembering problems that adapt yes and then the plane flew over the mountain yeah and so remembering might make things better or you might be remembering old information and have to recover from that so I think I think that like I say I think this is terrific and I think this is terrifically important this is directly relevant to a project proposal that I saw in an IETF working group within the past three days and surprise I pointed them at what not to do but this is a much this is a this is a much better description of specifically what they\u0027re looking at thank you for thank you for bringing it yeah and and just to fill up what Spencer said if we if we have boxes on the path we might have various things chained together on the path we saw that earlier that it\u0027d be nice to have right good tools to know what was happening here so we can debug this stuff at a higher level you know you can\u0027t just believe things happen magically at the higher level you need to have tools in the network to understand what\u0027s going on to make this stuff evolve at the higher level then question please thank you Tim Costello from BT yes very good presentation and nice results in there I work also on 5g standards set up "
