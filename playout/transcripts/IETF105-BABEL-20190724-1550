    "text": "possible solutions for this so basic we could put all time stamps in the ihq messages so that it\u0027s self self-sufficient the main problem if we do that is that we would we would copy a time stamp several times in different ihe messages so it\u0027s a lot of per packet hope ahead and that\u0027s over two ways to do that Judis provided in another solution which will be to send timestamp in a separate TV that does not depend on hello so you could we could require that if you solve an IH will time stamp you also send miss new TV and then there\u0027s just another version which is to say that if you implement this extension you just have to - send a hello with each eye each you so that we don\u0027t have this problem so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s if it\u0027s very clear do you have any any input comments David\u0027s classy I like the alternative solution that way we don\u0027t have to break our e because this is deployed in production and now that we have a unicast hellos I think that\u0027s also like pretty easy in case that you\u0027re running over unicast so that\u0027s what I would personally recommend okay yes right so I\u0027m not I didn\u0027t actually catch what it was that Bobby avid was recommending the alternative solution which at the bottom of the slide which is anytime you say none I heard you and you\u0027re using this extension also send a hell yeah okay so I was going to suggest another breaking change which is in nanosecond resolution time stamps so while we\u0027re breaking things however more serious it doesn\u0027t have to be breaking because we could define both and then it can be and there\u0027s no one but that makes the other help even bigger so it\u0027s it so it\u0027s a did you talk to Dave yeah but "

    "text": "your to Dave Todd by the way just to clarify yeah that\u0027s so then the second resolution is nice but is very use case for it and are you it lives difficult to measure like to attempt some with a good enough resolution that it would be useful like if you do this little something is using in userspace you wouldn\u0027t get a nano second position I guess nobody you can get better than microsecond resolution so this is sort of like the use cases you can have the protocol show you the fastest way through your data center by RT T so it\u0027s sort of a different use case and I\u0027m not sure like I don\u0027t have a deployed use case for it right now but like there\u0027s some interesting things happening with pace networking and you can sort of put timestamps into the hardware and have to eat the ethernet device paste them out so I think it might be feasible to actually have needs the lower granularity at some point and it would be a shame if we define this as a standard and we cannot do this so it\u0027s more sort of from from that perspective another issue because the tension currently is in 32 bits yeah that would have to be the congestion yeah you would have five four seconds yeah reply to a message so probably something in between nanosecond and microsecond would be nice yeah be visible or just a bigger field sorry could you find another buyer yeah because it yeah maybe she\u0027s like Julius is that if you want to be able to interpret an IH u timestamp you need to have a hello at the same packet so it\u0027s not quite correct that being the implementation if you have two new features which are unicast heavens and unscheduled heavens which I think problem if people think they don\u0027t solve the problem that we can define a new Tod that you can send at any time with the wrong view to send a blank stamp without attaching it to hello we don\u0027t currently have any use cases and we deployed use cases for microsecond resolution the initial version of the extension a long long time ago actually used 20 seconds hundredths of a second they put some "

    "text": "pressure on us to switch to microseconds we have I would really like to see any convincing worst case before we switch to nanoseconds and if we switch to nanoseconds then we need to have 48 bit timestamps as that is pointed out and then we need to do 48 but cosmetics and that complicates the implementation so it\u0027s not a big deal but I think we should have any convincing use case before we do that [Music] yeah that\u0027s fair enough and I think it would also be possible to add it in later if we define the base if we define the base extension which in all ways at a another field for higher resolution either just like add some more bits that is the fraction of microseconds in a separate TLV or define a an alternative one that does the same thing but with a different resolution so it\u0027s not sort of a big deal and I kind of agree that it\u0027s probably a good idea to not break the deployed base so we already have one flag day four so specific on battle day right so if we were going to make a flag day for this it would not be able to make it into the same release or so it would be a separate flag day which I think we should avoid timestamps and then replicate the old one so for me basically if we if we break compatibility because of what\u0027s written on this tied to social one assertion to where we can also break it to change the reservation but if we go with the attentive solution to just require that you should send a header even I hear you then let\u0027s not break it just for the reservation yeah I\u0027m just nodding so I agree let\u0027s try to solve this without breaking anything and then add more resolution to the time staff afterwards when we have a use case not fine good odd days can assi just question for "
