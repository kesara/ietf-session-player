So this is near the beginningoftheweek. So please if you haven't already seen the note well or wanna refresh yourself, please do take a look at this. This is the terms under which we participate, in the IETF. Make sure you're familiar with requirements for what we need to disclose, And also, As a reminder, you know, this is an area where we want to have, productive discussions, I think this group is, very good at that. And, So we appreciate your kindness and consideration towards everyone in this group as we try to work on and build good standards. Alright. So here's just some of the logistics. If you're on meetup remotely. You're already on here. So thank you for doing that. For everyone who is in the room, please do, scan the QR code or join the meet echo on-site tool some other way. And this is also how we do the queuing to make comments at the mic. If you are presenting, we can share your slides for me to go here as the chairs, you can also ask to share slides, from your own device either is fine. We do have a note taker. Thank you very much, Stewart, for doing that. And We can have people watch the chat. K. Great. So here, is our agenda today The first chunk is looking at a number of our adopted documents that we've had for some some of them are new, some of them have been around for a little while,"

And then finally, as normal, we will have some lightning talks These are expected to be just a single slide for a topic. Where people can introduce new work and highlight that to the group. Any agenda bashing? Before we go on. Okay. Thank you. Also, actually, one more administrative thing I'd like to note, we should have put this on a slide.

We have been airlifted out thank you to Martin, for having guided us as a transport ID, thus far, but now we are over in So doesn't change too much other than how, you know, what area director is gonna help us shepherd things But we actually think this makes a lot of sense. This is very much related to a lot of other work that goes on in ops. And, Hopefully, we'll have more cross collaboration there. So Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Alright. Oh, Greg, do you wanna Please comment.

Thank you. No. Neither of them were able to attend, ATFF this time around, but they just wanted to provide an update to the working group on the capacity protocol. Document, So there is a update to the draft, which 7, that was addressing the sector. Comments. So I think, they would like to see some more reviews from the working group on the list about that. So, you know, there's a summary here. You can read that this is posted on data tracker for the slides. But just everyone here and online up up, if you have reviewed this before, please do take another look. Take a review of that document, and we would like to be progressing this pretty soon. Okay.

Maybe a little bit too to course in a sense because essentially, the application requirements has to specify a list of percentiles and then like, a a a perfect and they're useless or or unusable, for each of those those those percentals. And so let's say you specify latency numbers for the 99th percentile. And then you have more than 1% packet loss. Then your call to outcome would immediately drop 20. Because your the latency distribution goes beyond the the sort of point of unusability for that percentile. That Could make sense, for some applications, but I think it's likely to be Yeah. Not the most not not the best way of dealing with it. So what we are suggesting is to to look at packet loss in a slightly different way where in addition to the latency percentiles, you could specify a Sort of yeah, if you look at the the bottom right corner of the slide here, a network requirement of packet loss number, for perfection and unusability, and then we can do the same sort of interpolation between these.

So And, you know, maybe this is just an artifact of how I'm looking at this slide with a graph here for packet loss. But But Is the scale of you know, perfect lack of packet loss to unusable packet loss. Is that linear? Or to do we also need to express a difference there. Because you imagine, like, There are inflection points. At least in my experience, of you know, up to a certain level of packet loss. Yeah.

What we And and, I mean, we have the same issue with the latency percentiles. Right? Or it's also a just a a linear interpolation between the endpoints. And I think There is a sort of simplicity versus precision trade off here. But, yes, we could make that more complex if needed. So I I guess just to understand the suggestion is, like, if I I don't need to set my perfection to be 0 I could say my perfection is 0.5 if really anything up to 0.5 is Fine with me. Yeah. Exactly. Martin Duke, Google. I mean, I've been worked with your analytical framework at all. So I can't tell you what's easier, but, I think certainly you can model. Packet losses latency. I mean, certainly, if it's a reliable protocol, packet loss is latency. For the application. Even in, like, a, like, a, what, a UDP case, like, you know, you can it could be infinite latency. So if you find that be conceptually convenient. Like, you can proceed with it, but, there's certainly no problem with saying that certain applications have a threshold for packet loss.

Differently. Right. So based on the obvious observation, have you taken into consideration of different kind of apps, maybe a voice app will behave because it has different latency requirements. Versus a, let's say, Facebook app will have a different requirements. But, If you say that high latency leads to packet loss. That's a very general statement. Because there are different apps. There's different clients. Thank you. So the so the The way to model the requirements of different apps is to set these percentile thresholds at different points. So if an application has a a sort of it it can function well with even like, moderate amounts of latency, then you can you can express that as sort of setting these points of perfection further to the right, if you will, on this graph And if it's a very latency sensitive application, you can slide them to the left. Right? And you can also because the the framework is very general, so you can add latency requirements for different percentiles, you can say, if for something that's very sensitive to latency spikes, you can add a requirement to a very high percentile in the in the distribution to express that, this is this is yeah, this application will easily be affected by even short, bursts of latency.

Please. Please. Yep. Beyond, this is Luis from Telefonica. I I have, like, a a government oral, I thought, let's say, about the notion of network requirement. So, I, I think that So how this can be dual in the sense that probably can be also seen as a kind of application requirement. In the sense that applications are adaptive as well. So somehow what you are assessing there is are the network conditions or and and probably from the application something can be done in order to adapt to that conditions. So my comment is that probably is more exact to to comment about service requirements or or network conditions rather than legal requirement because help put the attention on that the only thing that can be done is on the network. Probably something else can be done as well on the application. And there are, adaptive applications. Probably be more a suck to to to refer to hardware requirements or or network conditions. That's my comment. Thank you. Yeah. That that's a very good point. And I think that, Sort of if the if the application is very good at covering up sort of network degradation then you can you can actually set a less strict requirements on the network.

We are just using a gmac which is basically a mode of GCM. So just like a hash mac. Right? So we renamed it to ICV, which is quite consistent with existing solution like ESP with, or edge in ipsec.

It's a little bit more complicated. And we want a solution for all option types to work the same. So we are going to focus on here on trace option types. So this solution is the one that is currently, in the draft. And You can already do that. If a transit note processes a feed or or flag triggering actions from the node, then the node must check the header. So, basically, this is the case with the exception time because, you know, on each hop, it triggers, you know, the export of IOM data. And this is quite similar with trace option types. With the loop backflagged because on each hop, you would have to loop back the packet to the the source. But the problem here is that if you want a transit note to check the header, it means that it has to recompute the old chain From the first node, the end cap node 2 up to itself because you have a shaining of ice TVs here. Is not efficient at all. Right? And here, obviously, you would have each IM notes to require all the previous notes keys too. And by the way, the pending discus is not solved with this technique. So probably not what we want here. Next slide, Greg, do you Greg, do you wanna make a comment to this slide, or Greg Mursky Erickson.

Right? No. Why not? Because RFC does not require that. But if they do not, what's the point of the text then? It's a local policy. Basically, you you you can, generate you can, send packets, through the management plan or through any other means, by aggregating statistically processing locally, their raw statistics. And operational state that being collected based on trigger packet. So so that's decks is very different from trace loopback. Yes. Trace looked back as defined now. Automatically requires sending packet back. But dex does not. It's not in the RFC. It's one of the options. Yes. But it's not required. Alright. My bad. So I should not have to context as an example here. Yes. So if probably it will be good Dex somehow excluded from this processing? I'm gonna cover that later. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yep. So, basically, if you want to improve the first option 1a. The only possibility we have to not recompute the ocean is time you wanna check the header is to obviously add a nice CV to the packet. So, basically, it's don't have much room available in ipv6 options. So it's not maybe that good, but anyway, if you do that you are now able to have the end cap note generating the ICV for the header and then the ICV for its data field. And the same for, again, transit node. So as mentioned here, the encapsulating node would have to perform 2 gmax"

And, the pending this case point still unsolved in this case. So if you go to next slides, We wanna avoid that GMAC two times on the end cap node, we could, for instance, just change a bit, the semantics of the ICVs, and instead of having the IC, an ICV for the header and ICV for the data fields have an ICV for the end cap. ICV for the transit notes. In that case, that work but still have a drawback, which is that transit notes would have to include, to require, to fetch, IOM, data fields from the NCAP node just to check the header. Again is not seventically, That's correct. So, and this is even worse if you have deal state snapshot and include it in the trace. Because in that case, you cannot rely anymore on the note length. So instead of using the usual button up. Barcing of the trace, you would have to go top from bottom. And then go back. And still the same problems as previous. So next slide, please. So just to say that the common problem industry, possibilities are that you have to check the header So if We do that. It means that we have to somehow trust IOM nodes. Initially, we wanted to provide a solution where you don't have to trust any notes. Alright? So, basically, here, the only alternative solution is to avoid avoid checking of the header. And if you think about it, if we go back to the the original focus of the draft, it was to just have IOM protection of the data fields, not necessarily the header."

So just an example of search field would be the namespace ID, which is a common field, between all IOM option types. And maybe we would need one more field, which is, option type specific. So for instance, for the trace, option type, we would have the trace type included as well. For the proof of transit, we would have the proof of transit type. And for the edge to edge, the edge to edge type. So I think It would be consistent, and we don't need any other fields. So, Let's review actually, This solution on the next flight. Craig, did you wanna go first Good question. Sorry to interrupt. Greg Murirski again. So if we can go, one slide back because one thing that, again, what I wanted to stress and, encourage offers of this, work, to distinguish is different, behaviors of I am trace options. Because, when we have proof of concept incremental pre allocated compared to direct expert So direct expert does not, put any data in a trigger pack. True. Right? So the impact and security, ramifications, seem to be different. Yeah. Yeah. At the same time, so so as we discussed earlier,"

And you still have the usual, you know, shading of ICVs, etcetera, on transit notes. This one Actually, matches what we wanted at the beginning, which is don't trust any note. This is probably the best solution even though this is maybe not that elegant on the day cap. No it has to, you know, check all the chain, which means n gmax. Depending on the number of nodes. But here, again, the pending discuss is solved in that case, because you don't actually freeze the structure of the header because you only need 2, fields. And this is gonna be consistent with any new feature option types anyway. So It's quite acceptable in that case. Next slide, please. Yeah, we're gonna see 2, other alternatives. This one is actually a proposal from Ben in its in its review. Let's call it, neighbor validation. So in that case, it's a peer to peer validation. This one is quite easy. So basically, a node would just gmac the entire trace. So the entire header n the nth air pre allocated block. Now you can include even mutable fields from the header because it doesn't change from peer to peer. Right? You just include the whole block. And your peer your will validate, and then it's gonna be the same process to the next year, etcetera. But again, here, you have to trust some notes. Because you have to have some key distributed somehow. So we are not anymore in the don't trust any notes context. So it's a lightweight solution because you share a little bit the load of validation of the chain, but you have to trust some notes. So that's the drawback here."

The drybulk is maybe that you have to configure IP sectors. Everywhere, Right? Yeah. You can love. So, basically, here, it wouldn't be only between IO and notes, it would be between all your notes. Because you cannot re predict what's gonna be your your, endpoint of the tunnel, with IUM because of a lot of reasons. Right? And again, those are the same problems than option 3. Next slide, please. So let me summarize this a little bit. Next slide, please. If we want the protection of IOM data fields and we focus on that as the main goal we probably, as mentioned earlier, we probably want, you know, a full protection and by protection, I mean, You don't trust any notes, so you don't have to share keys in between notes and etcetera. So The only one that matches that is the option 2. Next slide please. Now if you wanna have something lighter, then you could go with either option 3 or 4. You can see on the metrics that they are very similar. So we selected option 4 just because we are lazy, and it's and existing solutions, but, again, option 3 is probably and maybe It's gonna be a little bit, efficient so if the working group feels like we should cover country, as well in the, in the draft, just, speak up.

Exactly. Yeah. He he yes. I I can tell. So appreciate that work. So I mean, overall, I think your proposal here is It it it feels right. Yeah. I agree that option 2 makes the most sense here. With regards To the ipsec option, even if we're mentioning it, I don't have a great sense of this. Like, to what degree there's using IP sec between these nodes also change Yeah.

So stamp would have a pre allocated, MTTLVs as a stem TLVs. And then, on the reflector side, basically, the receive options are copied into those, empty stamp TLs. And send them back to the sender. So, for example, if you collected the IOM, you know, hop by hop, data. This is the way you would reflected would send it back to the sender. So it's it's, like, becomes an active measurement, but m one midpoint note, has no knowledge about this is spam, for example, So this is obstacle behavior. Maybe you don't want to, do the measurement in the reverse direction and then you don't want to put the, accents and headers there as well. So there is some work for that. And next slide, please. So it works the same way for the MPLS data plane. There is a working group recommend for MPLS, extension headers through M and A MPLS network action, and idea is the same, So the packet care is the m and a, stamp would have MT TLVs to, bring the data back from reflector to the sender so the same idea as ipv6.

Thank Greg Murisky, Erickson, I concur with, Thomas that flooding the network, to explore concurrently all available paths might not be a practical approach. So using the entropy, whether it's a flow people or, entropy label or fat, should the wire fed label, seems to be So that's way, you can ensure that first, you can discover all the, multiple paths by using, tracing and, then, use the same, entropy values as your data, for your, measurements. So for IIM, that's not a problem because you are using data pack as your trigger, but you can use the same values, enter the values for, synthetic performance measurements, for example, using stamp. So that's, you know, that you are measuring the same, path as being traversed by their, data packets.

So this, draft is about the proposal to make, supporting IOM, the app's basics more scalable. We all know the IOM is, it's good, technology. There are lots to allows to monitor the, on pass, network performance. By collecting, the datas along the traffic, forwarding paths. In the context of IP ipv6, AUM, trees, option need for help processing. Which means it must be a hold in ipv6 hop by hop extension header. And according to RFC, 8200, ipv6, hop by hop, extension header must be the 1st extension header. Unfortunately, there are, other use cases like, segment routing, which will, apply, routing header, which will be located behind the a whole by whole header. And, if we, try to collect a large amount of the data along the path, which will mix the trees very large. So the, the the first, hop hop extension header will be"

And that's why, in the RFC 94868 proposed to, support the IOM pre allocated trees in hop by hop, extension header, if we use this solution, we have to limit it the size the amount of data we collect per node and also the total, hops we can support So that's a notable And so As SRV 6 becomes more prevalent, you do need to mitigate this problem. That's why, in this draft, we propose, several alternative solutions to make it more scalable The first one is we are actually, we can try to separate as a IOM instruction part and the the data trees part and puts the this part, data part after the all up to the, routing header, because, instruction part is a small, it has small overhead and the fixed fixed size. So it's it's built no to make hope, hope had a very large. And the, so that allow us to access the, routing header easily. And then we use, inc incremental mode instead of, pre allocated mode of AOM, which means we all we are always inserts the new truth data and the fixed location. That's immediately after the, routing header. So that's also very convenient. So the the problem here is where we put this, trace data. We have a 2 proposals, in this draft. One is we just make it a, a TLV option in the routing header."

So this is the first, proposal. The second one, we we call that segment IOM, export. The idea is simple. So, according to based on the hardware, limit we just fixed the the size of, supported tree site, trees data sites, Right? If if we can, for example, if we can only support up to 5 hops data. Then we just allocate pre allocates that amount of, data in the hop hop header. And once we reach that limit, So we force the data to be exported Then we clear the data fields and which means, in the next half, you can start over again to to collect the data. For the next, in hops. So by by doing this, we can always keeps, or had a small and a fixed And another, equivalent to alternative solutions, if we use this with SRV 6, which means, and each segment endpoint node, we will need to access rogging header. But before we reach that, we may already collect, a lot of trees data in the hop hop header. How do we do that? And we we will force and each segment endpoint note, we will force the exports the all the collect data so far. And then we clear that field and then now we can access the running header. And then in the next IP, router hop, you can start to communicate the data again. So by doing this, we can also Make sure it's a"

If that passes a very long, still even in my meets some scalability issue. So And in the drop to be also compared with another solutions, we can try to just, reuse the IOM direct export mode described in Rfc9486. That's a postcard mode, but it's not like the trees mode. But we all know the truth postcard mode has a own issues. And, so here, we are talking if if we just want user trees mode.

First of all, thank you very much for raising this point. I'm sharing your concern that on applicability of IOM trace option type in savis6. I think this is valid work.

Greg Mursky, Erickson, again, I I second, Thomas, that thank you for your analysis and highlighting this issue of scalability. And, possible, cost of using pre allocated incremental.

So that simplifies Also, as I'm aware of some proposals that, simplify correlation, on orchestrator. Or, ah, collector. Actually, if we look at architecture of being the, for their, large scale, access, networks, there was a, used to be a group lmap, and they worked on, informational model for, measurements in our scale, access networks. So where they designed, that you have collector, which collects all the measurement results.

And later, they can make some network optimization So, And what cloud vendors can do is to, Divive deployed the customer experience from some basic network KPIs. Like latency, and packet loss and treats her and such KPIs are assessable, to them And so let's go of this work is to propose a unified evaluating method of network experience. For cloud applications. And we can see that currently no single KPI can provide accurate reflection of the experience for diverse service. Because layout could be some latency sensitive or some, bandwidth sensitive applications and they could follow into different categories and need different KPIs. And another challenge is that there is no unified evaluation method, for some experience quality. Currently. And so we proposed the master, and we observe from as curve as curve is in this speaker.
