Thank you Thanks, Mahesh and maybe a couple of additions from the chair still on this we of course agree with the sentiments outlined there But yeah, maybe the main thing is concrete over fussy let's let's do something that we can actually achieve also there's a lot of sustainability-related topics. We don't have to do all of them in one working group. In fact, that's probably harmful. So if we have ideas that are sort of beyond what is being discussed today, let's say something about route or other designs, we can form other working groups for that at later time or even during the IETFs And we have other places in the IETF for discussion of broader sustainability topics, for instance, the E E-Impact program of the IAB discusses many topics that are not yet ready for IETF process. So keep those things in mind, and it would be good to start with something that we can build on so have some foundations that enable other things to be built on top later and also I mean it's really up to this room or the virtual room to decide what to do. We'll this discuss a number of different topics today It can be useful to think of that set of topics as a list of things, and we don't have to agree on the whole list of things.

You can find a multitude of data about consumption and so, so there are a lot of statistics and figures. We drop one of them on the slide but the final message is that somehow we are increasing the consumption and energy and we need to take some action on that front so in that respect there are different actions on climate change in different operators driving organizations like GSM or NGMN and Amazon others. You can see, for instance, there are climate change in different operators driving organizations like GSM or NGMN and Amazon others. You can see, for instance, an example on the right side of this slide about some indications from GSM about the relevance of MET measuring energy efficiency and so.

What could be considerations to bring here to the both? so that it can serve as input so as you saw before, there are inputs from so many people so many organizations from different geographies so in some cases, the inputs are more specific, more concrete and some others are a little bit more back. But basically, take it as an input of what are the concerns? from the operator's side in this in this respect so we are more specific, more concrete, and some others are a little bit more back. But basically take it as an input of what are the concerns from the operator's side in this respect. So with that, we structure in operation considerations. So attending to the cycle of observability analysis observability of the consumption let's say and analysis of the data, and then control and management based on that analysis previously performed and also we will cover some considerations before operations so how much carbon is before operation in our networks. Important to take into consideration as well as the accuracy of the data that we could play with at the end the data is expected to be used for taking decisions so accuracy could be a dimension as well that we need somehow to take into consideration. So I will go through the in-operation part and starting with observability some of the inputs collected are what I will go quickly one by one. So first one was about having more granular information the more granular information that we have the better so having information per line per port per card so trying to collect as much as much as we can from the devices, from the network elements. Also, improvement of the metering solutions So having this granularity interoperability, ways of exposing information, and so on so far.

So, for instance, the common definition of energy efficiencies, so having a common ground a common language for all of us to understand what we are talking about when we refer to energy efficiency, having as well a common methodology so in such a way that we can fairly compare consumption between different implementations, between different network scenarios, between different architectures also important how to provide accurate figures So what is the specific context of the measurement in terms of the period, the time of period? that we use for having that mission? specific context of the measurement in terms of the period, the time of period that we do, we use for having that measurement, the location, the traffic conditions, and so on so far Also, the possibility of consistency databases so that we can accumulate measurements that could be used later on for taking decisions. An example of that could be large data transfer, so maybe we can accommodate data transfer according to the spec historical consumption and the expected consumption the prediction. And then also, important the multilayer analysis so maybe not the stay only one single layer, but considered multiple layers in the networks we have today in the architecture and example would be the IP plus the on top of the optical layer Then moving to the control and management input, some idea so on interest, rather than ideas Some interest that we would have to consider is to have the devices with elastic power consumption so that we can the consumption could be accommodated according to the traffic that is being delivered supporting"

But there are other aspects that also could be are of interest definitely and this could apply in some cases to in operation stage but also in some other cases to be for operation stage For instance, the inventory, having an inventory, of all the power components, of devices, the racks so it's not only the network equipment, but also how the racks are being fit with the energy, and so optimization and control capabilities, nominal conditions usage and so on so far. Additionally to that, the possibility of optimizing the overall CO2 footprint.

This is power utilization of high-end fixed router As you can see, the NPUs consume the most amount of power in this particular instance the NPUs are 41%, optics are about 20 router. As you can see, the NPUs consume the most amount of power. In this particular instance, the NPUs are 41%, optics are about 26%, and the fabric is 11% The key point here, the NPU are the dominant factor If you're not optimizing the NPUs, you're not playing it right Next slide, please This also takes a look at the similar figures for high-end modular routers. These are ones that have multiple line cards in them. As you can see, the line cards consume 40 look at similar figures for high-end modular routers. These are ones that have multiple line cards in them. As you can see, the line cards consume 49%, 51% of the power That's where the power goes. Optic 18 to 22% The fabric is non-trivial, 18 to 19% But again, it's a distant third The key point I also wanted to make here power utilization is very much a function of traffic volume and distribution Sending big packets is different than sending small packets Sending a lot of traffic is very different than sending no traffic. Ambient temperature also makes a big difference If the ambient temperature is high, the fans have to work a lot harder That draws more power. Altitude also can counts. If you're in Denver, your router is going to consume more power than if you were in Miami If you're trying to make a comparison between two routers, you must control all of the same variables to ensure you're making an apples to app"

Next slide, please Looking at the line card, again, the line card is completely dominated by NPUs. 76% of the power is going on a line card is going direct to the NPUs, another 4% of that is the memory associated with those NPUs So that is the key thing to turn off Next slide This graph shows the effect of traffic load this is back on the fixed form factor system, and as you can see, at zero load, that system is consuming 635 watts of power just for the NPUs. As those are see at zero load that system is consuming 635 watts of power just for the NPUs as those NPUs are loaded the power can sum ramps up, and that only grows by 95 watts Again, if you're trying to optimize, try to optimize out the six watts. Yes, you can play games but you're only going to advertise you're only going to optimize the 95 watts by doing route games. So think hard about how to turn off NPUs. That's our first order of business Next slide I was asked to talk about reporting. Right now, the number one way we report about power, numbers on a data sheet. That is what people ask for because they care mostly about provisioning Second, there's always comments about what actual typical utilization is that usually goes through our support channels, talking to your salesperson We have not implemented any what actual typical utilization is. That usually goes through our support channels, talking to your salesperson. We have not implemented E-Man.

Jeff, Invidia, what optics did you use to measure this? There were a variety of optics used here Obviously, you can slant the numbers any which way by choosing your eye optics. So ZTAR Plus uses 23 watt piece. So if you populate 48 of those in line cards, suddenly you jared mauch over your NPR. Isn't it? Yes there are line cards that have power limits, so you have to be work within those power limits And again, you have to be careful which optics you're choosing If you're doing everything with ZR, you might have a problem. Practicing will be useful to either normalize optics across ranges or the power consumption is very different, right? If you're trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison, yes, you need to optimize the normalize the optics. Thank you Hi, Curtis So I was just at an NSF workshop on sustainability a little while ago, and I think one of the things I got out of that was these kind of operations power usages are dominated by the manufacturer costs in terms of total lifespan for this, something like 90-10, 90% of it being the manufacturer 10% of it being the runtime things Should this be a focus? Like it seems like even then we're at like 42% is the NPUs, which you kind of that down and it's not going to have that large of an impact on the overall power budget. And then in that consideration of the manufacturing cost as well. So these slides do not include the manufacturing cost? This is just operational cost. But just that consideration of the manufacturing costs as well. So these slides do not include the manufacturing cost? This is just operational cost.

One kilowattoms consumed at night in Ohio is different from one kilowatt consumed in California during the day, right?

That's energy, overall energy consumption measured in kilowatt hours, the estimated cost, the estimated emission, and also energy intensity as well as energy mix of the local grid We're working with third-party data vendors to actually collect this for the local grid, and of course we offer mechanisms for customers who are"

And in the end, they are picked this statement So from the charter, it says, it said, power and energy monitoring, power states, power control, potential power state transitions the framework will focus on energy management for action IP-based network equipment At that time, we're thinking about routers, switches, but also the host the PC, the camera at C etc From the requirement, it says accounting for total power receiving provided by an entity, an network of a service. And we were can of evasive on the entity thing.

Why did we have the entity? MIP in an EMAN working group simply? because we added a single field, the UU the entity MIP. Why did we have the entity MIP in an EMAN working group? Simply because we added a single field, the UUID. If you know the entity MIP, there is an ID which is local to the box for line card for interface. But now if you want to take care of the energy globally, maybe you need to a EUID which is unique for the entire network It might be easier. This is the same discussion we're having these days with Yang. I need to have unique ideas to do the inventory in IV to the digital map and MOP. So, we could be taking the one from the hardware yang module or the one from the topology module with network ideas with link ID, with node ID, etc The context MIP module we were foreseeing at a time that we could control the entire network and depending on the role, on the importance, on the keyword, we could just set the power control, you know, of all the lights off because it's a day off or the IP phones coming up at 7 a.m in the morning, thing like that.

So what we did is that we had the list on the right that was like somehow you know, the starting from the I-T-E and adding some of the MTF one thing I want to stress is, if you go on the right-hand side, the E-Man 1 one from the Ianna from let's say seven to high, 7 to 11, we don't specify like this is the feature of green routing let's say 7 to 11, we don't specify like this is the feature of, you know, green routing or green source, whatever they are generic it means that we foresaw the at some point in time for whatever feature you want to have with a mapping to one of those power states as opposed to create a new power state for every single new feature that you might want to have, proprietary or not something i want to stress, which I have not seen discussed so far, is that typically you have some entities that might be controlling the poor state from other entities typically POE, right? You have a port, you provide power over Ethernet to something else which might have power states right? So the power distribution view is different that the networking view that we have. So that's why we had to introduce the notion of power interface as a consequence And that's why we had to introduce the relationships over there, like powered by powering, metered by, metering aggregating, and thing like this So I've not seen that working discussed here"

I would agree for that I would agree with that. Now, there are implementation There is one at Cisco. You have to ask Cisco where the status is in the school requests for EMAN. I would agree for that. I would agree with that. Now, there are implementation, there is one at Cisco, you have to ask Cisco where this is, and it's called EnergyWise. We had some smart PDU vendors involved there Now, my view of all this is that, first of all, it was not such a success because the energy crisis, did not last too long at that point in time So, the interest was there heavily to do monitoring. And then because the energy costs went down, people say, oh yeah, maybe not a high priority to control things. It might be different this time So we might have the same of the same requirements, but with some different incentives Then I went so this is my view I want to some operators and I asked them, okay, so we could, for example, shut down a line cart if there is no traffic and we've seen the numbers from Tony, right? But then there was like, oh, so you asked me to pay for an expensive secondary line card that you want be you want right? But then there was like, oh, so you asked me to pay for an expensive secondary line card that you want to be off. And it takes 40 seconds to boot So I have an issue with the SLA I pay for that, but right now I can't have a redundancy Then we went into the campus and we were thinking to, we could have algorithm to shut down ports based on the traffic but you know, a port was like 10 watts, so is this one?"

We're more time targeted to network operator to manage larger scale mobile networker, data center network backbone network with explosive growth of network traffic and rapid development of network technologies such a 5G AI computer So network capacity and site is continuing increase and the AI computing network infrastructure consume much more energy. So which drive tremendous growth of equipment energy consumption costs. In the meanwhile, large proportion of vast amount of energy to be consumed is unnecessarily wasted. Therefore, more and more network operators, thinking for the automation tools, solution to better assess and control energy consumption for the whole network.

However, the power consumption morning on network device is not sufficient, since the monitoring only tell you how much power are consumed but doesn't tell you when and where, why it consumes so much energy. And what a matter, we can take to reduce this energy consumption Therefore, to tackle the challenging energy efficiency, the margin has already become the trend and which allow network operator to optimize energy usage based on discovered capability In the meanwhile, to improve overall network utilization A second slide Yeah. To support energy vision, say, observability and management, we believe actually at least four functionality should be support Function number one, capability, identity, inventory which allowed net or abider to discover what capability can be supported by specific network device with specific identity. Function number two, power consumption, monitoring, in addition to report basic energy consumption, we also care about time-based location-based energy consumption environment Function number three, energy efficiency monitoring, which allow network operator to use new metric to measure energy efficiency and also looking for the balance between the power consumption and net performance Function number three, optimization and control"

As for the capability, identity, inventory, first we should acknowledge the dependency between the thing, component, device, network is complete For example, there's dependency relationship among a set of components. You cannot tune component X because, you know, Y depends on it and for function F. Also, there's some power relationship across device, for example, or which network device using which power interface to provide power, and which network device to consume power which power source will be used, whether it's solar energy or wind energy. And virtualization allow much multiple instances of components, which really compound to describe the relation between the things, components device. Therefore, it's very important to really discover these complex relationship and associate capability. This capability can be brought down to three categories. With number power in the to really discover these complex relationship and associate capability. This capability can be brought down to three categories. With number power interface, static capability, typical example is nominal voltage, power settings supported by power interface. Second category is component specific capability. We don't have port component we have fan component, fan component, you know the speed adjustment port can be on off to switch to save the power. And for component independent capability, for example, we support various different number of the power state.

Typical metric, for example, power usage effects, we call the P PUE, and we also have some other metric like you know, cooling load factor, power load factor Take a PUE example, which can be detailed by, you know, the energy entering into the data center by the energy to run the IT device, like a switch router Another example is power gain, actually, which can be determined by the actual power consumption by the maximum power consumption As for the energy efficiency monitoring, we think we must, you know, support two basic metric. First is, energy proportion. Typically example is we can, you know, report the percentage of power, you know, can consumed by each component like an MPU We also can report a percentage of power consumed by radio networker, data center network Second metric we should, you know, care about is the monitor the trade-out between the performance and the power which can be mayor, you know, using two typical metrics, like mayor using the data traffic per unit or energy consumption, or we can measure using like a cabin emission or netto operation divided by total data traffic. And for energy, if efficient ratio, it's determined by a set of factors for maximum throughput traffic load and therefore it's also important to monitor this factor change In case of energy saving can be switching off and you also need to, you know, the maximum wake-up time and sleep time and mayor, and report it As for optimization and control, and we can support you know, network-wide optimization and localization management.

And to fulfill all these requirements, we think data model technology should be used. Two options we have either use, the MIME model or we use a young data model. MIME has been divided before that decades, good at monitoring, but has limitations for the control functionality. Another is, you know, has a limitation to define complex type and concentrate for correlation, mapping, between various different type of data. But the young doesn't have such a need limitation. Young already have a good ecosystem for network managing automation, which has already been widely adopted by various different SDO and also open source project integration with OSS and SD control is much easy And so what a young data model design look like? We can have two-level young data model network level model we can actually extend from network inventory model and a network-toboji model to support, you know, capability exposed and dynamic metric monitoring We also can extend network inventory model and nanopoji model to describe a dependency relationship capability exposure and dynamic metric monitoring. We also can extend network inventory model and nanopoji model to describe a dependency between the component, device, and network networker.

Robert Hi, so I was slightly gilded of encouraging the proponents to come along and try and start a working group and to have a boff potentially. And the reason I did that was because when I was an AD, now I've released, I saw that it was very was various green related drafts happening in various places and they were struggling to get traction because they weren't really in scope or in charge of any of those working groups and recharging those workers groups to cover those might have been possible but it would have detracted from the core scope and an aimed for those working groups in terms of working for. So I saw these various drafts happening and there was no great home for where they should go and different drafts are happening different places. So I was one of the people who were encouraging to say, no, let's try and create a work group to bring some of the short-term work together that we can do in a short time frame We know what we need to do and get it done.

So I but if you look at the devices out there today, pretty much all devices, most devices can report something about their energy use but what is not standardized is how you collect and combine this data and we need to agree on what should be measured. We already have email that has some good suggestions and we need to agree on how to aggregate and store this data coming from multiple vendors and multiple systems so that we have a common format for combining things thank you And here, Chris Seale. Yeah, it's Chris Seale Well, firstly, I'm in support of this It's just a question really about how we charge this I agree with the short-term aims I'm less sure about excluding the out-of-scope items I mean, unless you want to re-charter. But as well as quality of experience, I would also highlight protocols and algorithms as an area currently out of scope but I would have thought they would have a, at least we should at some point address recommendations. I mean, on those so just to jump back at you would you see that as a staged thing, so do some work and then read? you, would you see that as a staged thing, so do some work and then recharter and pull that in, or do you think it needs to be in from day one? That depends on how easy you regard it to recharter So if it's relatively easy, we can do it later. I don't think I agree with the priority list as it is, it's just the pain of rechartering rechartering"

Second point I suggest to take some security mechanism in account when developing such abscess specifically speaking why applying energy control to the networks? it must be assured that customers' data traffic won't be severely affected if some special events happen Here, the special events include by not limited to protection switch bus traffic and line kind of maintenance, etc. So that's my two points. Thank you Thank you very much Stuart. Yeah, Stu here I am very much in favor of the goals here, but I've got a couple of concerns about assumptions that maybe may be made and resources that may be required So, you know, obvious metrics are going to include things like you know kilowatt hours saved now let's say by putting in one piece of gear as a opposed to another piece of gear, we save one kilowatt hour per month over an operating life of 60 months. We just save 60 kilowatt hour right? But if putting in that piece of gear involved construction, transportation, installation, provisioning, and ultimately decommissioning costs of 100 kilowatt hours more than the other piece of gear, we don't net out We just wasted 40 kilowatt hours, right? Plus a kilowatt"

The competencies required to address this are going to require um expertise in thermodynamics of ecosystems, expertise in thermodynamics of economies These are not expertise as typically found within the IETF. So to get this done, is going to involve recruiting from beyond our usual community. We can understand how to move these metrics around, but understand what metrics to move around goes way beyond IETF competencies Thanks, Dan, no. You've had a go and we have a queue. Suresh Thank you I think like this work should go on here I think we are the right 20 for doing this. We have the right expertise on the Yang side to kind of define the data models and the frameworks and so on I think the operators do a great job collecting like the collective requirements and I think we need to narrow it down because it all looks fascinating and somehow we need to prioritize it which is the part that is the concern is changing so you said that's in scope for the discussion I think we should spend a little bit more effort on it after this meeting to figure out like, you know, what comes first, what comes next. Because I think we need to get something out very very quickly and I think if you can start measuring things quickly, it can help us improve things. So I think that is at least much comment like start doing something quickly i think somebody brought up this thing about a tithoscope or not. I would like a tithoscope get the stuff done. Rechartering is pretty straightforward, like Mahesh will probably say yes to everything you ask after you do the first few deliverables so thank you Thanks, Tim.

They've done a lot of work on assessing what we need to do to towards green activities, and they've come up with a lot of recommendations One of them is certainly around energy measures such as IPMI and all the SNMP stuff that we're aware of in the Yang stuff So I certainly support that. I think it's great. I can't see anyone in the room that would object to that. They also, of course, cover things like looking at the cost of the cooling, the embedded carbon, etc. But I think that's out of scope of what we're doing here But what I would say is I'm sort of seeing two sort of elements of this. One is the measurement and monitoring and management side of green and then there's a sort of a kind of a ops a more operational side where you might come up with things like carbon aware routing, more active things that you can do. So maybe that's a separate activity a separate working group even, and we should focus on the measurement monitoring management here because that's the base baselining and understanding of the position we're in and being able to control the devices, but not, I would say to initially do the other stuff, maybe a separate working group somewhere else or something parallel Thank you. Ali Thanks. Thanks very much I support the I also have some questions like one of them is to quantify if possible what the effort or resources it would take to implement these measurements What does it cost to measure? Because it has to also fit into a certain budget? And also we said, baselining and target value setting is out of scope but we have to be also mindful of demonstrating the usefulness"

We have to give an idea about this so that people will be willing to implement these And for me also one of the priority areas that this would be helpful is to tell us where in the network we should focus our operations efforts by measuring we will understand like here is where we can focus Should I improve BGP energy efficient? or should I go after I don't know other domains like carbon-aware routing or is it worth doing this? So it's really critical to get data from the network about energy but we also, as I said, need to focus on the costs And during this process, I saw a gap between what the operators are asking and what the charter includes So somehow, perhaps that to be covered with prioritization as Suresh was saying. Thanks Great Lan Great. Deng Wan.

And joe clarke, Cisco I'll echo with a little bit of an ops EW hat on echo with some of the things Rob said, we had work presented in ops AWG around green It didn't, unfortunately, that's my personal opinion, gain the traction that I would it had. So I support the formation of this group I think it will concentrate in interest, and that's a good thing I would also be willing to participate in it. Now, scope I think, and we've heard a few, comments around this, a tight scope is useful for a couple of reasons. One, we didn't see a lot of email implementations, and I think maybe it's because regionally even today, regionally, the need for energy management is probably not the same I think maybe in Europe, it's higher than in the U.S for example. So I think we do need to be very prescriptive of what we want vendors to implement. And I think the scope around getting the consumption, so let's make what's out there first, and then having some basic controls for the option to decide what they want to turn on or off. I think that's the right first approach. And then I think from there, we can iterate on what comes next. What is a higher priority? And I like, I think Tim said, some of these things might happen in other working groups. So I think this tight scope is the right answer in my opinion thanks Stay there a moment. Joe I just wanted to check out of that because one of the questions here is about over with other working groups or should this work be in other working groups and I think I heard you say not ops I get why OpsAWG wasn't the right fit.

So I think the reason we didn't see this traction is because people are used to seeing a broader scope of topics in ops AWG, and we've got enough, I would say, critical mass now to pull this stuff out concentrate the interest in a working group like Green and get things happening. Thank you I don't know So I believe this is important work to be done Now, one question I have in mind head is that, assuming that we would build in done. Now, one question I have in my head is that, assuming that we would build Iman now just with Yang, would it be a good? fit for operators? So I don't want to have a number now on this, but trying to think one needs to be done in his working group, right? First of all, we need to move to Yang. That's a given. Formal monitoring, this is a given. For control, I guess the time is right. I say guess because we all want to control things, but in the end, maybe shall we do it? We'll see. Now, I believe that we're going to arrive to many concepts that are defined in the EMAN framework. So instead of redoing EMAN, I propose that you look at the requirements first and I think like Suresh mentioned, only one or two use cases because if you cover everything you're going to have something that will be as big as Eman and to answer the first question if you had Eman now with Yang, would that be the right solution? a good fit, maybe another kill? And anyway, Yang could be augmented, right? So we could go step-by-step So maybe what you want to have in Eman minus pruning you know, the battery, pruning maybe the context pruning all of these things.

But we can provide the needed basic elements, units, that is we can provide the needed basic elements, units, that the other people can use. For example, I have them. So there is like energy consumption you know, per bit And this is one of the standard as units that the industry is using to calculate the other stuff. Or the has been also proposal to do the energy efficiency rating for network equipment. You have energy efficiency rating for different um tools like boilers, you know, TVs And if we could adopt that and say, here's the energy efficiency rating for routers or switches, some people would be able to use it for their own calculations calculations So I will put out a draft after this that will talk about what current units the industry is talking about, and then we can put it into the perspective what we should do but let's take baby steps and make sure that we can provide basic information that the people who are trying to calculate much larger pictures because there's also say they're saying how we can do carbon usage effectiveness We cannot provide them that, but we can provide them the needed"

I think the charter is in pretty good shape So I'd say generally speaking in the contours of what's there I like that. It's scoped pretty well.

Thank you you Thank you. Allie again. I forgot the last time. So one question I have is about the deployment strategy. So can that be part of the scope of the working group? How? would these metrics be deployed? and how would they scale? So we have to have a strategy of implementation. That's what I want to make sure And for example, there are rather than implementing all the metrics on all the network elements would something like, probes be more practical like measurement probes? of these, and that kind of different alternative thinking how would this scale?

I mean, I think that's overall helps. And just, I mean, it's, and it's really kind of across the board, across the industry, but now that's coming into like the networking realm. So, but having the metrics, it really helps actually the option not only I just want to imagine not only for being green but also determining what you're cost, but what your, overall budget and your over cost cost far as your overall data center footprint let's say, and how much your cost is overall especially even if you're moving workloads from the cloud to, you know, the data to your on-prem to off-prem or vice versa There are many ways you can actually use these metrics and not just for reducing a carbon footprint, which is I think that's probably the primary goal, but these metrics can be used in a lot of different ways for accounting there's so many different accounting things that aspects, that having these metrics can be extremely viable for, you know, determining our topics and optics and how you can reduce the optics.

But also there was a number of higher level issues What's the quality of experience or the impact on that? or comparing you know power usage and what you actually get out of it and whether we go into the carbon aspects of the energy and whether we go into even other things, not directly related to the use phase so embedded carbon for instance or life cycle in general, what's the cost of measuring?
