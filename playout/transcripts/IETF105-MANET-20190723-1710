    "text": "that\u0027s the next slide i may be reading too much into better that question about you know it\u0027s focusing it on one particular multicast group at a time but if I\u0027m not reading too much into your comment or question whichever it was then there is a need-to-know argument here that goes to both scalability and privacy issues if there are a number of nodes that need to know that I\u0027m listening on a particular multicast group they do not all necessarily need to know all of the multicast groups that I am listening on so I\u0027m assuming that this is operating inside a single routing domain a single control domain and routing protocols you tend to push around the information of you know at least who your next hops are maybe not everyone in the network and that\u0027s what that\u0027s just what we\u0027re doing here so in terms of privacy I don\u0027t think the privacy is any different than the routing protocol and any other domain in terms of scalability this is has different scalability properties than you would have on a traditional land but I think the problem is is you\u0027re not on a traditional land and so your protocols are designed to operate on artificial land and make assumptions you\u0027re they\u0027re gonna assume that there\u0027s delivery in the case that there\u0027s not and so your since you\u0027re dealing with this I\u0027ll see medium you have to accommodate it and that\u0027s what this is all about this is Stan again I\u0027d like to go back to the the example you were talking about earlier where you were on a deal up subnet you can see Rick as a router you can see me but you can\u0027t see student and you\u0027re trying to figure out as a sender how to how to cope with that well I said I couldn\u0027t reach him for multicasts right I mean that\u0027s said he might be show up as an endpoint for unicast yeah and if this is contrived and doesn\u0027t make sense from your favorite radio technology I accept that because I\u0027m not a radio guy I am making this up I admit it okay I wouldn\u0027t know I was just gonna say that that seems to me like the it\u0027s a problem that has to be solved that you the sender it\u0027s kind of like the classic hidden terminal problem right it\u0027s not your problem to solve it\u0027s mine and Rick\u0027s to realize that students back there and he can\u0027t hear so we\u0027ve got to propagate forward wait and so let\u0027s change it let\u0027s let\u0027s change the topology you guys are in front of me over there right so you can\u0027t solve the problem either well if he\u0027s over there far enough that you can\u0027t see him or you can\u0027t hear no idea you\u0027re blind I hear - a unicast "
