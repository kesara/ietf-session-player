Danny your presentation yeah cover for your notes right okay next slide just reminder some history this draft well went through workup last call about a little bit more than a year ago and at some point Suresh we called it back to merge with another draft that was written by Ceylon we did that and since then we got some good comments about this review and as a result added sample code and change the socket API that we were using due to some concern about the blocking nature of the call we did all that in the last face-to-face we basically had one comment about asking to modify the word code to pseudocode "
