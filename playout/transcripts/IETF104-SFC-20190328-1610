    "text": "one of the drafts we adopted since the last meeting is the IETF SFC service ID header draft there was some name confusion with it but we adopted it we know which draft we mean and it specifies a couple of TL B is for subscriber identifiers it still uses 8300 and it lacks integrity protection some med was wondering reasonably should he be addressing the integrity protection in the context of his specific TL fees and if we don\u0027t have a working group approach that it crosses tlvs and protects multiple pieces of metadata then we have to go and look at protection for each individual TL v instead and that seems to me to be a very painful path to go down but he asked us to bring up up this issue to the working group I gathered he couldn\u0027t be here even though we\u0027re in Europe this time and he\u0027s in France we all have trouble travelling even short distances periodically so we wanted to call attention he is asking for feedback from the working group on this particular topic and that this is a subtopic of a much bigger topic for the working group as a whole does anybody want to comment on this either the general or the specific as I expected bring up Donald\u0027s presentation here\u0027s the clicker the rush hi there i\u0027m donald east like so when i talked about this fairly recently adopted working group draft on ACN support using the network service header so goals vcn are to collect congestion information and in this case with the condition information is within a service function changing domain and to do that by method by a method of marking in the frame is rather than by just noticing that packets have been dropped if you drop packets they typically have to retransmit them and so forth for quality causes things less to be less efficient than if you can avoid the congestion in some other way and so the the way it\u0027s implemented also if you happen to have end-to-end ECM so that the service domain service function changing domain as part of that then it contributes to collection of congestion "
