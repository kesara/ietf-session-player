There is a lot more information there and the IETF in particular has been doing a lot of work updating the website and trying to make it more user-friendly and more accessible So please feel free to take a look at that information that will be immediately useful to you during your first IETF and not everything that you need to know about the IETF. It does not cover the history of the IETF. There is also a lot of information about that There's also a series of present from Scott Bradner that you can find on YouTube and on the IETF channels that can give you some additional information about the history of the IETF. It does not cover how to write a standard, and it does not cover many, many things. This is really just to get you started So the first thing is that you will see this quite a bit throughout the week this is the IETF note well you agreed to this when you registered for the meeting. All of your participation in the IETF is governed by a set of processes and rules and expectations about behaviors. So if you have additionally, if you have any questions about this, please feel free to ask"

You can use a slim client on your phone that allows you to get in the queue and get out of the queue and to register your attendance, or you can use the full client, whether you're remote or even if you're in the room if you want to follow along with what's visually happening. If you have done so, this is sort of a test. Everybody scan your QR code register yourself for the meeting As a reminder, you will need a Datatracker account today of a test. Everybody scan your QR code, register yourself for the meeting. As a reminder, you will need a Datatracker account to do that. You needed a Datatracker account to register for the meeting meeting And if you have any questions or comments, we can see now that I actually can't see the statistics but how many do we have our comments, we can see now that, I actually can't see the statistics, but how many, do we have, is our number increasing? Does it look like we have roughly? In this room? In this room? We have about 50 excellent so we have about 50 people that are registered so it looks like most of you were able to do that successfully There is a session following this that is a more detailed Meetecho presentation that goes into all of the various things to help you get to use Meetecho more effectively"

And then this is matthew quick how to ask a question in a session as a result of going through the pandemic and since then we have really tried to equalize remote participation with in-person participation And so the chairs of a session, and in this case, it's the three of us manage what's called the queue. And in order to join the queue, you raise your hand. And so you can see the hand symbol right there. So you push that to join the key queue, and then you push it to get out of the out of the queue queue of the queue. And with that, the next thing that these are, this basic first part is all administer things that help you physically in the meeting You will see lanyards and buttons and pins and dots and all of these things have a meeting. But there is somebody in the queue. Does Lucas have a question? Nope, Lucas got out of the queue. He's practicing to test the button So with that, there's two colors, lanyards. It's red and white this time, right? We did. So white is these have to do with photography and photographic permissions. If you do not wish to have your picture taken, in an individualized way group shots, you've already agreed to have your picture taken but if you do not want your picture taken, individually then we do usually have a cameraman on site and wear a red lanyard If you're wearing a white lanyard, it means basically you have agreed to be in pictures. Pins These also grew out of the pandemic. There's a the green triangle the green square the yellow triangle and the red septagon octagon, it's not eight"

Language buttons and we've already seen a few of them in here. There's a whole set of language buttons there If you speak another language, feel free to put a button on, indicate which languages you can communicate with. And these are all ways to make you better integrated, better, you know attached to the community and find the right people to chat with. All right So the first section is the overview of the IETF The mission of the IETF, which is, is to make the internet better And it's basically do that by developing high quality, relevant, technical documents that impact the way we design, use, and manage the internet Anyone can participate? All of the work is available for free Contributions are judged primarily on technical merits and success We have no authority as the IETF to mandate people implement or not implement things. So success is determined by adoption and deployment of the standards. That's why in particular we're interested in feedback from operators and trying to get operators into the community also feedback from developers if you are part of the hackath for the last two days, you saw some of that So what is the IETF? The IETF is first and foremost a standards development organization You are basically at self-selecting individual participants, so there's no formal membership there's no pay-to-play type of thing It's driven by market-based adoption Governments and other entities can take standards and make them required in their context but the IETF does not mandate standards"

It's the resource to actually operate not just the meeting the physical meetings in person, but all of the infrastructure and all of the support that happens all year round and all of the tools and all of the staffing and all of that It comes from a number of sources, the registration fees for this month meeting make up only a small portion of it there's also donations individual donations there are corporate contributions and there's a number, you'll see a number of different categories here that different companies have sponsored things there up passionate about. Also the Internet Society the IETF LLC, the organization that represents the IETF is a subsidiary of ISOP and ISOC has a long-term agreement to which is currently funding over 50% of the IETF. Generally speaking if you go to the plan area on Wednesday evening, a lot of the administrative details and budget and status and all of those kinds of things are reported out in that session. So the IETF is not a pay-to-play type of SDO and there's no mechanism to buy any sort of formal role role Organizationalally this is the big picture for the IETF The vast majority of it here is the IESG, the Internet Engineering Steering Group, and all of the work"

So that's your leadership structure structure Next is the Internet Research Steering Group and the IRTF, which is the research portion. So the engineering work is done in the IETF, the research work is done in the IEF and the leaders of each of those sets of groups are the steering groups associated with them. There's an internet architecture board which does general architecture and strategy discussions for the IETF and they also maintain all of the IETF's external relations So any liaisons that we have with other organizations for you know, like the IEEE or ITU or anything like that, all of those liaisons and those liaison relationships are managed through the IETF through the IAB, the Internet Architecture Board And then finally, there's the administrative LLC So the LLC does all of the work to manage the contracts for the IETF. They sign the contracts for all of the staffing, and they do the funding and the budgeting and all of the business aspects of the IAT All of these groups will be reporting out in the context of Wednesday's planning of the business aspects of the IETF.

We did mention that the IETF is a consensus-based organization The old saying from from years ago is we reject kings presidents in voting, we believe in rough consensus and running code. There is an RFC, RFC 72, 82, which just describes rough consensus for the IETF IETF It's achieved when all of the issues are addressed but not necessary accommodated. So we hear the dissenting opinions, but they don't necessarily stop the work. There are a number of ways to measure consensus There's Meetecho polls and a polling tool that's built into media Meetecho. There's also hand-raising consensus sometimes be used. Humming is sometimes used. These are ways to measure consensus in a room and they're not necessarily voting. If you've participated in I I-EE, for example, I-3802, I know I've done a lot of work there. There's an actual, you have voting members in the vote members vote on things. That's not done here It's the session chair is responsible for determining consensus. Consensus also is generally for a working group gone back to the mailing list. So it's not just the people that are physically in the room or physically online for the meeting, but most major consensus calls also involve participants"

And then it has descriptions of each working group. So if you go to the Datatracker and you look at a working group page, you can find things like, you know, about, and about will tell you the name of the working group and who the co-chairs are currently and any additional resources that they might have like a GitHub repo or things like that are all listed on the Datatracker page so review the page to see if you're if it's work that you're interested in, and then if it is you can join the mailing list Review the documents that are currently in progress and if you go to the documents tab you can see all of the current working group adopt documents that they're ongoing all of the rfc documents that are currently in progress, and if you go to the documents tab, you can see all of the current working group adopted documents that they're ongoing, all of the RFCs that that working group has published, and any individual contributions that have been submitted but not necessarily adopted by the working group So you can see, you can distinguish between the things that the working group as a whole has agreed to work on Those are working group documents versus the by the working group. So you can see, you can distinguish between the things that the working group as a whole that has agreed to work on. Those are working group documents versus things that people have contributed And if you have any questions you can always contact the chairs of the working group and they'll get back to you with answers on that So, oftentimes, not always, but a lot of times, people that are new participants to the IETF come because they are interested in how work, you know, they've something that they wish to contribute and they want to know how to do that"

You need to come to the IETF with a problem and I think I have a solution and let's work on solving that problem And then once you've figured out that you have a problem, you want to make sure that that problem fits within the scope of the IETF and that aligns with the architectural principles of the energy and also, is the scope well defined? If it's not well defined, it might be research work. And otherwise, then maybe it is ready for the engineering process And you need to find willing people to do that work with you. So you need to have some collaborators There is a whole new web page that's been built up that talks about the new work process It's new since the last IETF. I think it does a really nice job of detailing how work gets started in the IEDA So if you're interested in that at all, I strongly suggest you take a look at that link But the basic steps are you know, is this within the scope of the IETF? Then you need to write an internet draft. If you're interested in writing an internet draft, probably I meant to add this link and I forgot, but you need to document your ideas. And to do that, you would write an internet draft There is an entire wiki page called Author Authors.IETF.org and that wiki page will tell you everything you need to know to get started to write an internet draft with the tooling because the tooling is a little bit different and then you need to socialize your participation with your contract with other IETF participants and find collaboration and feedback.

Okay, so the IETF is divided into working groups. We have about 130 or so They don't all meet during this week I think we have like 70 meeting or something like that. There is also a birds of a feather sessions which are informal or someone is from the phrase birds of a feather flock together, careful I say that um and it has to do with well i'm thinking of doing something about, what does it mean to do? TCP in deep space, for example? So people who are interested in doing that would get together and meet, sometimes they need a the bar, sometimes they meet in a side meeting.

They come here, they have site visits beforehand, but they come here the week before and set up if you see all around the hallways and so on, these chairs with these little, you know Wi-Fi connectors, they do that We get a lot of donated equipment The last IETF was in Australia So if sometimes you bring up like Google Map and it thinks you're in Sydney it's because the network numbers haven't changed to match the"

It's sort of lag sometimes But anyhow, Doc is great If you have any problems about network connectivity, it doesn't see to be working for you or so on email to support at IETF.org They'll open a ticket and things will be handled and addressed very quickly I remember one time when we met in and the network is named IETF Pretty simple. If you need a password, it's IETF So it's open access We met in Montreal once some people were walking through one of the hallways in the the underground shopping centers and the woman goes, I don't know what, where the IETF hotel is, but boy do they have good Wi-Fi Medico, that's the spoken tool, custom tool we use for the remote participation If you haven't scanned on your phone, the QR code, do that because it's important to get the participation counts It's also important that everyone gets registered for to make sure there's no patent issues or intellectual property coming up that might be a problem. So you agree the note well, which was been, will have been presented a few times every, at the beginning of every session, explains what your rights and your requirements are And so the Meetecho signing up through that gives us planning for next time and also agreement to abide by the rules The Datatracker datatracker.IETF.org It's also a DNS alias dttt.IETF.org I type that all the time.

There are some what's called knob non-working group mailing lists. For example, there was the school but enthusiasts. I forget what else. There is the system mailing lists. We have discussions, general working groups. There are some what's called non-working group mailing lists. For example, there was the school but enthusiasts. I forget what else.

So, for example, one dash new participants. Everyone should have been trying to that if they were a new participant. Everything else, you can see the link at the bottom These slides are available if you look for the newcomers tutorial in the Datatracker, you can get the hard copy of the slides or the soft copy and then start clicking on links directly Zulip is our chat server, instant messaging system analogous to Slack or thing, but better There was a Zulip section that's describes it. It's integrated with the AV component of Meetecho, so you can see the chat room Everything is web-oriented"

I'm the one who's been sending you lots of emails. Rich said, about six, but it has grown since I've taken over to the program because of requests to remind people about the information and as people register at different times you know, some register two months prior to the meeting some people register a day before the meeting, try to make sure we get all that information to you So I'm just going to briefly talk about the new participant activities here at 120 We have this session as the overview. It is going to be available in the proceedings. So if you need to refer back to any other session as the overview. It is going to be available in the proceedings. So if you need to refer back to any of this information, it's going to be available to you Immediately following this session, we will have a Meetecho test session. We're a very informal session. We're just going to be looking at all the buttons you use you can practice join in the queue And even people who are joining remotely, not in this room, welcome to join. And practice, test your audio, test your video just make you a little bit more comfortable with the tool because that's something that you're going to get very used to when joining all of the working group sessions This afternoon, we have what's called quick connection for new participants and it's best described as speed dating but it's where we have a bunch of tables in the room and at each table we put an experience IETF or somebody who's been around and it could be somebody in leadership, it could be a working group chair and then new participants come in and they move from table to table and it gives you an opportunity"

You can ask, hey, what working groups do you think I should? go to because this is what I'm interested in? Or really it's just a chance to make some very quick connections. Networks a little bit, and your fellow new participants will also be there. It is a sign up event, and that's just due to limited space of the room It was full as of right before the session started, but if you come on by and we feel like the space is going to be enough, you might be able to just jump in started, but if you come on by and we feel like the space is going to be enough, you might be able to just, you know, jump in and we can pitch you in Another thing that we do is we have a new participant dinner, which happens on Monday night The dinner this time around is going to be in the hotel this is not an IETF sponsored event it's something the Secretariat puts on And you can purchase a ticket. We just added a couple more spots a couple hours ago So if you were looking to join and it was sold out we have a couple more spots to fill And it's a it's just a chance there's no there's no presentations. It's really just to network and meet your fellow new participants enjoy a meal and so yeah, if you're interested, please join us And then on Thursday, we have a social hour in the early evening and we invite the leadership of the IETF to come to that.

And we have this sisters networking the plenary and the sisters lunch. So some of the stuff sessions change from meeting to meeting, depending on what's going on, but we've kind of come up with a regular set and these tend to be the session There was also something called a Petycucha which was like a lightning topic talk, but that actually got canceled if you saw that on the mailing list and they're planning one for Dublin instead And then, of course, if you're still not sure, where to start we we understand a lot of information we're throwing at you. Check out the blog post. greg wood, who's the director of Communications for the IETF, puts together a great document there to point out new talk topics, what's happening, pointing out what working group you might be interested in during the week It's a great place to start.
