    "text": "that\u0027s how 6lo modeled actually the radio domain doesn\u0027t mean that the subnet is that for instance here I just have one of the possible model which is hub and spoke well by the router in the middle can use same prefix to talk prefix be 64 can be used for a and C 2 for matrices and they can all talk together as long as B exposes the prefix as not a link and realized by CAD between a and C so the model that you are used to in in BSS which is Wi-Fi current of this can completely apply in the X news unfortunately or three if you don\u0027t have a layer to BSS we can do it at layer 3 thank you exactly the same model and that\u0027s what we did at 6000 we just reproduced what is known to work well in dot eleven yeah infrastructure mode and we just replicated that at layer 3 Oh last but not least angle of this discussion is can we do everything that we want already with the method we have at layer 3 not exactly there are even for IP wife even based on everything we have at 6lo there are still things which could be improved 6lo mostly country considered devices that don\u0027t remove a lot and well I did cut that in our authors like 15 years ago realized that if I had to tweak nd to get a mobile router to work and the reason is for instance Andy doesn\u0027t tell you if you have to match the pre-flight as you don\u0027t have to match the prefix that the router gives away and the source address that you use so if you\u0027re moving with your radio on and you get a rise as you go and you form address this with all those prefixes that you hear as you go and then you use any of the dresses that you\u0027ve formed to you with any of the routers that you\u0027ve heard about there\u0027s a good chance that the router that you use is gone or doesn\u0027t know the prefix that you\u0027re using and will filter it out so if you if your mobile and and you don\u0027t even have a link layer method to detect the routers you have around which is the case of a CB 4.11 then you probably want to have new things that you do income including matching the address with the router I get this Pio from that router I\u0027m using this source address I\u0027m using that router it\u0027s unusual for Andy it\u0027s not the right thing maybe in some environments it\u0027s it\u0027s pretty much the thing you have to do if you do IP Mobile IP and and part of that game is also how you manage your default router list because maybe this router uses the array interval and and speaks every 100 milliseconds with a new array that\u0027s very good as a layer 3 because that\u0027s how you do the 30 level we can but this was a router speaks every minute but I just heard about it so which one should I use the one that speaks every minute but I just heard all the one that tells me is going to beacon every 100 milliseconds that\u0027s a sort of logic that you have to invent as you go and I did my own like you know alright as long ago when I did those experiments but there is no standard for doing this and probably the wrong saying it appear to work if we want to enable "
