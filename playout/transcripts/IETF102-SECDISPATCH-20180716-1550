Hyde possessor caught this is literally as CWT right you know your entity to them yeah so we actually proposed using the same Ayana registry for the claims as CWT but the reason i wanted to separate it is because we\u0027re actually trying to prove something about something different than CWT is trying to prove and we\u0027re gonna run into issues of like how the keys are provisioned and handled and what they mean the claim sets are going to be different and there\u0027s gonna be a lot of I think a lot of things that are going to be different and I don\u0027t think it makes sense to combine the work yes Steven bang Hart I said a couple quick clarifying questions so the chairs put you guys together you\u0027re standing both up there are these efforts that work together to get to this point did you talk to each other it does the terminology for this there were these like competing we\u0027re gonna toss one of you in the lion\u0027s den after this I\u0027m trying to understand the relationship here and clear to me yeah but we talked in the do it beforehand so okay so maybe you\u0027re open to working in this and I think this is more eat is more of a single thing well rats is more of an effort is there any kind of merged plan here can you guys work on this together is that possible that\u0027s a little bit of what we\u0027re trying to do yeah yeah actually as well this is my fault I guess because being not informed enough when I send out the invite to the rats Bob oh I was friendly and reminded that as they eat off I was like Oh interesting so there\u0027s beforehand so yeah but the scope is different because you\u0027re deliberately trying to be an extension and being used by multiple things and we are trying to scope the multiple things that belong into the ITF and we have a set of protocols like time-based piercings and challenge-response pairs yang modules reference interaction models all there but we have to find out how does this curious thing this is the "
