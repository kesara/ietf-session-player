One was There's this thing called the handshake encoding of the three bits. Three Pc n flags in the tcp had And it wasn't clear that you also have to use that. Were acknowledging a re. Because there is some some quite complex wording around when you transition into it establish date what you do. So that was made clear. And the detection of loss of the pure rack wasn't clear. For instance if if a Tcp option on there is causing all P x to be lost by some man middle box. That's all well and good, but you can't really tell when P x getting lost. Other than by detecting that you keep getting re transmissions because the other end isn't getting your at. So that was necessary to write in. Low.

There there was a fourth which I'll say verbally. ...And he wanted us to describe how on would allocate the remaining bit combinations of the three bit three header of flags that actually Used and I pushed back on that on the basis that there isn't really I the working group doesn't want the capability negotiation of Tcp to use the head of flag.

Even if we wanted to do that, could I don't think we could describe to Our how to allocate anything like this, because this was all a bit.

That was a useful going not you made about an area in the draft that talks about forward compatibility of those same bits. The same flags. Wearing in the draft it said only treat all other combinations of these three added flags. As or treat to other the combinations the three head of flags. As accurate Ec.

You you need to also specify how to what is the time to echo? Is quite these are quite but they are not specified. That's maybe more a question for puppy or next in the queue.

At least every third, ceo mark on on packets without any data without any nude newly delivered data. Cannot apply unless you're also using putting capability on those acts that on those Pure acts. You wouldn't be acknowledging them unless they had easy and capability. And that's why it only applies if you got Ac plus plus, which adds that you capability.

Because of the scene of the act being lost, an E plus plus the main motivation is to be able to put Ec capability on all Tcp control packets including the sin.

However, it may continue to sub optimal performance in some scenarios. For example, in so called large congestion with the scenarios, meaning a congestion window size much greater than the S we're saving up to one of every two acts maybe insufficient. For example, when performance limitations maybe place due to symmetric path capacity or when we may want to further reduce the additional coast and network load of too many x. Then are also small congestion window scenarios, meaning a congestion window size up to the order of one such as in data centers with a bandwidth product, maybe up to the order of one where delayed tax will incur delay much greater than the Rt.

And then there's the special case of r equal to zero. Which is used to request an immediate act from the receiver while keeping the steady state value of r. Please. So on the status of the draft it became a working document in February. So version zero zero as working group document had exactly the same content as the last version of the corresponding individual draft. And today, I'm presenting version zero one. Which seems dress comments received earlier on the mailing list mostly on the topic of stretch ax and then also a few minor additions and corrections. Next, please. So let's go through the updates. We have first couple of updates already in section three. Which describes the behaviors for the sender and receiver. So here, in order to ensure correct operation when is used. We have added couple of things for the sender, we've other the Dc sender. Does not communicate the value of r responding to an amount of database to be acknowledged at once by the receiver, greater than the receive window size or greater than the congestion window size. For the receiver correspondingly with added debt our option tcp receiver must ignore a value of our to an amount of bytes to the acknowledged once greater than the last received window size that it has announced."

So he will start by explaining that Army produce so called stretch packs which have been defined as axe that acknowledged more than two previously and acknowledged data segments. This tail issues such as Send burst, slow congestion window opening and lower frequency of Rt samples. So in section five, we have three subs sections which focus on these respective issues. Piece? So on the first one, send the burst. Explained that it may contribute to relative a overflow on packet loss. So we have added some possible mitigation for the sender? To use pacing, which requires an algorithm to determine did the segment transmission rate, which in this case would need to be commensurate with r. Next, please. Then the second subs section focuses on slow congestion with the opening. Problem is that during will start the congestion window increases by up to S upon receipt of a act covering new data. So then stretch acts or even delayed acts reduce the amount of x received by the sender. So this in turn will reduce the rate of congestion the growth. Will increase transfer time and or reduce throughput So One possible solution might be appropriate by counting that I've c three four six five, it might help solve the problem.

And also, even if there are few receiver implementations that would transmit one pack. Upon receipt of each new data segment. We have added that dc sender may use star with r equal to one. Four data segments transmitted during slow start. Next please? Finally, in section five zero three, it focuses us on low frequency of Rt samples, which is due to the fact that we would have stretched acts in some cases, then this reduces the responsiveness of the Rt d estimates to rt changes, and this might lead to having time based packet loss detection becoming inaccurate. So in some cases, there would be there could be a unnecessary delays Perhaps in other cases, it would be other way wrong with perhaps sp transmissions. So here as the first approach for mitigation of this problem. We've other debt sender should trigger ana arc being sent by the receiver at least once per, and there would be at least two options to do that. One is sending a data segment with option with r equal to zero at list once per rt, the other one would be using r greater than zero or perhaps as Jonathan Martin wrote on the list.

Mainly the point here is that in the draft, we stated the support of the option can be announced in segments that do not have the the same set. So in order to avoid implying otherwise, which was happened before. Now we have modified the sentence accordingly. So next please. Well, that's everything from my side.

The so the sender is actually the entity in control of both what it is sending, meaning it knows if it is expected to send out a larger number of packets, the number that is to be acknowledged or not? So therefore, it is also under the purview of the sender to set the the tire option... Accordingly. If, for example, it is it is it has only a very small congestion window. So I maybe would suggest to to have a more generic description that it is the that it is the responsibility of the to choose a tire option temporary with r equals zero or even longer term, say for... Let's say, for example during a slow start. That that make sure that the sender receives the expected acknowledgment rates that it is needed for all its mechanisms to work properly rather than, you know,"

At one point can you clarify what you want to see in this in the future panel? Ideally, I would like to see the usual like, interest from implement people who are deploying things on the network that's saying, yes, we're gonna do this.

So I recommend you in order to solve your problem which is a good problem to solve to find a completely different solution and not thinking about Tcp options. Sorry. Just to be very clear here. Security to more research later her on to find the... If there any any solution for Car because okay.

We don't use additional segment. And then we believe we don't change any tcp semantics. Please go to the next slide. So that concept of aggregate option is like this. So we know some option in segment just useful for integration with the feature. Such example is sa option or fast cookie or edi or car? In these options, basically in segment, in segment, there is these options, but it's used for on the of the feature in case on the feature means, I want to use this feature. That's about it. So this is basically one bit information. Then... But we have to use to or white what could be more options space to carry this one bit information especially in case of experiment drugs we have to consume space at least bytes. What could be more. And then the basic concept of aggregated option is to aggregate this option into a single option so that we can save a my space. Next slide, please. Then aggregated option carries aggregated brock.

In this format. Next slide please. And then by using opt and we weekend carry from one to four aggregated block. Next slide? And this is very simple usage for aggregated option. In this example, cry send the normal options such as timestamp while window scale? And at the same time, it's sending option in this case, option bits option a and of b's set. And then in this case, such as Timestamp window And then also, it has gonna get the option. And then bit for option beads set. In this example, option b will be used in disconnection because it's.

Another you know approach it's sending original option format and a option simultaneously if as long as we have space.

So my question was help you run any look at the the benefits of just implementing like, bit fields individual bits for individual options versus also including things like Ms and window scale the aggregated option. Because if this my my idea... So if this happens and gets deployed, Eventually, hopefully, most of the end hosts will support this. You would probably get more benefit by also rolling in some of the more common options like And windows scale into this aggregated option. As a as a multi field or as a dedicated group Id or something like this. So I would like to see some some analysis about the benefits to be had there. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Martin Duke, Yeah.
