Araz I guess yeah and she need to build name constraint intermediate city and it may have a lot of operation cost and for the main level stuff I eat my situation like it might be not that useful but if for example if we like monitor want to find out miss assurance but only want to see like company or service provider that I device window is a bit brighter for the record stuff something like that it might be used you rising okay anyway if those three methods I know are not free those two mistltein like enough for my station I want draft like that damn deduction Drock buckwheat\u0027s some consideration with security and scalability I it have any better missile like I really appreciate that yeah well if you\u0027re gonna use redaction here you\u0027re getting a lot of entropy in the in the redacted part of the name right yeah yeah so I mean typically the reason people want these names is because they actually want to type them in which means you want serial number dot you know dot domain name and that\u0027s not really gonna work like serial number plus 160 bits of like random crap but you\u0027re gonna need I mean well at least like right because other world is dictionary search throughout the information how do they redacted labels he was he was to hide the HS of the label right then you can you can hide it without you can completely hide it like literally redact not hash okay okay well thank you the previous the previous version just had a question mark this label is redacted this is dkg I wanted to ask why you\u0027ve "
