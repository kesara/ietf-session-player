I work for Comcast, NBCUniversal. I'm one of the co chairs My coach here is I entailed. He's so cool. It only has one name. And, of course, we have the best area directory in the entire IETF. Eric. So today, we have a sort of flipped agenda Originally, we were going to have Tommy, come and talk to us, about the draft they have active right now, and it's been on discussed on the list. But because we have a conflict with, several people that are at the other, I guess, the scone CD or whatever it is, session, we flip those and we'll do, as I said on the email earlier this morning, that's gonna be the 2nd is gonna be this afternoon So this morning, we're gonna go through the regular agenda, and then we're gonna dive right into the a discussion about architecture and directions this group wants to take. With in terms of architecture. So with that said, you said we've been subscribed, sir? Yes. sir. Limon is going to be our scribe. Thank you very much, So Here's the agenda. Any bashing people wanna do? Anything take it off, add it on, 1, 2 A dead agenda bash complete. So Welcome for the chairs. Oh, is there a home? Oh, Stewart. Just let's mention it here.

We're gonna move it on to the area director to, take the next steps. But now I've got nothing. I spoiled it. Dude. That was a big announcement. You stole it. Anyhow, and and and That's the main thing. The main comments we wanted to make and the reason we're gonna talk about the architectural today. Is we did have, a couple drafts that were up for a working group adoption. They received a lot of support for adoption, but they also receive a lot of comments back that they did not like the, security malts and security impacts in the way they were doing things. So we've decided to take step back and not focus on the drafts in question or, you know, yes or no? Is that how we wanna go? Instead, we're gonna talk about sort of where we wanna go architecturally in terms of security frameworks. And for those who have been with ADD for a while, We had a very similar conversation back in the early stages of ADD when we discussed should we allow DHCP RA environments? To be mechanisms for assigning and allocating, or communicating your resolver, options. For mock for, or dough. And after a log debate, including some people said, well, we absolutely needed an authenticated GGP option created and architect for the IETF a lot of other people stood up and said, well, we've tried that several times and it's failed each time because it's a very hard and intractable problem. We eventually came to an agreement on how to do it, and we successfully put out, and published back in November the specification for how to do discovery of adaptive DNS resolvers through, GHTRA environments. And so it it was a good example that, you know, with discussion of the problem,"

That we can find maybe a common path forward in this world too and that these drafts that came up and and one of them took it out. So there's really one left with that in it. That we can find a path for that we can do these kinds of things. Other option, by the way, is we may decide as a working group that there isn't a path forward and that this isn't work area that we can do or want to do. That's a perfectly valid outcome that the working group can decide. The role of the chairs we've talked about a lot is that we are here to guide the process for you, the working group, to talk through the issues, to make the decisions on what you want to do what directions you wanna go. Is not a top down organization. This is the bottom up organization. So today, we're gonna talk about The y, What's the motivation for doing these things? Tiru has very generously agreed to, write up a presentation that we're gonna show, and I'm just trying to understand for the group the motivations behind why this question's even being discussed, and they're rooted very much to the fact that we have a large amount of deployed infrastructure around the world where users daily are working in a space where they today cannot make easy use of adaptive DNS discovery, and they can't necessarily make use in some cases of dough and other encrypted solutions. And so there's a real sort of operational need. If we go back to the the core of the IETF, you know, running code is important as a way to decide how we do things. You can see all of these operational deployments as a sort of example of running code that we have to talk about at address."

I'm Thiru. I will talk about the need for hosting encrypted DNS servers on, CPEs. It could be CPs of managed CPs. It could be used in a home networks, enterprise networks, or any other deployment. I mean, just setting the context that we already have DNR and DDS vacations out. They pretty much make it easy for, endpoints to discover and use, encrypted resolve was provided by mobile networks and ISPs. That solves one leg of the problem. Right, instead of going to a pre configured resolver. The other challenge is there is Home network users have been using CPs all the long. What was the reason for using that if you see been used for several purposes, especially with the evolution of managed CPs"

There's several reasons why, ACPs are managed. One main reason that I would say and I have been working on is to improve security of the home network one primary purpose was to filter all the malicious domains we had techniques for anomaly detection one of the primary advantages that I could see with the solution that we had was protecting IoT devices, manufacturing user description is just one specification, which defines, for IOT devices, they have a specific intent. So they would visit big, domains unlike a traditional general purpose endpoint So we could define profiles where the manufacturer would give us the domain that an IoT device would visit. So it would reduce the attack vectors that would be possible to an device, and even if an average device visits, any domains beyond which it is intended to visit. We would detect and block and, notify the home strater, beyond that, there are several other advantages like, improves performance that all the DNIS resolution are it would cause aggregation by the home router itself. Cashing would be done and and it also helps provide local services. When we started deploying, network security services on home routers, there's a lot of work that happened in several other organizations to secure these home routers, because you can't run network security services. You're running on a platform which is insecure. Right? So these home routers, if you see, have been upgraded in the last 5 years, I would say, to have the best security practices similar to any vice router. Now coming back to the challenges that we are facing, after deploying these networks, security services was, hey, we have we could host, DNS, encrypted DNS servers on the home router, but then"

    "text": "would we provision these CPEs with certifications provided by a CA and how would we, work with the CS to get the CSN certificates And, managed CPs do is the burden, but the scale is a problem. For instance, in my previous organizations, we were shipping around 6 to 7000000 home routers, and we had to manage so many certificates. I'm pretty sure there are several other competitors who are also shipping on millions of, routers, and they would also have to manage such a large scale of certificates. Yeah. Quickly talking about what's happening in in the modern managed CPE, we already have several, flavors of, open DNIS Resolveers or DNIS forwarders that are optimized to run on home routers. They could run-in container for instance, talker for isolation purposes, network security devices are already running on secure home routers. And it's offered by several security vendors, my coffees. I'm trying microserver. This one, I I don't list all of them, but can imagine there are, like, at least 10 to 15 of them who already offer this kind of services. And and millions of secure CPs are already deployed today. Now what happened as part of the transition for the CPs to host network security services is we started working on the requirements and then the functionality that would be available on these managed CPEs I'm just listing few of them. I'll give references to where all this work happened. All this work has happened as part of PRPL Foundation, which is which is an open collaborative body for developing, secure, platforms for home routers and limited devices. Some of these features, you might have seen all of this in traditional, enterprise routers that it would have a Patch Management and update policy without user intervention, secure transport,"

Vulnerability Management, exploit mitigation, runtime integrity to check if the, platform is compromised or and then microservices and, containers for sandboxing various network services lots of work haps has happened in PRPAIL Foundation in the last to 7 years. And we were part of that foundation to basically harden, open the BLT and and now that's being shipped and and then it's in production. There were some questions during the working group that, hey. You already have w p PA 3, it's, it's using quantum resistant crypto. Why are you why do you worry about? Why can't you stick with DNS over, clear text. Right? Yes. WP3 does offer security. But the challenge is there could still be multiple network devices between the endpoint and the network entity, which is hosting, the DNIS Forwarder and you would want to make sure only the endpoint and the, Tina's forwarder can look into the request and responses. For instance, in case of a mesh deployment, you would have multiple mesh routers, and you would typically encrypted is forward. It could be deployed at a mesh gateway, and you'd want only want to see the mesh gateway. See other challenge is clients may not know what's underlying Wi Fi you're using And and the other challenge is, the industry level may or may not located with the WPS server Right? So with that in mind, right? I mean, when I started, building that product long time back, we were looking into both the mechanisms on which which discovery mechanism would work for, these, CPEs, GDR, scope is restricted to public IP addresses, as we all know, I had one challenge that we see is that, CS are not supporting IP address based validation if you had to go"

And the other challenge was, whenever ipv6 prefix changes your certificate has to change again. So there's no way that we could do any deployment with GDR as such. GNR was was was our plan that we could do something with DNR, 11 possible solution that we had opted was hey. Let's provision each CPE with a unique subdomain. For instance, cpeone.ispone.comorcpone.net security vendorone.com or something like that. And and we would talk to the ISCS and get each of these home routers provisioned with a a certificate. Which is unique to each home network. That pretty much solved the problem, for us, but it went through a lot of, discussions with several CAs because, they were, reluctant to give us, millions of sub domains and millions of certificates. So For instance, when we tried, let's say encrypt, they realized we're bombarding them with more than 1,000,000 of requests and they just started and when we had a call, they were they felt like they were subjected to a DDoS attack. Right. So, it's it's it's solved an interesting problem that that I think everybody would have a face today that we always assess our home router with hudpss, right, your local IP address that your, router manufacturer would give. But this changed the game that we would give, the home router HTTPS access because We have a sub domain assigned to it. And now, we could log in to the domain portal using, router portal using DPS. So that was probably a major win that came as part of the as a byproduct of basically hosting, certificates on the home router and then provisioning and unique subdomain."

And then the whole cycle of refreshing this because usually certificates have a typical lifetime of 60 days. And you would have to keep repushing them. By default, see is thought this is a data set. Unless you had you have a business agreement with them and you, have an arrangement that, hey. This is not a DDoS, and we are a subscriber. They that that, they don't give you those many number of certs. There's a lot of work happening in other working groups with regard to scale problem even with CDNs, start certificates where you have a pops up mechanism to basically renew certificates for your downstream CDMs but the scale of downstream students seems to be much lower than with auto deployment, which would scale into millions. Up. There were in addition to what we have already done and the challenges that we face, probably still facing, right, managing these certs without We were looking for other potential ways of simplifying this dependency on the CA there are disadvantages and advantages all the approaches. For instance, we tried the TLS delegate credentials it has an advantage that it would completely remove the dependency on the CSCA, which Q1 cert and and and delegated credentials would be assigned by the by the entity managing these home routers back to each of the CPE, which is like you still have unique public private keypads on each of the home router, but they would be signed by the, entity who's managing these home routers. The only challenge with that mechanism was that none of the clients were supporting this. And the other challenge was that, even, we won't give an,"

The other one was name constraints, which is like a subca but none of the CS support that because of various regulatory and other reasons and, the CA browser forms, basically, does not inquiries that use being supported, and it it was frequent auditing. So none of the CS support that. So this is like this the current state of the art that I see that there are 3 to 4 solutions. We have deployed 1 solution, which required a lot of traction with the CAs. The other ones among the other ones, the subsets was probably, one that had presented a draft, but there was a lot of, questions back and forth with regard the deployability of this even on home routers and the need for doing this on home when we could do this just with the ISPs encrypted resolvers. So that's where I think, we got struck and I think I'm glad that the chairs have asked us to take a step back so the working group realizes There's a problem, and we have solved it in a particular way. It it it would help us to see, like, are we gonna solve this problem in a conventional way of these certs by ourselves, are we gonna do something else to make our life easier? Are you ready for some questions here? Yeah. Mike, Michael. We can we can start the queue. Michael Richardson, I just wanted to reiterate what you said about, name constraints. In 2019, 2018, 2019, I was involved in a project to do put put certificates in devices, and we had slightly different reasons than then then then DNS issues. And I actually spent at least 3 months reaching out and talking to CA's asking, and whatever happened to that enterprise certificate stuff, stuff, that we used to be able to get. Okay?"

And that wasn't crazy for the entity that we but I was in Okay? But what we discovered is this was a product that some of them were remembered selling. Couldn't remember why they stopped selling it. Okay. Does it seem like a good deal? But eventually I understood what you just said, and there's a forum, not forum, but just to make it clear, it's a C browser forum, CAP forum, and the issue is that the CAs have to implement certain policies on what they do. And when they issue that subordinate CA certificate, they have to make sure that you implement all those policies. And that's where all the money and the auditing and suddenly, $20,000 seems like a a loss to them when they do that, and then your impact of doing that. So effectively, the only way that they support subordinate CA's is if they run the CA for you. Because that's the only way they can beat make the auditing cheap, which is they run the software. Okay? At which point, I ask, so how much for each of my IoT devices will each certificate cost. Anyone wanna get order of magnitude guests $1000. 4.95 each. I think that was getting the quantity discount. Right. Because I was like, I'm sure that's the quantity 1 or the quantity 1000. I'm gonna be 1000 of these. Are you sure that's the number? You don't mean $4.95.

So that we don't have a dependency on 1 CA, but I couldn't find even a single CA who was willing to do this at a rate that would have preapplicable for us. Thanks. Rafael Akamai, thanks a lot for for doing this. And, I mean, I definitely wanna have, the CPE kind of being able to terminate the secure connections. And I definitely see that there is a kind of financial problem there, I mean, There's the stuff out called TSA that we actually put in the DNS. But, it it it it it it potentially could increase the kind of circular dependency, but if you could sign it within a sec, mean, having something that doesn't rely on this is probably a better way forward Yeah. I mean, if Dane could be supported by browsers, right, I mean, that's great for us. I mean, even if they could conditionally support for this and not for the other purposes. Also, it's totally great.

At the time we did this, we are we are we are paying Okay. So, you were able to do this, and you, like, you were able to deploy this and pay for the certificates. And the problem was just that it was too expensive in the end. Too expensive and too much dependency on the CA to manage all this when the SLAs were, like, especially when we were doing the refresh, right, the time to giving you search and all. The time was quite unpredictable. We we had constant with them and it was felt like, The time is quite unpredictable from few milliseconds to minutes together when when they have, we have to keep asking and refreshing those millions of search.

I mean, it would have, I was always assuming that if it if it makes itself more of an active attacker, then it would be pretty easy for us to detect that then if it was a passive attacker. Okay. But if it's a passive attacker, then Then DDR opportunistic DDR already covers you. Because opportunistic DVR lets you do the encrypted protocol upgrade without any of certificate headaches. Right.

It was I was referring to a case where Hey. You have multiple devices and you want to have end to end encryption rather than just relying on WP Sure. So, this is my my point here is that There's, Opportunistic encryption is a lot easier to accomplish than authenticated encryption here And if we want to get to authenticated encryption, I think we need to be We need to convince ourselves that we are actually accomplishing that and not just putting a lot of sugar coating on top of opportunistic encryption.

And Dennis Folders. So I think we do need to solve this problem. Thank you. That's, you, Mister Houston? Are you local or remote?"

    "text": "Oh, there he is. Yep. Jeff Houston, I think on the previous slide, you mentioned our the 8739 as being the foundation here. Yes. Somewhere there's star certificates. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I noticed You can't revoke a star certificate. I noticed If you lose your key, You just have to tolerate the badness. Of whatever scale the badness might be, until the damn thing expires. You know, let's encrypt it's 90 days. God knows what these lifetimes are. Are you seriously proposing a framework around CA certificates where As soon as you stuff it up, there's no going back. You just have to don your asbestos undies and just live with this stuck burning in front of you until the thing expires. That's the theory, right? Right. So Right. wanting to Right. That's all I've been Makes sense. Right? So what trying to say was that, right, I was up with a fully managed start, like, what we have done today. We could in case if we see that the managed CP has gone Rob could just immediately revoke the certificate. But rest of the all the mechanisms, including delegate credentials or star. As we like them, there is no way to At least in Star, I believe there is a way to revoke delegated credentials have a lifetime of 7 days. We can't revoke that. Right? So so badness needs to be a slow burn Right. Takes more than a week. Yes. those kinds of badnesses. I just wish they existed in the real So reason I that's the world. Yeah. It it it is a problem. Once you walk into this space, that revocation is this soft underbelly of the entire sort of PKI sort of place. And doing instant revocation. Has its own overhead, which in Star, they simply said, no. We're just not gonna touch that It is what it is. And if your key is compromised, badness is gonna happen, and you can't stop it. It seems a bit weak,"

    "text": "for this kind of work is is where I was leading to. Yeah. I'm not advocating are for it as such. I was just saying that these are all the mechanisms that are there in IT so far. But if you don't advocate star and you're doing certificates, how do you handle revocation? We are not doing start. Currently, we are using a doing certificates. How you handle problem? do this We have we are using, revocation, the typical revocation mechanism. We do one that gets updated once a week. We have 60 days Right. 60. Yeah. 60 days. And and we have the full ability that the operator of the device can revoke the cert at any point of time. Are not using start certificates. But it's it's checking the revocation. That's the issue. Not the fact that the CA revokes it. You can revoke at any time. the time. All the clients check for your patient. All do All the time. Yeah. Every time they establish a new connection. If if I can step in here. So so, Jeff, you're you're asking a good question. I think they're about a very specific deployed solution that he's taking lessons from. We're trying to talk about the higher level Abstract, is this an approach that he wants to take or not? Where I was heading was that in all of our deployments, of of PKI Certificate Systems. Revocation is a real issue. Because if you're constantly doing here's a certificate I need to check its status. That that's a huge amount of traffic that goes to wherever that status response comes from. And the shortcut done in most of the certificate world is that produce these huge revocation lists. Once a week. And so the question you're asking is, Was this Dodd a week ago? Whereas the question you thought you were asking is is this dud right here right now? And it's those kinds of problems that the certificate folk just shovel under the carpet. Yes. So so I I'm a take away it's a good call you've made, and I and so I I'm hearing is is there's an additional"

I mean, I think just wanted to say Android is one of the implementations that doesn't currently do DDR, but we are working on it. And I think we are going to I think we're gonna support by this name based and opportunistic. Of course, you know, if if we don't have the right IP addresses on the CPs, then I don't think that'll work. That said, I mean, a lot of CPs do have public IP space. And it it doesn't seem impossible to assign them property in his names. You're the operator. Right? With for for before. Yeah. There's no way, but for an ipv6. A lot of CPs do have ipv6. Particularly new ones. So That could be a way of saying, because, like, one of the, one of the issues in the slide is, like, well, if we don't have a public addressed and it doesn't work. I was like, well, yeah. That's ipv4. Don't use ipv4. Don't use IP before only. I mean, they don't use ipv4 only is is kind of industry best practice at this point. Right? So, you know, many network do this. Yes. If you have a public IP address TDR in stick would work, but not the authenticated one. Welcome back then. Realistically, am I gonna trust some random CPE It's buggy. It's not up to date. It's probably owned. I mean, in terms of No. Bizarre. The the the, I mean, just like any endpoint, right, I mean, there are content providers who are good in batches like CPs, which are good in batch. Right? I mean, this you can't just because there's some, brick, CPEs, you can't say, all the managed CPs are bad. Right? We have been deploying this we have been have been constantly updating the firmware and software to keep up with the latest crypto and and and and software updates. So"

Go ahead, Ben. Hey. So I'm I'm here to nitpick Lorenzo. So, DDR has Like, a lot of modes, at least 3 in my view. There is name based DDR. Where you say, Like, hey, operating system. My DNS server is dns.google. And the operating system to learn about what the hat what what is up with DNS dot Google resolves, a a DNS record for underscore DNS.dns.google. there And that tells it information about that thing. And then there are There are the IP address modes, modes, and in those modes, there's a further subdivision between authenticated and opportunistic modes. And for any IP address, you always are within your rights to do opportunistic. In which case, it doesn't matter if you're talking to a completely broken and secure DNS server that is being operated by the adversary opportunistically encrypt to it. You haven't made anything worse. You haven't you, but you, you haven't made it much better. And there's the authenticated encryption Modes which only apply are if the server has a public IP address. And if the server was was configured to you by a public IP address, So however your configuration worked, it, it that's what you got. Then DDR becomes a little more powerful. You have some redirection capabilities But we're talking here about the opportunistic mode. So whether or not the IP address is in the, in the public space, know, you can safely just start encrypting to it if it says that that's allowed. Yes."

So, Again, for the, For the DDR opportunistic, it really doesn't matter what what Ben said. It was a cute Okay. Well, that's the queue. So does everyone now feel comfortable we have framed the problem? The answer is yes, we have no more questions to ask. If you have questions now, it's the time to ask. We've got about 14 minutes left in this morning session. I'm gonna point out the crisp boxes left over to me a couple times like, So I think Chris is wondering, what have I agreed to? Or he's trying to make dinner reservations and, wondering what he agreed to. Sorry for sorry for Chris for calling you up. So if we are done with this thing, I'm gonna say maybe we call the session early, if we frame the problem, We will meet again this afternoon at 3 30. And what room are we into? Slide someone. To It's in this up, and then just join the keys up, but we'll get one one second. I'll give you a chance to talk. So the the the remain the next session will pick up at 3:30 this afternoon in Room Pichu where we will start off with, Tommy Jensen is going to talk to his draft. We're gonna take comments, and then we're gonna go back to this thing, but probably go more in the, well, what do you wanna do about it mode? But with the expectation, We are not expecting that we're all gonna walk out of here at the end of today going, well, that problem solved. Is the hard problem. We're talking about how to solve it and approaches to So don't think we're gonna solve it this afternoon, but we are gonna have some great conversations. And now, Ben,"

I, no, I just wanna say something that, I think we sort of were circling around in the chat, which is In my view, this question of connecting to your DNS server, on your local network, Securly or more securely, whatever that means, is exactly the problem as connecting to your printer. More securely, it's exactly the same problem. As connecting to your local file server or your TV or whatever. And Those are interesting problems. Those are problems that I think the IITF should try to solve. But I don't think that there are problems that ADD should try to solve on its own. I think what we can do is take our deep, deep, deep, deep, investigation and experience with this particular version of the problem and take that up to some broader, maybe new working group at the IETF, and and make sure that we we come up with a broader solution that addresses this use case among all the others. Yeah, Mister Megan? Oh, Eric, ring one one, Mister Vink. Yeah. Both as Eric Vinc both as an eval contributor as an AD, I start to see that this problem is much bigger than ADD So food for talk for this afternoon. I just heard that we're done here and that the ISG is gonna solve all the problems for the rest of us. They'll they'll they'll No. No. Trust we do. I I was trying to do an optimistic problem in up optimistate upgrade Alright. So we'll see you all gain at the Houston at 3:30 this afternoon in Room P 2. See you then. Have a good lunch."
