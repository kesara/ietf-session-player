It has been just adopted on, released, in terms of a ISS, ISISG review, We have the past segment in MPS based segment routing network. Which has passed the IETF last call. This is on the agenda I used to schedule the 40 at the end of this month. In term of HR application segment, the ISG has approved the document in, in August. It's now in RSCD docu.

So on that one, there was also in the poll strong support to close it. But there were also some outstanding technical comments at the time. So now all of these comments have been replied to some, and there was no further discussion on on the topic on the list So perhaps we could close it as well.

This is about circuit style segment routing, and I would like to give you a quick update. The draft got adopted lately, and essentially the focus was on making sure that comments that were raised during the adoption call. Got address I have a few highlights, point out here. From a content perspective, we added the creation of the policies using BGP so that's a fairly bigger, change that happens. We also now mentioned in the introduction a bit more clearly what the use case is. Is basically a bunch of pseudo wires that, you would run over stockpiled policies in the a typical scenario, And then we had some discussion on the bandwidth and its commitment. Went ahead and, you know, change the wording a bit to not necessarily use the word commitment and, clarify know, what is being done and essentially not doing anything different to what we have done. For many years in, RSCP networks so far. And then, of course, a couple of, you know, you know, changes here and there as always. Next slide. Oh, okay. Sorry. Oh, okay.

Essentially, we are leveraging already existing you know, definitions in, in other documents, essentially a centralized controller would perform path computation, as well as the pain we've bookkeeping for the intended circuit style policy. Instantiated at the headlands using BGP. Because now everything is driven from the controller. The headings don't need to signal to decide a diversity and co routing and bidirectional constraints. So essentially, you know, those signaling extensions in case of B2B are not needed. The creation is using the SR policy, NLR, NLRI, defined in the, IDR segment routing T policy document, and based on the protection and restoration scheme, you would either send you know, multiple analyze or a single and then I'll arrive. Reporting would be done with BGPLS. And we're gonna use the CA and B flags to indicate whether a path is active and care and traffic. The C flag you know, is indicating that the path came from a controller, and the beef leg would be if the candidate bath is a backup path. So all in all, I think, quite straightforward. Ends the respective changes were done throughout the, the the document. Now, next slide. A bit of a shameless plug for private line emulation, but maybe related to what, sir, I mentioned that we made now a statement in the introduction that one prime use case is pseudo wires over circuit sale policy based on a comment, I wanted to highlight to this group here that actually in pals, there is some work going on for bitstream pseudo wires, which, I think, are a good candidate and, you know, a typical deployment we will see that will leverage the, Circular policy, in the network to sustain the bandwidth as well as give the"

But before to that answer. What was disc what was considered during that RFC writing is in MPLS. We have this experience an issue. That when we define a new fact, n, Network is deployed. It's very difficult to introduce new O and M mechanics. So over time, Like, we learn from time when we start defining this control plane and data plane validation in MPLS. To now. What experience have shown is that is very operationally, very complex to upgrade every time you do a new new type of state or new fact, it's it's very, very complex for that. So, actually, It is It is interesting that there is a work going on and I'm Gilles for the group. For that basically generalizes. That We need to do or NN job is to do controlled plain check. And it generalizes the fact so that you can just do care of them. Sorry. When a job is to do data painter, and it generalizes NPS when able to do data painter. And overall, people are happy that simplification because it simplify the network deployment. So I think my comment is that we need to really think about if you want to go this route.

So before diving into the behaviors of SRV 6 in this draft, I'll give a a brief overview the the motivation for the draft is convergence in EVPN. So convergence in, EVPN, especially EVPEN L203, is, control plane driven right now. So there are several straightforward solutions that exist, right, using peer service labels and using information that is currently available. But these solutions, these, these easily accessible solutions have drawbacks two examples are, for example, that they may they may lead to loops in the network. Microloops in the network, and they also do not work for all the EVPN load balancing modes. So as it stands, EVP and convergence is very hard to get to the reasonable set of sub second or, or even at times, extremely aggressive convergence targets So the support for SRV 6 underlay was recently added to this drive, I believe, last, last spring,"

The draft came from, from MPLS Underley, but we're talking here service it and reroute it. So if you think about, you know, any VPN, a multi homing, environment, represented here by P1andp2. All active, single active, whichever load balancing mode. If the failure happens, for example, this is the easiest one to to describe Right? If the failure happens on, the access side. On the CE side, effectively both links at P1 and P2 will be seen as going down fairly simultaneously. And, what's gonna happen with the the straightforward solution is both these are going to encap and encap reroutes to each other, and this is going to, a micro So the first behavior of, of this, of this reroute is the behavior of what we call this position. Rights, rights, So once a reroute occurs, that reroute Sid disposals terminally. Right? There is no further reroute possible using that so that the once rerouted packets do not go through another rerout. Next slide, please. So the second behavior, which is specific to EVPNandevpnloadbalancing any VPN when you have p 1 and p 2, EV pen will do what is, what's called a DF election, right, to select a designated forwarder between P1 and P2."

P2's reaction is, like I said, before, control plane driven So p 2 will only learn about this, failure at p 1 at control plane speed. Whatever that may be, but 100 of milliseconds at best. If I do a redirection at pone, at, effectively interface down local, local detection speed I'm gonna be rerouting traffic right into a blocked or down interface at p to So there's no real gain there of my redirect. So the other behavior that we're defining is effectively this this, bypass tunnel or this, bypass Sid does what we we termed as the election bypass. So when that packet arrives at p 2, p 2, the p 2 behavior for that, Sid, is to bypass the DF election specifically because it knows it is a rerouted package. So the the main, benefit of this is for single active load balancing. Because single active does bidirectional blocking of of traffic. But it applies equally to all active, single active, board active and so on. On the next So the SIV 6 support that we added very much mirrors what we did for MPLS, right, so a a first SID is, is gonna be signaled. That is the service SID whether that be n.ttouornd.dx2, for example, And alongside with this, a, a second sID, which constitutes of effectively the service it with, with an attribute in this case, the reroute attribute argument, sorry, the reroute argument"

So, basically, if there is a ripped of people in entry. For a seat. And then That entry for that seat is removed after at SPF. So if these conditions satisfy then. Can determine that That seat is the failed seat. For example here, No Dan failed. So the 1st, Aptra and the point, p 1, on the past, through node N. So after the failure, after convergence, on the on the failure. P 1, will determine that sedan is the failed seat. So in this case, p 1, will provide protection or failure of of no earn or See that. Basically, p 1, we'll, flops, This again, And then Shasta to send a packet using the top seat of of a packet along the sort is passed. So that's the extension.

You're parallel. So that's a that's a reply. Good. So So this, proposal is, is different ways, and then we'll be So we need to discuss our various days. Okay. Maybe the first question is why do we need a second solution? Yeah. I think this this one is simple. Is similar than the purchase. I'm for example, the purchase 1 is some kind of timer So the hold of the hold of some for the entry and and That's the I sent it in the drop time of 1. We've described that one. Find similar than that, just Okay. The engine oil, we are not looking for multiple solutions for problems. So you you would need a a clear, benefit. Okay. Discuss in this one. Yes. Either in the more in the drop in more details. Yes. In the draft, maybe you can introduce your draft.
