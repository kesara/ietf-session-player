    "text": "have I have a short comment on this too first though and that\u0027s that I think that this whole notion of handing the client where to go next is not only is it a really powerful one it closes a lot of the security holes that we\u0027ve seen in the wild over the last few years with having a single discovery document that can mix and match different services especially when you\u0027re relying on you know replayed shared secrets client credentials and things like that throughout your network so I do think that that this is good and you know retrospectively I wish we would have done ooofff to you like this to start with so you know I\u0027d like to the chairs to consider maybe OAuth 3 at this point we\u0027ve got enough stuff bolted on to OAuth 2 that it\u0027s not really Oh off to you anymore that\u0027s for the chairs to consider though over more alcohol to the to the previous point and this is also about bolting more things into OAuth I agree with the the point that was raised before about how we have to consider this resource indicator along with scope I think we also have to think how it fits along with audience because we\u0027re having multiple dimensions of ways to describe what am I trying to do right because ultimately the idea with scope was we have one simple bucket to put everything of that means what is this token good for and it turned out in the real world that a lot of people want more expressive \u0027ti than what that allows in a reasonable fashion and it\u0027s the the real trouble comes not with just the listing because you can obviously just put you know resource URLs as scopes and that works today you don\u0027t need an extension for that the problem with that comes with the combination of all of these different things and managing those combinations so explicitly creating multiple categories reasonable idea but it the combination of those has to be very carefully prescribed in in my view otherwise we\u0027re going to end up with people who are interpreting a particular combination of scope audience resource of one way and people interpreting the same combination in a different Indian compatible way so the client that thinks it\u0027s asking for one thing is actually asking for something else just because it\u0027s talking to a different a s and that\u0027s not a world we want to live in William Dennis I think this is a very valuable thing to have and I like the idea that it\u0027s more generic than Dick\u0027s draft I think we should have a generic expression for this I think I was also supported in 2016 when he presented it so yeah let\u0027s let\u0027s merge it that would be my suggestion so Annabel Backman Amazon a couple of points pretending to be dick here I think the driving factor for Dick\u0027s "

    "text": "draft focusing on client credentials is just that\u0027s the use case so I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any objection around expanding that to broader and more broadly than that likewise is this one draft is it two drafts one focusing on the audience one focusing on resource I think that\u0027s immaterial as far as as that\u0027s concerned it just let\u0027s just get it done the other comment I wanted to make is when we talk about resource into indicators I think there\u0027s two very similar but importantly different use cases there one is the wanting to be more specific about what is being asked for in this access token am I am I asking for scope XYZ for resource server a or scope XYZ for resource server B that\u0027s that\u0027s one thing as those are potentially the same scope but with different meanings the other side is the security aspect of making sure that the access token that the authorization server is issuing an access token that\u0027s then going to be used with with the right server and not with the and now with a man-in-the-middle type of attack those are two very important use cases they are also slightly different from one another so we need to make sure that whatever solution we land on here that we\u0027re supporting both of those okay I\u0027m gonna cut the mic after John John Bradley so you know they the to sort of address different sides of the issue I was initially opposed and putting them together but thinking about it the security considerations around resource and audience restricting the tokens are so important to not shooting ourselves in the foot with client metadata it\u0027s probably at least useful to start off with them as a single document we may decide to split them up later but working on them together will probably would probably help us think through some of the security issues that we\u0027re creating for ourselves I\u0027m the one of the very original one of the very early threats identified for oauth2 was well what if you let it clot what if you let a resource to say where its authorization server is well that immediately leads to bad resources you know tricking a client to go to a bad resource and get a token that is going to be handed over very token that gets handed over to it that it can then use it someplace else so we have to think about all of these security issues very closely and one the the resource indicator or whatever we do for that is "
