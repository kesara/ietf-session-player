Baum I started to be like kind of direct straightforward dmn solution from pimmit but of course we agree it\u0027s the document I mean if the working group part of the document and they weren\u0027t going to believe that we should improve our other functionalities and going a different I mean evolved direction yeah of course we would agree to do so yeah to consider other other things and to to extend the solution with that but the I mean the kind of the trigger for the document was like okay there is this diamond race be me is trying to do a pimmy base solution right that is the mm well I guess part of my motivation for asking the question is that we\u0027re you know focusing a lot of attention on 5g and 5g is nothing except you know if it\u0027s not high-performance and so adopting a new approach for local mobility I think should take a lot of effort to make sure it\u0027s high performance and fulfill some of that need q so in the last 20 or 500 we pull the working group and there was consensus but at that time I was not ready because I mean I did not see much shot many discussions in the mailing list right but looks like lately there were some discussions I saw a bunch of people commenting on it right and so I think just a rough poll right you know anybody you know how many people you know support the adoption of this document is a working group document two three four okay fine fine okay okay all right how many people oppose this work to be adopted as a working or document okay "
