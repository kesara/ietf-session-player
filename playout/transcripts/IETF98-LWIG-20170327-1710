    "text": "the one of the critical point here the sample policy is based on reservation so you have a tablespace you make a reservation for routing direct child\u0027s as well as pyaari authentication sessions now if the parent elements can be occupy the parent elements can be filled up in all the places because it is possible to edit those entries if required so the point is that the table space will be properly utilized in case routing childs are not available or authentication sessions are not available one of the things that is mentioned on this slide is about the graceful rejection of Dow and panel messages so in case of implicit signaling it is important that there has to be some sort of rejection mechanism available in the signaling for example if you send a Dow the table is full there is a Dow with negative acknowledgement present but in case of but similarly in case of penna signaling such a negative mechanism is not available this negative signaling is not available so you can\u0027t really use pen I discovery for as a complicit mechanism for signaling the next piece some of the issues that we have faced is now this is the reactive policy you send a Dow you send the NS and then it gets speared but what happens if the same for example if a parent nodes neighbor cache is full and it sends a DI oh there is a good chance that some other child might come up and select that node as a parent so how would this child come to No Child load come to know that the parent does not have enough space available so the currently there is no way to know this because this is a currently it\u0027s a reactive policy so what we are recommending here is there might be some solution possible based on a proactive approach for example the NC the neighbor cache entry metric has to be advertised as part of di oh hello this is working the the NC metric has to be advertised as part of di o messaging now one more important thing here is that this proactive approach applies to not only the ripple protocol but as well to the Pinet discovery message incredible now the metric containers that are available with the ripple has to be shared between panel discovery messaging as well as ripple anyways currently based on the drab so there is one question that is asked here can ripple matrix containers be reused by another protocol and I don\u0027t see any reason why but I would like to take an opinion about from the working group if someone else thinks that it cannot be reused then you would like to know X like this yeah so basically there are some questions that we have asked here should we consider a signaling extension in for proactive mode not as part of this draft because this is this specifically the guidelines and policy draft and secondly "
