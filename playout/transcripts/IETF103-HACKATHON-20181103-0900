    "text": "a few of those too well welcome I hope it and I believe this is a really good introduction into the IETF and please take advantage of all the people around you you\u0027ll find they\u0027re pretty friendly and it\u0027s a great way to get started in a you know working in the IETF as reading drafts and all that\u0027s good but and just jumping in and and actually implementing something is really great too and we appreciate you being here and helping us create more running code around what we\u0027re doing at the IETF that\u0027s really the main point of these hackathons is to you know spend more time on implementations it\u0027s great writing the specs but if we\u0027re implementing them at the same time that helps us find problems in the spec you know and it results in better specifications and also very importantly runs in code results in code that other people can pick up and start using so again in addition to just reading the spec and figuring out how to implement something if you create a library utility an SDK something that\u0027s going to help someone start actually implementing and adding support for the protocol into their product that\u0027s even better so those are the types of things we like to do and hopefully we can accomplish all that with this hackathon everything we do here and at the IETF is under the note well if you\u0027re not familiar with the note well policy I don\u0027t expect you to read it real quickly here these slides are I\u0027ll show you where they are and you can go take a closer look also I like to tell just a little bit about IPR and code contributions the code that you\u0027re working on oftentimes it\u0027s governed by its own license some type of open-source license is pretty common some of you maybe you were working on proprietary code that\u0027s fine you can work on code in the context of the hackathon you\u0027re not like signing it over the ITF when you do that but at the end we will have some presentations and kind of like in a working group any any presentation or are things you share on the mailing list that those are all IETF contributions so hopefully that\u0027s clear if you have any questions about that or concerns cutting you can come see me afterwards we can talk about it the agenda so we\u0027re you know pretty much on time if you haven\u0027t noticed that the hackathon is pretty ad-hoc it\u0027s pretty much you know serve yourself but if you have a problem or concern getting situated you know come see me at any time and I\u0027ll try to help you out or direct you to someone who can after this bit of a kickoff then the idea is if you haven\u0027t already to find a team to work with and you can switch move between teams that\u0027s actually encouraged we love to see projects that go across different teams across different technologies that the IITs working on that\u0027s all fine and good so don\u0027t feel like you need to you know be stuck in just one place and lunch will "
