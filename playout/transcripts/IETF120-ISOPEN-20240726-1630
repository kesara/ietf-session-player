This session is is open, I guess, IS open, we haven't really decided on that yet Independent submission stream open meeting And we've got, I believe, two hours We have a scribe, which is fantastic Thank you, Susan Next slide, I guess This is the Note Well. For those of you, who have been here all week, you should now be well and truly familiar with this. These are the terms and conditions under which we participate in the IETF regarding things like privacy, your behavior and intellectual property. They're quite serious so if you're not familiar with them, we encourage you to use your favorite search engine to search for IETF note well and to read and understand those terms And if you have any questions, you can talk to us or any other ideas leadership leadership This may actually be particularly important in this gathering so"

And in particular, if you make a comment, at the mic, then nip along to the hedge dot and make sure that your comment was recorded as you said it the materials are online and that's all good So if you've got this far in the week and you haven't worked this out, then that's pretty amazing But in the room, keep your audio and video off completely. If you're remote make sure audio and video are off when it's not your turn to speak And honestly, using a headset, remotely really, really improves the experience for the other people who are listening That's me, yes We're not quite sure.

We're going to have an introduction to the stream and kind of an overview of its operation from Russ, kind of in the more general and Elliott about specifically what he's been doing And then we'll have just questions of clarification about the presentation. And I will model my behavior in that section on martin thomson excellent chairing this week in terms of only questions of clarification and then we'll have an open mic about gathering feedback about the stream and about the topics here And then if we have next steps, especially feedback to the other about the stream and about the topics here. And then if we have next steps, especially feedback to the IAB or next steps, we'll try and wrap Any questions? Any agenda passion? okay so I believe we're starting with Russ Russ Does this work?"

And so you couldn't see separate those roles In fact, if you look at these faces, that's exactly what you'll see. The John Postel started out as the RFC editor, and then for a while this is the old slide anyway Joyce Reynolds is missing here and there was a period of time where Joyce and John Postel shared the role and they went to great lengths so to make sure that no one could tell which one of them handled a particular doctor"

Here we go All right, so how's the process work? Basically, you say the submission in, in the same way that every other document starts as an independent internet draft. So there's an initial valuation where the ISE makes a judgment call as to whether it's going to go forward or, hey, if you dealt with these issues it could go forward, documents get updated to resolve those concerns and then it goes to the IESG for their conflict review again that's advice not a yes-no, but a"

Go ahead or the work is related to an IETF working group this particular one, but the relationship is such that there's no problem with it proceeding or the one that leads to the most discussion is this could potentially disrupt the work of the IETF. That would, lead to a big discussion about whether the document should go forward but it is not a big discussion about whether the document should go forward, but the, but it is not a, you know, the death of the document. It's a discuss that how we can make that not disrupt And sometimes that's time Make sure the IETF work is published first, then the could go forward or this particularly document violates the procedures for a particular IANA registration, for example Well, we've got to figure that out and that would require for example, if specification required, that might be okay. If it's not but if it requires standards action, it's not okay. It clearly would an ISC sponsored doc document could not get a code point that required standards So usually the result is consider the advice, ask the authors to make some changes, negotiate a note to put on the front of it with the IESG as a said, delay publication, but it's the ISE's decision here This gives you some indication of how many documents"

That is to say interoperability anything that facilitates interoperability or an aspect of interoperability which is knowing what's on the wire. So if you're sniffing the wire, or looking at an application you don't understand what you're seeing if an RFC can document that that can help the reliability of the internet. Levity so the ICE is responsible for the April Fool's RFCs However, as I've said elsewhere, I really think that we could all use levity whenever we can find it We tend to live in a lot of strife these days Anything that can help alleviate that it's actually going to rise to the top of my Q pretty quickly assuming that it's appropriate Some people on my editorial board will say, hey, you got to be really careful about that because of cultural differences It's something I try to take into account and a good example of something I thought was pretty good was the RFC that was written by ChatGBT most recently. Continuous improvement is the third priority. This is a pretty big bucket That means maybe help us learn right? What can we do better? Maybe what have we done, where have we made a misstep perhaps? What technology should we be looking at?

Warren had to work carefully with me on this to make sure that we could do this safely and paul hoffman provided a substantial amount of this assistance on that as well But the idea is that you get to control your own namespace and how you interpret it if you want to And then we also did RFC 9446 which was a review of what had happened since 2014 when 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed the issues that were going on with the NSA And that was a particularly interesting one because we had perspective from Steve Belevin, a former security director, and the current, more recent security director, stephen farrell and Farzan Abadi, who's a human rights expert, and one other person who I'm slipping on that point"

If I don't think the reader is going to get anything from the document, there's a very small likelihood you're going to get through it There's every opportunity, however, to improve the writing. I don't just reject documents out of hand if there's an opportunity to make the, if the subject matter, interesting and I'll work with the authors sometimes helping them rewrite things so that it becomes more readable But in the end, if it's just not, if it's so far away that, that, or it, for so that it becomes more readable. But in the end, if it's just not, if it's so far away that, for whatever reason, it can't be made more readable, then gets rejected Sometimes I'll reject things because the reviewers come back and say, hey, this is not an appropriate technology approach or it could harm the internet is another good reason I've had reviewers come back and say, hey, this has real congestion control problems, and I have chosen not to publish based on that.

Finally, if the IPR is such that I believe that the publication of the document actually wouldn't serve the community, either because people who use it would have to pay a lot of money, that's going to weigh considerably negatively towards publication publication In addition to the independent stream, there are other venues to publish So it's not like I'm the only show in town right? The ice stream is one of many different ways to publish When I receive a document, one of the first questions I'm going to ask is just that, is this really appropriate? for an independent stream? If not, I'll work with the authors to try and find a good place So, oftentimes, that will be the IETF Almost every document I receive get serious consideration as to where this, which work group might be interested in this or which area might be interested in this.

It's not for me Sometimes RFCs are required for publication but not standards. So if it's not an ARR, if it's for publication, but not standards.

I'll talk about that in a moment to see where that discussion goes. But if a RFC is required, that point authors and developers in a little bit of catch-22.

I also ask for a crypto panel review, and I do get those.

I think like you, they're very hesitant to just sort of take one in, but that's not a solid no from them either. And I'm not speaking for Iiana. I just sit next to them a lot. Right.

I understand you're using that as a clarification It sounds more like disagreement to me. Okay, well, no, I think it's a clarification. I'll just answer it this way.

If somebody tried to write down what the, to say, here's the essence answer your question with an example, right? If somebody tried to write down what the, to say, here's the SM2-SM-3 algorithms, for instance. Here's what here's their description, and only the description of those algorithms. We don't have the expertise to do the proper review for that. And so as an negative example, that would be an example. But the application of SM2, SM3, as relates to the the expertise to do the proper review for that. And so as a negative example, that would be an example. But the application of SM2, SM3, as relates to in the DNS SEC context, that more appropriate in the RFC series, I think as an example. Okay one more thing, Elliot, I wanted to ask, you mentioned your editorial board a couple of times. Oh, yeah But if you could maybe speak a little bit more about how that operates, and if you can nominate some of the people who are on that, I think that would be interesting folks. So who room.

Now I realize that's a, that's an imprecise answer so I'm actually looking to follow what's going on in SAG for that to get a more clarifying answer. But we discussed right, that, you know, having this sort of open competitions and open review and those sort of things you know, if that's the direction SAG takes, the chance are that the independent submissions editor is likely to comport himself to that view. I'm independent, but I'm not isolated, right? If the security area is coming up with good requirements, and good policy, how much? isolated, right? If the security area is coming up with good requirements and good policy, how am I going to differ from that? So that's why I'm sort of taking my lead from them, you know, in terms of the approach.

So the, we've already covered, you know the points about alternate, alternate viewpoint I think that's better served by something else these days unlike when this stream was first created Another one is interoperability i think at this point saying that you need an rfc for interoperability is wrong in my view. I would say the document process of writing documents is good for a trial interoperability, but the RFC itself is actually bad for a interoperability because it's immutable. Once you've published, it, you can't fix any bugs. So I'll give one example close to my heart, which was HTTP 3. We launched it to the work in every major browser and a bunch of places without publishing the RFC We launched it when we published RFC 9000, which was the RFC for Quick, and we said the RFC for HTTP3 is blocked on some other things. It doesn't matter We didn't need it for interoperability at all another reason to publish on the independent stream is INA registries A while back, IETF policy on our registries was we have change control and we don't want that ideas into our protocol registries so we will force an RFC we will force you know IETF consensus, we have all these registration policies the IETF has vastly moved away from that now we generally have much laxer, like, specificity required expert review, which in my view is a much better idea because what happens when you put hurdles in front of people who want code points, they just squat on a code point and go about their day. Now we have something much more collaborative which removes the floor but prevents conflicts between code points So INA registries, another historical reason for the independent stream that really no longer applies.

That's been working for us saying that we have now a new way to do that with less review and less consensus doesn't seem helpful And as long as we fix INR registries, we don't need to publish those cryptographic algorithms because we have a solution for interoperability that exists already and we have a solution for the INA registry So based on these points to me, like the reasons for publishing RFCs on the independent stream are like way smaller I agree with a lot of folks who came before me. And so my proposal would be to significant reduce the scope of the independent stream to perhaps just people fools our Cs. It's a cute thing that a lot of us like And like we said, I agree with the points that having jon peterson and requiring them to be amazing at their job is not how we should be running things like at work we call that a bus factor. It's risky for anyone organization and it's sign of a process failure but if it only jon peterson that's responsible for humor, I'm okay with that, and I think Elliot's funny And so as an IAB member, I would say that we could publish RFCs that other peterson that's responsible for humor. I'm okay with that. I think Elliot's funny. And so as an IAB member, I would say that we could publish RFCs that update the independent stream editor model and all that And I would commit that assuming there is some sense of consensus within the community, though that's what we want I'm happy to help and work on the AIB to update those documents"

It's not a standard, but if you want to understand how Cisco meets this requirement, this is how Cisco does it And as a response, it was information to the community that was definitely part of an existing diet dialogue.

But I don't think that the people who wrote those documents thought at the time that they were a bad idea and in some cases here we're seeing documents being published that there is if not consensus that it's a bad idea, certainly a lack of consensus that it is a good idea which is not necessarily the same thing, but looks somewhat alike in some cases Having a place that those descending views, and I've alike in some cases. Having a place that those descending views and I very much value the sorts of things that have been set into terms of interoperability Ted's examples of this is how Cisco does it and this is how it differs from the thing that you may see on the standards track is a very valuable contribution One of the things I've observed recently is that the consent degree that Microsoft had during the early 2000s, led to a great set of documents that they produced documenting exactly how their products differed from the in standards Very meticulous and precise and all of which were hosted on something, something Microsoft.com.

And to a point that's been raised elsewhere like if if someone's going to have an alternative publication modality and have the wherewithal to publish something outside the IETF stream and also get the permit, and archival nature, like national governments surely have that capability So here we have a case where there's a clear conflict of branding. It doesn't have the broad consensus that people understand an RFC to have And there's a viable alternative way to get this information out there. So I think this is a case where it seems that there's clear arguments against this being in the RFC series and I think that's the origin of a lot of concern around these national crypto concerns Thanks, Wes wes hardaker. I will take Adrian's comment that he wished the IAB members in the room would stand up and say what we were looking for. I will do that by saying what I'm looking for, right? So it is the response to the of the IAB to appoint an ISE"

I think there are many times where the ISC gives an early indication that we need to change our publication architectures in some way or another to accommodate a need that we didn't, you know, foresee previously. To me, um, don't think we need an RFC per code point I don't think we need an ISE, RFC, I don't think we need you know, what we need is a bigger code point table Unfortunately, for some protocols, that's no longer possible So to some extent, I think one of the major jobs of the ISC is to actually give us an indication of, you know, the current standards process is not working for this area Let's fix that so we don't need the ISE as much No offense to Elliot, right?

Thanks, Brian. I've just been trying to go through it to go through and work out what the properties are of the IEC that make it worth publishing there because every single person who can get to the point of interacting with the IAC and going through the publication process can whack something up on the internet that's readable by everybody So the idea that someone else can read your work is not a reason to have things published through IAC This is what I came up with. Editorial assistance. I think that's actually quite valuable. The work that the editorial team does, assisting in creating a better quality publication than I could write myself would be a reason to publish through IAC Prior art evidence, this is the value of having it public somewhere that you can refer to and a few of these things are that there's a central place that you can point to and the dates that it was published is clear that there's an evidentiary chance and that also goes for archival that you're document will retain will law long than a regular web page most web pages from 20 years ago are not accessible anymore if you've published something sort of the IAC, it's still available 20 years later. And reference There are IANA registries that say, you need to have a published document that can be referred to and that won't disappear. So they're the things that I think add value but there's another big thing that people go to the other and that is the RFC brand And I think there's a really strong argument that the IAC should not have the RFC brand on it. I don't see any benefit for that other than trying to launder your document and pretend that it has the IETFs brand value associated to it and that it is a legitimate IETF document. I think we take that away"

I'm still looking I'm still listening for constructive feedback as to how I can do my job better I'm hoping to get out of this. I did want to make a comment of comments, though, informationally about how the stream has worked in relation to the other streams because I think that that's something that needs a little more clarity here Sometimes the streams are looking to the independent stream so that they can document things without having to go through a consensus process And a good example of that has been the have been there been information documents where for example, in PANRG"

Now, we can say, well, the IRTF should redo their processes to allow for that or push that back to the RFF. That's one approach.

Thank you Thanks, Colin Hi colin perkins with new hats People keep talking about the role of the independent stream as an escape health I'd like to understand what people mean by that because it seems to be a largely theoretical use of the stream rather than an actual use of the stream I was just looking at what's been published on the independent stream in the last few years, the last decade or so And there seems to be very few if any, RFCs published on the independent stream that critique what the IETF is doing or that publish an obviously dissenting view to what the AIF is doing. I see crypto algorithms. I see RFCs describing particular company's protocols. I see April 1st RFCs, and I see RFCs, and I see RFC publishing something where the IETF has no consensus to publish it When we say an escape valve, do we mean we want to publish? things the IETF has declined to publish?"

An example that I was involved with was the TLS, DNS chain document that is published in the independent stream. It wasn't that the TLS worker group was against it. It was just that they didn't want to speak more time on it. There were two parties that did not agree and they couldn't reach an agreement, and the TLS working group just said, like, please discuss elsewhere. We don't want to spend time on this And so this is, I think, an example of like one of these escape Pete I should have thought of the first sentence before I stood up It seems that there are two competing things being discussed here that I really wish would be separated. There's the value of the ISC, which I think Colin was just talking about And maybe it has or Braun, and maybe it has positive value, maybe it has negative value I think that's an interesting question. And then there's the value of the RFC series, which seems like a very independent question And the value of the market of the term RFC and I don't know whether this form is the right one for the latter question It seems to be embedded in a lot of the comments The idea that the reason we're going through all of the machinations about the ISE"

Another point, Elliot, since you were asking for feedback, speaking completely as an individual, contributor, I would say the one bit of feedback, would be publish fewer RFCs for the reasons that I've mentioned above And for, we've been talking before about kind of the market value RFCs, or I would even say the brand"

Thanks, Mark So starting off with a couple of things I kind of really pursue this to a lot of time when I was on the IESG. So I do have some inputs that kind of got lost at that point One of them was that term thing that I heard like Adrian is well aware of all these things, right? So I did actually suggest, like, we should go off the RFC label for these things, right? That is actually I wrote a proposal for the whole thing. And one of the comments we got back was RFC RFC brand doesn't belong to the IETF. I think somebody needs to go pursue that, Elliot. Maybe that's something you need to go look at like does the IETF own the RFC brand? Because I back was the RFC brand doesn't belong to the IETF. I think somebody needs to go pursue that, Elliot. Maybe that's something you need to go look at, like does the IETF own the RFC brand? Because it was news to me and, but it's something probably we want to chase down. Yeah, go ahead The RFC label doesn't belong to the ice either. So I think it's a broad discussion. I understand, but like, you know, I think like get off my lawn thing doesn't really work hard if it's not our lawn. So that is my part But so like aside from that, there's like some things that kind of poison the pool a little bit. Okay. I'll give you an example. The reason I started looking at this was RFC 79 that, there's like some things that kind of poison the pool a little bit. Okay, I'll give you an example. The reason I started looking at this was RFC 7974, which actually went through conflict review The IAJ said like don't publish this and it got published, right? And that was kind of in the bad, RFC category at some point but I think one of the things that it's a feedback for you earlier is like give us some visibility into your queue so what are the documents that have been submitted to you?

So that and now as to its state, there are several different states in terms of whether I'm looking for reviewers or, um, the document needs to be updated. I wanted to talk, let me answer just one other thing from Martin I do use the I word a little more than I should. The reviewers really do most of the work I just, you know, in terms of really delving into the content and I really just evaluate their I do a lot of evaluation of the, again, the preponderance and reviews. Thank you. Thank you. And as a positive word, Elliot, I think you've been dying really good job of soliciting a lot of reviews from the people who are like relevant to that thing.

Like so, but I think it's something you need to evaluate but I personally appreciate that you're trying to get more review from people in the know for that thank you So folks can keep their, comments two minutes we'd appreciate that or less.

The perception of the brand different depending upon what demographic you're looking at The vast majority of the 8 billion humans in this biore have never heard of an RFC, don't know, don't care, right? People even in the networking business an awful lot of them, have the vaguest of notions of what an RFC is. If they have at least some notion, I think they do perceive it as a rather strong brand reflecting some quality Then those of us who've been involved in the IETF have perhaps a more acute awareness of the wide variance in quality of something that has the RFC brand And I'd like to suggest that we have lots of other tagging mechanisms, BCP, standard, etc cetera, that we have been rather loath to use in the last few years for reasons that are not entirely clear to me Great, thank you.

So things like how Eliot's choosing, you know, making good choices to operate the stream to these considerations about alternative publication venues, confusion with other streams, RFCs And I think the IAB right now could start up a document to encode those constraints in trying RFCs. And I think the IAB right now could start up a document to encode those constraints and try and constrain the ISE, articulate its role more clearly, articulate what it is and is not supposed to be doing So I would propose that as, you know, something for our honorable IAB members to get started up I would be happy to contribute to such a thing might be a good thing for a little program.

The second thing that I think I take, from this meeting is that document about documenting how the ICE function works a little more And I think at least that can start as an independent submission in terms of saying, here's the way the ice works today"

Yeah I would love to hear from that. I think actually maybe the IAB might like to hear from that too in terms of which ones really have caused harm, which ones have helped you know, which ones maybe didn't make a difference. Yeah, I'd love, I think that would be great feedback And finally, the other threat of the discussion is the so-called national crypto issue, and it sounds like the home for that discussion is still missing the security area. It's certainly a adjacent to this, and there's implications, but that seems like the follow-up as far as I'm aware. Yeah, so from my perspective I will still try to process the documents that come through One thing that I have done in the for crypto in particular, that I will put a big statement in documents that that are crypto related basically saying, hey, this, you know, this stock, you know, use it your own risk is essentially big warning signs. And I can, you know, people are interested you can look at the latest crypto RFCs from, from Ghost, I think the last few.
