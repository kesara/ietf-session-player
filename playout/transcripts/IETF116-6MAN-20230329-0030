This is notable? I I hope it's not the first time you see. I to be honest not sure people can read this, but you can download slides and it. So First of all, just a reminder, please wear masks all the time unless you actively to speaking, let or you too. People who are in and would like to join the queue to ask questions. Please use the on side two using your phone. It does help chairs to manage the queue. Much easier to manage one virtual use than trying to track was in the q first. So if you are using full client in the room or remote. Please give your video audio would turn off. Until your actually start presenting or asking questions. That's probably it for the useful tips for the medium. We obviously have chat, which will be monitored and during the session. And by the way, if you send anything in the chat room, and you would like ask to relays and the Mic... Please make it clear."

We have two individual drafts and time per meeting we might have a brief short announcement about generalized type tunnels about side music, which just happened. Any last minute agenda comments suggestions three two one sold. So since the last meeting, what happened? Rf of nine three four three has been published. Great congratulations to authors. We have one document which is currently with. I don't know Eric would you like to comment out on this? Because I think you have the most information. Yeah. This document came to a tele. And had some discussions. We had a meeting yesterday morning with one of the discuss holders and some some reviewers. There's some audio feedback. That's interesting. It seems like we explained some of the background to some of the reviewers. Who had some some issues. We got some more feedback on what browser implement in particular are concerned about.

So that's actually what's gonna happen next There were some other proposed ways to move forward, but I don't know that we need to worry about them until we have some kind of a wet review first. I think of the proposals was to change this document status to experimental, but that means we'd be updating proposed standard with experimental. Which could be done with an Announcement right up. Another proposal was to read revisit changing the syntax, but I don't think we should do that. Until we know that there's actual some kind of a path forward because, otherwise, it's a bit, like bring me a rock. No. Different rock. So That's that's essentially where that's at at the moment. Any questions? Yeah. Thank. Thank you, Eric. So another draft which we still trying twelve is sid yes. So I guess should is ready to give us last update because... Yeah, it was kind... We were ...talking into to spring group about that but between meetings during to some mis miscommunication, we haven't wait much of progress until this week. Yeah Thank you, Jim. Thanks for following up on this. So the the Christ, I think the the current working plan is to take out issues from the draft and put it into a issue tracker in spring for the Caesar draft, And then, like, the editor, like, you know, darren in the room if he wants to comment, like, to kind of pick up the things and see the edits. I think Bob's point us, he wanted to see the edits in the draft and kind of, like, you know, follow on that on this spring on the spring draft. But I think like, in only clear the site from the six months that as long as like Eric, kind of keeps the handle on the six spring and it's getting made. That's it. Like, so there's no formal like, linkage of this thing, but kind of make sure that"

So as as said, we have five working group documents four of them will be discussed today. And just a reminder, I think we mentioned it last time in London So we sometimes receive a lot of draft from Other american group when a working group are trying to use Ip six so they might require some protocol development like bits and of new options, most on So what we're trying to do to optimize the workflow is six months would prefer to work on draft related to other Groups after that work group confirmed that's the sufficient interest. What what we mean is draft in the working group being adopted or chairs communicated. That they believe it's in scope and of interest interest for the European group. So please if like you have some draft for six months or review. Please make sure that the related working group or area has a spread. So I think that's eat both put all any comments or any comments from the room. Okay. Okay. In this case, I guess we can move to the first presentation"

So that you can be used by the trends node to determine the of how belongs tool and then the specific packet processing of forwarding behaviors can be performed. When we introduced term and actually we mean it is something in contrast to the vpn, which is in the overlay.

With this encoding actually we take the data in processing overhead and the complexity into the consideration. You can see that the recording has been stable for the whole option. And we just need to use the city to indicate the lens and the cement kicks. And for each specific city type, the lens of the vic Id is also fixed. So they will be very helpful for the to present it in the fast pass Okay. Next slide, please. I see in the previous version of the traveler have been introduce some introducing some considerations about how to the semantics.

In our understanding the Of meeting Id can refers to group of the network right attributes, which I may contained on the involved in the.

So you never go to a network node, which does not support this. At the same time, we know that to the assessment route specifies the modified procedure for the processing of the Header.

You know, on the one hand, we work on a problem statement document that was put in the b stops working group, and it was published by us. Rc eighty nine seventy eight. That's the current statement for Slack flashing numbering. Then we also need another document on the basic stops working group. Nineteen ninety six with recommendations for customer edge. Routers, which ended up updating C seventeen eighty four. And this document that we are discussing today is essentially or aims to be like, a a specification update.

I say a lot of of of the work being done already, probably. Next slide, So if if you haven't been, you know, following the know the the progress of this document closely. Essentially, we started with an individual contribution and what we were doing over time was like, you know, grab pieces from the original document, the individual contribution. And, you know, discussing that each base on the you know, on the main list and on different Meetings. And, you know, moving each one piece of at the time, you know, obviously considering comments from, you know, from the working group both on the meeting on the on the mailing list.

And I believe that we have, you know, briefly, you know, simplified the the algorithm in question. Next slide. So this is kind of like the, you know, the the timeline of, you know, the way which the... You know, the algorithm works but, know actually, the the concept is, like in simpler this diagram. And the the idea is is super simple. The idea is that as you receive advertisement participant messages, you will essentially record which piece of information was advertised by local router. Okay? The idea is that if eventually, you receive an ra array on that Ra is missing the information that had been previously advertised by the same router then that's probably an indication that, you know, information. The configuration information has changed. So what you want to do obviously, in order to cope with possible packet loss and so on, is to just call the that local folder with the us root solicitation, and based the response that you get, you know, if that if the corresponding good advertisement, we refresh information, then, you know, information is current. There's nothing that you need to do. You keep all the information business usual. But on the other hand, even when you pull the local water with the protest solicitation, actually even in the response. You still get, you know, the missing information, or you still miss the information that that router had previously advertised then you consider that the information has become stable. And we simply this associate, you know, that information with the with the advertising router. Obviously, you need to keep in mind that, you know, there's is, like in the case of, you know, multi prefix multi you know, rotor environments"

    "text": "essentially, there's an rf, you know, of the... But by Brian Carpet and free baker or Don't remember the, you know, our c number of the top of my head, but it essentially already, you know, suggests that, you know, you should do that. Like, you know, remember which piece of information has been advertised by which local water. So if you look at the sky, you know, potentially, you received I a. And what we want to do with that piece that you see in, you know, violet or whatever that color call. We will wait for a couple of seconds. Obviously, this specific values is in in the draft And this is just code with at least they theoretical case that we haven't seen in, you know, in the real world, but the theoretical case where a local router might split the configuration information into multiple packets. So rather than you know, reacting to the first ra, we want to wait for a couple of seconds because at least in theory, you know, the local router might split the configuration if information into, you know, multiple packets. So after these are wait time value, like, after you have waited for, say three seconds, then what you do is you check whether there is any information that the same router have previously advertised but it's not in this last batch of information that was advertising. Is like, these rotor was advertising something that now it looks like not advertising anymore. So then will wait for random fine. I mean, that this doesn't really change the concept at all. This piece in the middle in orange or whatever that color is. It's just to avoid like, multiple local cost to be to get synchronized at the same, you know, un send approval at the same moment. That's the only thing that thing is doing. And then when we get into the yellow part of this, what we do is just send a rotor solicitation And we wait for some period of time, you know, a few seconds. To wait for the possible responses, which would be these r broke time. Part. Like, the to interface between the, you know, the yellow bar and the Red part."

    "text": "So when you get to that board, essentially, you have two different possibilities. Option one is that actually, the information is still current. So all of the information has been refreshed and there's nothing to discard business as usual, or there's option two that maybe when you... So there was missing information, meaning configuration information has changed. And The information was missing in the original ra it's also missing now that you have sent a gas who the solicitation probe to the local to the local router. If that is the case, so the information is still missing what you want to do is this to say that piece of information with the advertising powder. What I'm saying, you know, this associated with this advertising router is because if there were, like multiple routers on the local network segment, advertising information, you just don't want to remove the whole information. You're just saying okay. This router is not that information anymore. So the face of that information will depend on whether other routers advertising in that information or not. If other systems are advertising it, the the information stays there, but if there no other router advertising this information, then you should face that information out. Next slide? So this is the algorithm in cellular code as know, as in the in the current rough draft, essentially would have, you know, in this slide is the event when an r is received, essentially for every know, piece of information, what you do is you record the current time. Meaning you always want to know when was the last time that a piece information was advertised. And essentially, if there is missing information in this bucket, and you have not refreshed the information lately"

And essentially, we enable this mode. Again, We just receive an incoming Ra will record a time stamp of when the information was last received and even calling Ra, contains missing information. So their stuff that was advertised by the this you before, but it's not being advertised now, we want to get into their life events mode or in other words, we want to, you know, prove the local router to see this information is really gone or maybe it was just sent in a different packet and it was lost on the way. Okay? Next slide? So This part is actually this case looks like slightly more complex because we're are considering two things. Like on on the one hand, we are considering that you know, configuration information may included or maybe fit into multiple buckets. That's one thing. And we are also making the algorithm general enough but if you want to all the router, more than once, you can do it. Okay? So in the... You know, in the in the first image that I that I cover that I shared with you, essentially, we were assuming just a single, you know, our group. But for multiple reasons, you might want to say well, when I want to verify whether the information is current or not. I don't want just to send a single rule their solicitation. I might want to send two three, whatever the number is. Okay? So this part of the algorithm is trying to cope with that. But still, it's super simple. So when you are in this lifetime that I avoid you know, more. Like, you... We refreshing are verifying whether the information current or not.

We send more than one route solicitation when that time has elapsed, then what we have to do is if there is information that is still missing, know has not been refreshed just this associate that information with the local router. Again, the fate of that information will depend on whether that information is being advertised but all the route or not. So it could be advertised by multiple routers. And if only one of the routers is cease the advertisement of that information, we just say, okay, these router is not advertising this information anymore about you know, we might keep this information because other the routers keep advertising it. So yellow, which Just say, you know, the test phase is over, The refresh price is it's over. Anything that has not been refreshed, we, you know, face that information out because it's daily information. And then what we have essentially in green, it's just checking you know with like, you know, charcoal body which, of course, are all the file in the you know, in the in the draft.

And it requires working on a bunch of implementations, sort of fork off a bunch of information essentially duplicating it by every router right now, like like, right now, the semantics of a particular piece of information are like, whenever you get it, you store it. But now you have to, like, actually store everything that everybody sent you. Just because you think you might... Just you because you think that guy might for get it. Right? So I think it's like very complicated. And I'm not sure it's actually very useful in most cases because We know that in most networks, that actually have this memory loss problem.

The hour rule is clearly a asbestos and we have a lot of trouble with it right now. We wanna get rid of it, but it's really hard because we have to update an sort of a four eight sixty one Right? So I would really I would really try to sort of be a little bit less ambitious. And maybe if you really want to to to to specify that hosts need to like try to help root when they forgotten. I think we should say I think we should have more general notes rather than put a specific algorithm into here because I think, you know, this this R is gonna last whatever years. And lot of implementations may not be able to do this easily. Right? So Yeah. Another point I have is sort of more tactical is I think the suggested lifetimes assume low packet loss and this is not the case. So on a typical mobile device on a Wi Network, you will at least fifty percent packet loss from Multi cost, typically much more. And so you this the current, like, the current guidance in there I think will break most devices today most mobile devices today. Because you'll send away fewer Oh or rather, you'll like to lower the lifetime And anyway, just plan for plan for mobile devices in the field. Experiencing at least sixty sixty six percent packet loss for ra arrays. And and rerun that through your algorithm. Another example of why this is kind of overs specified because this is very implementation dependent. It depends on, like the generation of the device, the type of Wi then the power saving technology. So again, try not to specified. Where what this all means for last call? I don't know."

You your draft in your presentation seem to be using term configuration information. Received by a host. Right? Yeah. What exactly does it mean?

This document talks about when it refers the configuration information, that is, route information options and the two Dns options. Dns server and being a search list.

One them I wanna echo what Lorenzo said, about the algorithm, I'd be very concerned. Having tested lots of implementations about trying to implement that algorithm in there. Think that's a little aggressive and maybe we could come up with other ways to solve that problem. My second comment is you changed a lot of the lifetime I think is interesting. The only thing here is I would put some text in there talking about a lot of routers are getting their information from prefix lifetimes. From Ia. And you don't have any text in there about you should shorten the time or do anything with that. I don't know if you wanna change the Pd. Default life I don't think you need to, but I think you should definitely talk about Hey, if you're learning this stuff automatically, you probably wanna shorten it if it's over x amount of time, something like that. Yeah. That's a third point You. Eric on Mike. Yes that's sort of similar concerns around complex in. So trying to solve the multi prefix multi router it's hard.

So you don't necessarily wanna trigger this stuff unless you think that there's a need to to sort of flush up information prematurely. Right? And... Because we don't want introduce accidentally introduce from operational ability that isn't there today in in those sort of simpler cases So have you looked at this? Just part of it. Yeah. So I have not seen myself, but I have no that I I mean what I'm saying, like, I haven't seen it myself, which means it might exist, I just have an experienced that the case where, you know, there's, like, a cases where you know, the router cease to types a piece of information advertise a different thing and the previous information is valid. But this is what I've seen. I'm not saying that that doesn't exist. So the cases is where, you know, Yeah. But but but what causes you you sort of get into the mode of saying need to rev rev information by sending Rs as etcetera. Or customer Yeah. So your algorithm, what we say is we keep a track of what these local, the information that the local router was advertising. For example, was advertising see some perfect. Okay? Now that prefix is not advertised anymore. We keep hearing from the local router, but it's now advertised a different time. We not hearing from that there anymore about that information.

No only one known implementation has on five dot five suggests that this is really hard to implement. As well. Agree that we should do it. But that's another point that that should give us pause with the complicated, like, lifetime avoidance algorithm. Five dot five doesn't even require you to send any gets all it does is, like, store the information correctly. And we... Even that's not implemented in Linux and an Ios. Right? This algorithm is like, well, you know, I forgot this. Okay. Let me send the packet and receipt of this is alright. Let's check. Let me set some time that's super complicated.

There were fairly minor changes from version one So one of them is the disclaimer that the mechanisms to determine when a limit can be exceeded. Those are out of the scope for the draft. So you can imagine that when we're trying to send packets with extension headers that exceed one of the specified limits. It's okay to do as long as the sender knows that it's safe to do. The mechanisms for finding whether or not it's safe, are basically out scope for the draft although that we do. Get some general recommendations for that. We also reference the hub processing draft particularly pertinent I think it's the handling of the high order two bits for an unknown option. We added a motivation that allows an intermediate up node to stop hub option processing and forward a packet"

Next slide, please. So I wanted to cover one of the areas had enough meeting with Bob and gory about the the draft and the hop By hop. Processing draft. So one of the statements I think Were made was that we wanted to make sure the motivation for the specific options it's clear. Wanna cover those today is kind of the bulk of the presentation. So the first one that I wanna address with the default number of non padding options. So in the draft we specified that nodes By default can send up to eight hop or destination options, non padding options, and a packet with the expectation that that's safe to do and the receiver either won't be able to process all of those or at least be able to process some subset or or none of them. So the reason we came up with eight, it is a manifest constant So we have to demonstrate somehow it's future proof. So the analysis showed that in the history of Ip six, I believe there's only been thirteen non d non padding options to find. The rate of adding new options seems like it is increasing. However,"

    "startTime": "00:58:03",
    "text": "we also have to consider these are really options that would be used primarily on the Internet for limited domains Yeah, as They said in previous presentations, if you're sending into a eliminate domain, it's much easier to go beyond the limits that we're recommending here. So this is really the default options are for unknown networks the Internet itself internet or domain where we don't know exactly what capabilities are So at the rate of adding new options is very low. We also have some anecdotal evidence that hardware like p four could handle up to eight options it's potentially possible to put those in a cam, though I think that that would be a little difficult. But we are looking at some implementations that can get parallel it seems like a pretty good number. It's low enough that we could actually para that. So the conclusion that the draft came up with is that eight is sufficiently future proof So it's not too restrictive. And on the other hand, it does seem reasonably feasible. And again, the the value is just the limit for sending not the limit for processing for the limits for processing as is draft and the hopper health processing address specified. All nodes or any node could actually ignore all the hop I have options, or they could process before it's continuous set of them. Next slide, please. The padding options with defaults this is a little more straightforward. All this really required was looking, what is the real use case of padding And the conclusion was it's just for alignment of options primarily. There may be some other use cases"

    "startTime": "01:00:03",
    "text": "again, I think those would be outside of the normal limits And somebody wanted to use padding for instance to make a packet larger that's fine as long as there are they understand the consequences of the path and it's safe to do. So the defaults that we came up with maximum the seven bytes that means we can align up to an eight bite field with seven bytes of of padding. And also the other part of that is only one padding option and one contiguous padding option allowance. So pad one, one byte of option that end can give the two to seven. So as I said, there's no practical reason to do this. Also this really isn't an issue for networking stacks that are sourcing options it's very they're easy and probably much prefer to send a minimal amount of padding. It's less processing on the sender. Next slide, please. So the third motivation is the Ip v six header chain link. This all the limits described in ind really is the one that is most the hardest requirement. Would say in terms of be an actual requirement because it does affect the receivers on the Internet in particular, requirement is that intermediate nodes can process at least a hundred and twenty eight by header. And this really has to do with those nodes that have to process the transport layer header. So what is basically saying is we expect that there could be a hundred and twenty eight bytes of Ip six header chain, And if those notes have to look into the transport layer, they should be able to handle that. So the rationale for hundred twenty eight bytes comes from First of all, evidence in the field."

    "text": "We do know that hundred and twenty eight bytes are fairly comment. And this was a result of some of the kind of ad hoc information gathering we had when we did some of the tunnel lane exploration of of here is back. Many devices already processing encapsulation. So if your process and encapsulation, there they will have to by definition be processing more than the Ip v six header so that already puts us. Deeper in. The question then, assuming that that's a sufficient minimum, should we have a larger default size One thing I would note is, there's already other limitations to this. In particular Rc c nine thousand quick. Some cases, we'll limit extension headers to thirty two bytes anyway. So with the hundred and twenty eight by chain header chain length, by the way, that implies that the maximum extension header size sixty four bytes. So it's a little bigger than the the quick limit. But again, the rationale here is we expect that notes intermediate nodes on the internet can minimally be able to process this without dropping the packet or without causing detrimental behavior like bad routing. Next slide, please. So that being said, we did post version two of the draft. There were not a lot of comments on the list last It we did address several comments, particularly from Brian Carpenter. Also we will obviously continue to work with the hub by processing draft. I think they're gonna have kind of bidirectional norma references.

Effectively means we couldn't send any help options because you have to account for the And the parsing buffer have to account for the Ethernet header deputy Fifty six header and at least four bytes of transport protocol also puts you up to at least fifty four bytes there.

Extension headers good force they transport layer two deep in the packet. Mh. So I I don't know if we have data on that. I think it's it's definitely a real problem. Some of the empirical data does indicate that that there are still nodes that are very conservative and will drop packets almost any extension headers. So I don't know how we could solve. That But in case, think maybe that would be a good discussion to how on the list is anymore of the specifics of that. So like I said, I don't think the empirical data has been gathered for really making a a specific judgment. Like I said, there there is anecdotal data. Towards this. I do think that having a minimal requirement in general is a good idea. We need to give the vendors some sort of guidance here and think one of the major problem is we haven't given them the guidance.

So be aware where you have a different processing path. We added small block of text that says lords should have process the hot hotmail help option header. It was always our intent to say this.

Maybe there reason the document I just missed it But if we are suggesting that further habits might be ignored, could we actually make the recommendation to just include a single one, Otherwise, you'll be in situations where they people include multiple, at the end of day, you don't know what's going to happen with the second third and, you know, whatever. Yeah. You what's gonna happen with the first deal. So I'm not sure that limiting this to one really is a great thing. You really will strain what route vendors will actually put in their products, which means you will only get one. Ever. That is correct, but that's still better to down. The feature not working at all. I agree what you're saying. But on the other hand, this if you don't constrain it, like, you know, right now, your people could, you know, create, like, a one k extension hair chain, but, yeah, well that doesn't work. In theory, they can. And you have not constrained them, but practice you get nothing. So I rather settle for something that works I supposed to lie you in in theory, everything could work but in practice, I cannot use the feature. That that's where I'm coming from at, least. But this is just an idea. Okay. I hear I hear... I hear your questions and that we don't have real answers to these because I'm not sure we want to constrained the way it will evolve in future. So But let think could talk a bit more on list if that's helpful."

We were doing some testing and We've had some host do some really strange things with Hot aka ignore. And I sort of had to walk the vendor through how that works. So we might wanna be careful about the words we use here. I think we you mean router and you definitely need router in the next sentence because you say full. Four forty great. So I I'd be very careful with the words we use here. Because the host vendors will go off and do strange things. Bob, are you able to comment commit on that one? We should use the word notes or routers. Yeah. I think we should go back and take a look at that. I think it's a good comment. Can't Tim... Can I just ask what you mean by ignore? Did you mean none Just stop process or did you mean drop the packet? Okay. So they actually did something horrible and they dropped the entire packet. So I had to explain to them that's not what ignoring the hop By hop option like eighty two hundred. I was a bit horrified. Be completely honest. They, you know, obviously couldn't process the next header. Was that argument is they could ignore the option and then not worry about what followed it? And so I explained it them, like, that's really awful, but I'm scared how many people might read that and do those kinds of strange things. Well, okay. The sentence says if the norm does not process the hot my option header, it must forward the packet normally. Yeah.

So next slide I say, well, this is a companion to a draft that we present b six earlier this week. And it's work with Jen and Chow, who actually also working on the implementation of Pd on and Android. So What is the problem that the Six draft is trying to solve? Well, we have a lot you know, host always have multiple addresses. Right? Meaning like local stable for six four x slack, you need to do numbering. And on some networks, particularly enterprise networks"

    "text": "that's a big problem for infrastructure. I mean, we we know vendors that limit you know, to... Let's say, six or seven p six addresses and just drop everything else. We know of Os is that use more than that on a regular basis and they just don't work. The new addresses don't work. And So that creates a big scaling problem. And the draft in v six ops proposes that used V six Pd for this so that the host can create as many addresses as it once of everything, all of those addresses end end connectivity without having to place any scaling burden on the network. On the other hand, if we do this on smaller networks like home networks, you will basically exhaust the prefix space and home networks because somehow home networks just give you a slash sixty. Mine just gives me a sixty four. So this wouldn't even be possible at Right? So what we're trying to do is we're trying to define a way to tell the host what what prefix allocation mechanism to use? How to form addresses by itself. How to auto configure addresses basically. So this is not a replacement for Slack because it will actually relies on Slack we'll see later on. If you think about this in any way related to what we have today in each six you might see this is a replacement for ia a in enterprise networks. But next slide, please. So what are we talking about here? Pd is actually sort of a a wealth of understood standard. It's r c eighty four fifteen. I don't even know if it's a full standard, but it's definitely very much here. And the standard already supports doing it on hosts. So why do we need to come to six man? Well, Again, we need to communicate to the host whether Pd is supported on this network or encouraged. Right? So And we... So we adding a flag to the That says, if you understand this flag, you can use the h six. Don't bother use Slack on this. Just do Pd get your own prefix."

    "text": "And we need this because in a in an enterprise network that supports bold both existing and new devices, we need to make auto con continue to work. For example, like the Google network, the enterprise network uses auto comp extensively only And if we want to migrate to this, we need to support this flag so that all the devices don't use. Auto. Why does this flag need to be in the Pi instead in the Ira? Well, it's got to be there before you start auto conflict means it's got to be in the R. And also, it's specific to a particular prefix. So for example, some networks might say, might wanna say, well, get a prefix for global connectivity, but use auto con from the. Or more sort of maybe more likely, In a multi humming situation when you have two sort of Pb on link, Different upstream might support, you know, one three might support this and one might not. And so we want to be able to support this and and that... And and hanging it off the Is is sort of a way to do that. Why not do more of this dhcp six itself Well, there's some Ip r that we need to tread carefully around. Somebody wanted to... You yeah, I think a long time ago in if we try to add some some P options at G two six. And there was some Ip r claim that just killed that. And so we we haven't looked into that but, you know, this is... You know, we would need to steer clear that. So next slide. How can you use the delegated prefix? Well it's yours do whatever you want with it. You can create a billion addresses if you want, and it's not gonna cause the network any scaling issues or any pain, and it doesn't matter. You can use this to assign Ip six addresses to internal components, vms containers, whatever you want, docker containers they can all have end end connectivity without that or N six, which I think is a a huge improvement over what we can do in Ip before. This is really not possible in a p before. You can't have a hundred vms on your host. At home"

So this really gives you because this the network will fall over. Right? So this is... I think this is also gives us a meaningful increase in the abilities that we have to do end end connectivity today even compared to Slack. Right? So I think that's important. And also the host May, if permitted by host policy not network policy, it may extend the network. It can send an ra. Internally, it can send in rate to t devices is what we use today for Pb six t. Now people have said, well, I don't want my host to extend the network. But the truth is that's up to the host. The host can do not floor and extend the network as much as it wants. And it can do not exist if it wants There's plenty of implementations. All we're doing is making it so that the host can extend the network without losing end connectivity. Exciting. So there's a few sort of issues here. Right, for example, these three six is not very good at recon configuring things. And so you know, when we we want to make sure that the properties of Slack in terms of remembering and deprecating prefixes and multiple prefixes and so preserved as much as we can. And so we basically that as long as there's any With the p bit set to one on the network, you should keep a d six Pd client running. Anytime that set of prefix changes, you should probably do a bind actually. It's folks have clarified that bind is okay. But basically, kick Pd again to say, okay, like has a new upstream showed up has, you know, do I need to, like, is something become d? Should I like, get more information from the service. And, yeah, again, reconfigure it's very hard you, so it's it's sort of difficult to use this for this purpose. Did you want to ask question now or did you want to go at the end or you? Okay.

But we also don't want define something that won't won't even preserve that ability. And so what we say in the draft is that host must maintain the mapping between the delegated prefix and the root. And we basically say, well, Likely the relay is c with the root. If it is then Assume that the root for the purposes of five to five is assume that the router that gave you that Ip address space is the relay from what you got. The reply the really relay reply. And... Yeah. Why not I see Pb six redirects well. The redirects to source addresses, they also scale very badly because they're specific to a particular destination dress as well and it's just expensive. Next slide. So we really think we're onto to something here and I think it also like gives us a glimmer of hope we can sort of put the D six versus Slack debate behind us one from for all. And in the process also get this new ability to really have Vms with thousands of addresses on our host without c any scaling problems. Right. Think. So we think we're onto something here. And we There was some good feedback in v early in the week and we hope that adoption will be issued this week. And we also would like if that happens, we'd also like six man to adopt this document if we think there's interest. And I think that's it. Maybe, I guess, next slide. Yeah okay. Okay.

I'm not a great expert in Dhcp as you can imagine, but I mean, there's some situations. One actually weakness here that's not mentioned in the slide is is the process of, like, how do you do state sharing between multiple relays? The draft in v six up says, do don't do rapid commit that both relays at least see the not the the request. I don't know if relays plum roots into their f when they see the request maybe they...

Oh, go ahead. Hi. Some of these comments I might have done on the... You know, when you did the presentation on basic So so my apologies if, you know, I just forgot and I'm, you know, repeating them. So I believe that there are some things, you know, some details that, you know, might need to be fleshed out. Like, for example, my expectation is let's say that there's is know, host that normally do dhcp now What is, for example there's a with these said, whatever the bj days. But to, like, you know, manage configuration. Like, I have for example the device at home that when you have bought both set"

So I you know, the language the whole thing would interact, you know, with, you know, okay you can do like, you can do the Hp and you can also do, like, you know, prefix delegation would be great you know, to have it here what's the path in there. Already, for example, if the local router is supporting this, but the horse doesn't to support, what's supposed to be the, you know, the full the the the full back, you know, plan. I don't have a preference myself. But I believe that a clear part in respect you're done, you know, you just connect devices on how clue what's going to be the outcome. Which I have, like, it's already looking located Dhcp and Slack. I just don't want to have, like, yet one more option in which. It things could go in, like, different ways. And the other thing is that when it comes to the, you know, the way the prefixes are assigned. That might require some work. I'm gonna saying this no, and I'm just saying that you know, some details would probably need to be specified because for example, you could get into two situations depending on how you assign the prefixes at that might trigger three events, like the same problems that we were discussing before. So you might want to have like, a way to the same prefix be reassigned like all the time. Considering the case where you have a local router that, you know, just released just granted some prefixes. It reboots loses the estate and so on. So you get the same problem that we already get for, you know, slack and know on Dhcp. With the case that, you know, here it to be delegation. So it's like the remembering problem would happen within the hawk. So I believe that, you know, that's another thing that, you know, should be for about. Yeah. I agree. I mean, I think that the remembering thing is I think already already mostly taken care of by the a suggestion of doing a bind whenever you like something relevant changes for you."

I I would like to quick comment on Fernando coming about number. And actually, this should behave better because the host weeks back host to track prefixes. And when see different prefixes, it showed try to refresh the information. So it's actually colors part of the problem on draft. That's true. Yep. The... The other thing is the expectation that is like if now you assigning prefixes to host, I'm not saying that what we had was super good or even good. But it does... Change the sun that now it's like paid the half is identified by or what you do inside. Now it's like, you know, privacy addresses for example temporary addresses like now they have a different semantics. Again, I'm not saying there a killer. I'm just saying that the considerations changed there. That that is in the v subs. Right? I think the fact that you, like, privacy implications, for example, yes, sorry am there. Yes. But I mean, remember, part of this is to is to like, try to find some compromise with the folks that say Ia is the only way to assign addresses. Right?

At yeah, I think some of this is really just if you want more information, how do you go about asking for it?
