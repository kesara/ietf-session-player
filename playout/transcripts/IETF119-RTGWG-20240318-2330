Close to be done, but there is a really significant amount of command. So We will need also to figure out how to continue with it one of couters has become, AD, So, We will work with, the rest of, routers. And if someone wants to help with it, more than welcome. Net to cloud, general consensus so working group plus call is done. We've got last, set up commands from, set gear after, LinkedIn calls as addressed, we will submit the document to LSG. And the VRRP point to multipointbv depending early review. So it's in progress. Agenda for today. So as you know, starting from IETF on 17, we cochure subscribers, we will start to running site meeting called, AI in data center, become very, very popular we have not have recording for first one, unfortunately, died somewhere in Webex. This recording for, 118. We don't do it this idea because of difference in times, we really couldn't get people to present 4 o'clock in the morning.

Number 2, when you lose a link in start of 5th stage, you actually don't lose reachability. You reduce amount of bandwidth available.

The proposal that we'll be taking forward and providing at least, you know, some sketch out is Provide the glueware but the, notes know what their upstream members are and the provided dynamic signaling layer that allows for the ECMPs that'd be dynamically tuned outside of routing.

It I think will all benefit if the problem definition comes out to be a little more clearer If you need conversions, which is less than some 50 milliseconds, what are you seeing? What kind of topologies it is because while you can tune protocols to get there. Certainly, for soft something less than soft 50 milliseconds, you need to do this outside the control plane. And there has been interest work going on in different bodies. Like, I'll try to track consortium where they can actually are working towards predicting failures or trying to get around the failure parts.

One of the previous IETF meetings, which is endpoint based throughout for us, which uses retranspin time outs, and floor labels or actually any kind of entropy in the protocol headers, it can detect and drop around failures, on the order of 100 milliseconds may be faster. Basically, it depends on an output time in the network and, in type of call data center network if we don't have folk use, round trip times, really small, and such approach, has, a very significant is that it's completely orthogonal to the outer mechanisms. And it also works in case of gray failures. Thank you so. If I remember correctly, the talk was named silklin Matrox with flow labels. Thanks, Dimas.

So drop that has the worker has started for a long time at least 10 years So there must be many discussions and, many comments received So so are there any places to track these, discussions or issues so that we can, track whether the issues have been, fully, sold or someone has been fully solved And that will be helpful for the adoption, maybe. So the work has started in routing work group almost 10 years ago just, search in the mailing list and, all the communication is there. If you don't find an answer on the mailing list, you can always ask. Yeah. And And now the questions, If not, Thank you. Thank you."

This is work in progress. There's lots of changes going on. Not set in stone in any way. So, please, if you see something amiss Please bring it up. I'm an engineer. This is not marketing. Are no pretty pictures here. A routing guy, not a satellite guy, If I get the satellite stuff wrong, Please tell me. There are lots of ways of solving this. There's other ideas that people are bouncing around. This is only one. Let's see. No satellite operators have commented on this. They were not abused. And they have not abused me. So I am operating with without a lot of free feedback here. This is a discussion please feel free to interrupt. So satellite networks today look a little bit like this. We have the internet. We've got maybe a little terrestrial network. We've got a local gateway. It's got a big satellite dish It talks to a bunch of satellites. And the novel thing that's happening today is we now have intersatellite links. And this is where the routing, it gets interesting. We actually are using free space opt between satellites. And so Thanks, sir. Flaky. From those satellites, then you bounce down to user stations. And the most common application for doing all of this is to form an access network. So that's where this talk is focused."

They've got hundreds of gateways to circumvent the planet and our links are gonna be changing frequently. Some of them go out of service because The the satellites go out of range of 1 another. Inter satellite links have a finite distance. And, angles, occlusion by the sun lots of reasons that that just simply can't work anymore. And they get real assigned and re reconnected on a regular basis. So they're basically very flaky. This is for those of you who are old enough to know what a t one is, This is like operating a network with flaky T1s. We've seen this before. Also, we know that we have finite capacity and we have infinite demand So traffic Engineering is a necessity. I know cells are a very limited resource. Now the only solution we have to create real solution to scalability problem is to install hierarchy. And so what I'm proposing is that we do exactly that. Our link state IGPs, we already have 2 level hierarchy, And this is absolutely useful because it contains all of the link change churn. That the ISLs are gonna give us If you look at the way OSPF works, we've got an area 0 backbone, We've got areas tangent to the backbone. I think all of you know this. This is not a good fit because we don't have anything in the satellite network. That works as a backup. It just isn't there. ISIS is a little more general. It's a little more flexible because we can have level 2,"

Now this would normally cause a gigantic scalability problem because you'd have, L2 with all umteen thousand nodes in it. But hang on. I've got a hack for that A biggest problem we wanna think about is area partition. Most of you are probably familiar with this. If an area partitions in ISS things fall apart. There have been lots of folks who've worked on this over the years going way way back basic idea to solve this is to tunnel from one side of the partition to the other. And this has never been a very satisfactory solution. Our end solution has always been don't do this. Do not set up your topology so that you end up with partitioning. On terrestrial networks. This is a matter of paying more money for more cost. You have enough links This is difficult to do in a satellite network. So how can we achieve this? How do we get areas that are not going to partition? Basic idea here is what we're calling a Stripe. We're gonna take satellites in adjacent orbits, and we're gonna bond them together. And now my PowerPoint skills aren't good enough to really show what this looks like. Because the the actual orbit not actually parallel. They're offset and inclined one from one another. So it's there's a lot of skew that's gotta go in here. And those inner satellite links cannot, cover the cases where there's maximum skew between various different orbits. However,"
  },

    "startTime": "00:58:02",
    "text": "adjacent orbits can have multiple intersatellite links interconnecting them thing. And so the hack here is let's choose a stripe as the union of several orbits and enough orbits so that we do have continuous connectivity between all of these orbits. And the assumption is that there is a number that is large enough to do this. Without becoming too large for our protocol. Okay. Once you've got a stripe, then things are very, you see, simple. We're just gonna wrap the planet in stripes. K? If you do that, then the ISIS topology looks pretty simple. Okay. We're gonna use area proxy. This is a new extension to ISS. We're gonna have you represent each area As a single node at level 2. And there's a separate internet draft already out there for how this is it works we've got an implementation of this out there in the wild. -8-8-8-8-8- Does work. Gives us a drastic improvement to scalability k. Every area now is one node, and all of the noise inside of that area is just completely hidden from level 2. So for our satellite network, area proxy, looks like this. We've got a level 2 link state database. It's just the number of areas in the entire topology. So this is very small, Very stable, and almost immune from ISL failure. Not a lot of turn going on. Now we do wanna do traffic engineering. Because links aren't free. I don't think anybody in this room needs to be convinced to that. And for this particular application,"

Basically, what we're gonna do, we're gonna take and have the gateway perform all of its traffic engineering functionality. All the traffic in the region is going to be flowing through the gateway. Both uplinks and downlinked. So it has a full traffic matrix for everything that it needs to know going on. We're also gonna plug it in to to ISIS. It's got several choices here. It can run ISIS level 1 directly if it's got connectivity to the satellites. All the satellites in the stripe. Or it can get ISS over a tunnel a scrape that it's not connected to, or it couldn't get the topology via BGPLS. Again, for stripes that it's not connected to. Lots of ways of doing this, but basically the idea is we're gonna give the gateway full apology information for its stripes. And from the traffic demand and the topology, we can now do path computation. Very straightforward. We can optimize our capacity, we can avoid link congestion both on the uplink and on the downlink. And both are absolutely necessary. There's nothing new and fancy about this. We do all this path computation all the time in terrestrial networks. Yes, there, we typically use RSVP and do setup, but we're not gonna do that here. We're just gonna use and produce seed lists. Okay. I'm my clicker is no longer working. Okay. Thank you.

And this turns out to be very useful in this case. This is just a sieve that's assigned to the area And it's easy to compute because L2 is going to give you the area. So this absolutely trivial. So we can do traffic engineering and could do a fancy sid list, like what you see here, node sids, link sids. The whole nine yards. K? And if we're gonna then do on Stripe Forwarding, say we've got a packet at the gateway, and we're gonna put it send it through one stripe, to the user station. Then all we need is a single listed And that's gonna be the Sid, a node Sid for the satellite that directly over the user station. And then you have an IP packet And based on the destination address, the satellite can downlink to the right user station. K. Very simple case. One label. If we're gonna do off strike forwarding, We just need to add an area label. And then we have our satellites node Sid and we're done. Then. Question. I'm showing. Yeah.

You just mentioned the second bit of routing will be a good solution for the satellite, at work. I I totally agree. In the, you syncing the MPRSSR will be a good solution. But from my point of view, even NPRs, s r the overhead it's too high. For the sense that than work because, you know, the bad ways for the satellite is really expensive. So is that a possible you know, NPRs, we need, suited who pit for labor. Maybe we can short it, such as the 60 bit because The Stents Nighters number It's March. Less than the rotor in the earth, right, So sixteen bit maybe It's enough. So maybe something like, the CC solution for SF 6 will be more efficiency. Right?"

Robin, for Huawei, in fact, my question similar as we transfer the comments. So, because we know the S armed cars. So we're seeing that that you would label stack, you still have the matter overhead. Have you when you're thinking about this 1, how about this So you can reuse the existing, the MPR, so you can use them for traffic engineering because that's only the single label.

This is very nice because the gateway can do all this computation in the background, and you can stuff it full of CPUs and do as much of it in parallel as you want. And the result is that the label stack changes, but you only need to deal with that. When you actually have a packet for that destination. Can't k. That's relatively straightforward, and there's no signaling you have to do. The gateway just slaps a label stock on it, and it sends it Okay. So this is actually not bad. And as you could see in the very common case where you're doing off stripe forwarding, you're only adding 2 labels. 3. So you've got 64 bits of overhead. I'll take that. Kenji. Same thing to say here. I tried to, It's grabbed something, but the jumping of out the IGP or BGP box here, cuts for the little meal of the geosings. We have a a work called the ephemeris. So, basically, the tracking of object, orbit of satellite is a predictable So the thing is here, you know, There are some real requirements, from some other, organization talking about how to use this information that provided through ephemeris. That means you do not need to use the IGP BGP to run the food dynamics and to do the work. You have indication or enough information to do the work in advance.

Yes, the schedule will tell us when leaks should come up it's important to distinguish between that and they did come up k? lots of cases where links don't come up right when you want them to. There are gonna be And throwing traffic across a link that isn't quite there yet is a bad idea. Okay. Off strike return forwarding is pretty straightforward as well. You need an area label, and then a gateway, and you're done. K? So 64 bits to get out, 64 bits to get back. That's acceptable overhead in my book. You'll notice I haven't had said anything about IP addressing. That's because this is pretty much IP address independent. This the You the satellites do need to know the IP addresses of the user stations that they are talking to but those do not need to be aggregated in the satellite network in any way. They all come from a single prefix assigned to the gateway. And presumably, the gateway is going to advertise that out to the internet. This is very nice because it Finesse's rector's law. Addressing aligns with the apology. Very simple. So So this seems like a relatively easy and straightforward way to do routing for satellites. It's using existing off the shelf software and hardware.

This document extended the APM framework to incorporate the application side, the consideration, they still mean, so the APN resources in the APN domain are allocated to applications and the applications in, compose and then encapsulate the API attributes. Within the packet. So then the network device and directly take use of the information. In the original packet, for final granulated services. So from here, we can see this is the See, this is the extension of the s APN for any walk. This is the EPIN controller. So it will allocate the EPU resource to the application server. On demand. That means the server can apply for this, the EPU resource from this to the controller. So then after the resource has been allocated to the application server. So you can't Also, allocate the super saver This is the application, and we are information. To the application client So then This application aware information can be encapsulated though, by the APN capable this client and send it to the APN domain. So this network edge device car.

That means, has nothing with the applications. And for the application side, the extension It's under to under. That means from this, the application client to the APN domain. And then to the application server. And the then they see the allocation of the API ID So far, this is the APM phone work. This API ID is allocated by the controller to the network ID device.

But for this, the application side extension, call this information. Is sent end to end from the application clients signed to the agent domain and then to the server. So that is trying worse multiple domain. So that the user proposed a mall cycle ready under the power reserve's concern. So there's a usual master bid COVID waste carefully and the gym details. And then the last so these are the components for oh, sorry. I make a mistake. This is, in fact, for the APN framework. So this is only the controller APN edge and only this, the APN had the midpoint and the end point. So that means only devices in the European domain. But for the application extensions, that you So that's either 2 key components. One is the APN capable object in your server Another is the APN capable application client. So that means the application side are involved in the extension of the APM framework for the application side. Okay. So so here is Jocelyn quickly to go through this, the new components for this, the APN, there's a capable application server.

For example, this is the APN AC So that's, at the beginning, for the APM phone work, it will encapsulate the APN information for the packet but because in the APN for any welcome. For the application side. This information had been encapsulated by the applications So for the API address, the enhanced functionality.

In your framework, you claimed the attributes will be encapsulated to the user package, but, from my personal point of view, the application attributes is, could be could be managed to do and by the management and a control plane, So, if it's encapsulated in the user package, it will be there there will be some overhead problems Thank you.

And that is to upgrade gradients between accelerators before a next generation. So, and, and there will be multiple many iterations during the whole training. And now new mechanisms are proposed because this, distributing distribute, training has, great and, an influence on the network and the, new mechanisms to be proposed to serve AI training up locations to meet the network for the next. And so, but, look to looking to these mechanisms, we can see that there is a demanding or better collaboration between the network and the whole side and they can greatly improve the application efficiency And the other inside is less information for collaboration needs to be carried in package.

But we, believe we are, is prone to in induce some in cost congestions from the perspective of a server, And now with in network computing, it will offload the behavior of server to the switch. And the switch is capable of neither in processing of aggregation. And if we are going to eliminate the in cast congestion, so to enable irons the, you know, competing in the switches, the the host needs to expose the the intent of the application to be calculated and the the content should be calculated.

And the second use case is to find, to enable 5 grade packet scheduling for low balancing and in Center layer, they usually use peripheral SNP. And but in distribute large model distribution and learning synchronize large flows may be distributed to the same pass and and further incur congestions. So currently, usually adopt 5 grade per packet, ECMP. And but it will lead to packet disorder due to multi passing of the packet. And, we can find some experiments to show the impact of this order. So layout could be one solution to target is is to reorder the packets in the ingress switch or mix. Without modifying and affecting the end host transpose. So the packets will be a sprayed in the ingress, which can later reorder And so in this use case, the sequence of, packet need to be carried on different, hosts and through host, different hosts and network devices."
