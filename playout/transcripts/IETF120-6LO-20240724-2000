That was a requirement coming from the industry for in particular, measuring applications They wanted a simple multicast service just like they have a unique service. They'd want to use email that doesn't fit the IOT model for the device sleep, so we did this multicast registration And now we are extending this work even more for prefixes because more and more we are taking about giving away prefixes to devices There is one last which has been on the back burner for a while, which is the unique lookup. As soon as we have those database, Sutterize or distributed databases of addresses, in the subnet, it would be very cool to be able to look up that data as a Unicast as opposed to using broadcast for it distributed databases of addresses in the subnet, it would be very cool to be able to look up that database as a Unicast as opposed to using broadcast for and the address lookup Once we've done this prefix registration work, I hope we can move on to the Unicast lookup So yes, we've registered address We have registered Unicast, Multicast addresses. Let's be for prefixes, and why are we doing this? Well, first thing, some hosts will want prefixes and forms of hosts could be false be for prefixes. And why are we doing this? Well, first thing, some hosts will want prefixes. And forms of hosts could be phones, for instance. And if you own this prefix, this prefix attached to you, then there is no need for routing to get to the prefix if you tell your neighbors, hey, I have this prefix. They can just give the packets to you for whatever address in the prefix There is no really routing involved. And that's why neighbor discovery is a fine mechanism for providing first up communication to a prefix.

And so we would just register a slash 96 to the router and define an IPV4 prefix inside that and map that to Kubernetes And then, like I said, anything directly connected and there are some usages, for instance, in our network you connect a router that has a prefix to your home network and you would like the whole home network to be able to reach on the other side of that route You need to announce the prefix in the home network, but you don't necessarily want to support any particular routing protocol Then again, ND is a good agnostic method to just tell the other routers on the home network that this particular router has this preference So, how do we register? a prefix? Well, it's the same arrow option or ERO option as we have in 8505 And we're using for Unicast and multicast addresses The idea is once a node register, a prefix with router, if the network, the subnet is actually a larger subnet then the router can inject a prefix in the subnet gateway protocol. And that's what we are discussing at six men in the IPV6 of our way wireless draft There is an air flag, which was already defined in 8505 the other is yes I want the SGP to register my prefix or no, I don't want the SGP to read redistribute my prefix.

So there is this F flag that was discussed in the draft, which is kind of complex. It's about whether on which side the prefix is and well maybe we'll just abandon that idea. I didn't get much feedback on the but if people could read the draft and look at this like discussion probably would say okay it could be useful, but the picture becomes complex Example of use case then again that's a cloud like Kubernetes use case, but you could figure also on network where all this infrastructure is just, you know, your home You have this, this host on the bottom, which is effectively which effectively owns the subnet in case of Kubernetes you would have, you could have a full and PV4 PV4 host on the bottom, which is effectively, which are effectively owns a subnet in case of Kubernetes, you would have, you could have a full and PV4 real or a 10-darts private addressing. And you inject the slash 96 to say, hey, I own this prefix and in this case you see the router on the left injects it with the earth flag on meaning that is being redistributed but it also injects it to an alternate leaf saying, hey, don't inject that in the routing and get the traffic back through L1 But if anyone dies, then I will tell L2, and now you need to inject the prelix model L being the leaves into which devices are attached.

You can see my face in full. I'm sorry for that So yes, there is this important work at this Ops about the HCP prefix delegation per device. So the idea is, yes, no, you can get from the HCP, you can get to 644 for instance. Okay, or I would say maybe a lot larger, longer prefix, if you want to multiply prefix inside 1 slash 65. Anyway, so you're getting this prefix from the HCP prefix delegation Question is now, how does the router know that this prefix? has been allocated or delegated by the HCP? The way it's done today is like secret sauce between the DHCP and the routers, but there is no really official connection between them So if you wanted to take the DHCP server at the RRCP routers from different vendor, we have this hole on how to effectively tell the router that this device has the prefix. Now, with this draft, not only can we obtain a prefix from the HCP and now declare it to the routers we want to talk to, but at the same time, we can also prove the ownership using the rover option, which we already defined since 8505 and that has become trustable with 8928 So we have a way to get the prefix get associated to a public key somehow"

The same full document with all the notes. I have to apply those changes and publish again. The second point from Dave's review was this draft just discusses unique prefixes there is no way to register multicast prefixes. So I never thought that we could need that but since we are using the P field, and there was only the value 3, 012, 2, 3, 2 bits, only one value left that was designed to be used for prefix Now we are using it as design but there was never the idea that there would be a need for anything but unique as prefixes.

Well probably we can declare that. I mean, it's easy to recognize a multicast prefix from just the FFFF on the first byte. But well, the question is open. For now, I don't see a need for multi-cast prefixes, but maybe I'm missing something So please discuss that on the mailing list or come to the mic if you see that it's useful For Dan's review the silent point I would say was that he or come to the mic if you see that it's useful. For Dan's review, the silent point I would say was that you would like to lift up operational consideration sections. Section, we are I would say was that you would like to lift up operational consideration sections. We already have backward compatibility, but it is more about operations So we did that already for the Murtigast registration. So why not do it for the prefix registration? I see this number of things that we can do. So probably on the next revision, you will see an operational consideration section wrapping the backward compatibility one Then there was this question about, the title for the section that has all the math and should etc bcp 14 And the title is always the same in every document around write. It's called something like Requirements Language and then was surprised by this title, it's not mine I mean, Eric, if you're in the room, tell me if this title is right or wrong, but that's what I've been using everywhere.

I don't see which point of the charter it fits because it's clearly it's close to routing somehow, because you modify a role no no no no i won't take that it's not routing at all because there is no Up there is no route. There is no path computation there is no path but you update triple document Sorry.

I would like to give you my argument when you discuss with John My argument is a routing protocol computer path. Here we are talking to the routers which will do the routing protocol We are giving them the information that they will need to inject But there is no path computation there just look at the router preference in arrays It's not rotting.

So so maybe it's maybe we would just remove it but anyway yes it would be good at the next opportunity to go back to snack and present this draft again I would love to have discussions on this draft copied the snack mailing list as well So that's, yes, it's one of the big use cases So certainly that's a very good question"

OK Now, the skipping the first revision, I mean, the bit between revision 5 and 6, as a structure, there is, there are no changes at all At the beginning of the document, we inverted the definition of PASA host and PASA router, just because actually the process is there when our nodes come up first it takes the roles as a PAS host, looks around to connect to the router or the route and then if itself has to be a router, then switch the role. So make sense to have the route, the router, the route the host, the router, okay? And also since the the the address allocation function that we describe in this document is tree-based, we switch an acronym to TAF as the address allocation function Um, did some clarification about how it works in the case of the PLC, just to recall in the first part of the document we have an extensive section about use cases so we need to add some clarification in the specific PLC functioning and then we added some clarification text here and there, which was important and it was a good point about the usage of non-volatile memory because like in other documents, if by any chance, I know, restarts, so basically what it does, it changes in the non-volatile memory if he has"

So on your left-hand side, you have the previous picture. As a simple of the nodes, we were used capital letter O which was misleading like a zero which was part of the address. So now we use double parentheses which is reasonable I mean And that were the changes from 5 to 6. So this was the revision from Poland Now on the changes that we did following the Joel's review Again, no changes in the start changes that we did following the Joel's review, again, no changes in the structure whatsoever.

And the other point, is about whether or not this document should be standard track or experimental Now, there are arguments on both sides, I mean, that this document leverages a lot of mechanisms that are already started to track. At the end of the day, what it does is just a different encoding or the path to be followed in order to reach the destination. So it's not that different ripple in non-storing mode if I recall correctly. So basically, it's a different encoding It's also too that is an encoding that never has been used.

And what's happening really is the path is written into the address and that's where paza starts the routing has been done the routing is finished the trees is built PASA starts when after the routing has been done, you have to write the rots somewhere and Paza offers you a way to quote and quote save on the source route. I mean, that's the analogy with ripple non-starring mode is you write the path as a suite of addresses in the source route header you write them inside the address But think about it, the rotting header is not rotting Even it's called a rotting header, RH0 is not rotting.

So we don't use the target leak local address option, so which is used for the link local registration, right? Actually, things can go a little bit more so which is used for the link local registration right actually things can go a little bit further in the sense that in principle you can embed this option when you come up when there is the routing solicitation and routing that advertisement exchange, meaning that the node comes up what it does is to send around a routing solicitation He can put the option in order to ask directly for an address, okay? and if the router supports the option he can add the option back the option in the routing advertisement otherwise just ignore the option Nothing to do um yeah that's it.

    "text": "see on the right which is offering the alternative of using chic as a technique for head compression in the same environment This is because the expectation is that SHIC should provide a greater compression ratio and therefore better performance Next please So today I'm presenting version 06 There are several updates, most of them as a result of trying to align with the latest developments in the chic architecture draft So that's a chic working group document. The content that I'm presenting today is the result of a couple of presentations and discussion in two chic working group interims. And also there are some other updates of other types throughout the document next please so this is the changes in the table of contents that are basically two changes here both of them are really with aligning with the chic architecture draft. So first is section 3.2 on chic architecture concepts and then there's also in section 4 there's a subsection on the chic header next please so first of all for those of you who maybe are not following the discussion in the chic working group or did not attend the session on on monday just some background concepts and then later we'll see how we apply the in our draft. So first of all, in the chic architecture draft, there's the concept of chic stratum, which would be somewhat the layer, the location of at which chic operates and then in one such structure there is one chic heather which indicates the sheet packet instance to be used to decompress a chic packet so"

    "text": "there is one chic header instance And then on top, there can be like several possible instances of a chic packet for compression decompression. Okay. And then we have another parameter, which is external to the chic data units, which is a discriminator which indicates the she can have a instance that's needed to decompress a chic head another parameter which is external to the chic data units, which is a discriminator, which indicates the chic heather instance that's needed to decompress a chic heather. So the discriminator tells how to decompress the chic heather and the she heather tells how, which is the chic packet instance that you need to use to decompress a chic packet in the case when there are several possible chic packet instances okay so next piece so how do these concepts apply in our draft well we when there are several possible chic packet instances okay so next please so how do these concepts apply in our draft well we've added section 3-2 chic architecture concepts First, about the chic stratum In the draft, what we do is that she is used to compress IPV6 packets over 15.4 net networks. So in this case, the SHIC stratum is located on top of layer two and below layer three One aspect to consider here is that the compressed data of the chic stratum may also compress appellate packet headers. So there are different possibilities she may be used to compress IP headers or perhaps IPs like headers all at once or maybe IP UDP co-op all at once Then we understand that the discriminator in this case would be the first field in the 15.4 frame payload which is the six low pan dispatch. In this case, when set to the SHIC dispatch or SHIC pointer dispatch, it indicates that what comes next is a chic data unit. Next please Then we have also introduced a couple of concepts for the analysis of how we apply the chic architecture concepts one is the single instance network"

    "startTime": "00:50:00",
    "text": "and on the next slide we talk about multiple instances networks. So in the first one, single instance networks these are networks where all the nodes have a single sheet packet instance for compression decompression CD and therefore each node has a single set of rules for chic packet CD. In this case, then because the chic header indicates which is the chic packet instance you need to use, because there's only one here, one instance in single instance networks, then okay, the chic header can be fully compressed down to zero bits sent over the air and because it is possible to do it like this then in the draft we state that it must be fully compressed for single instance networks Then also all network nodes have a single chic header instance and a single set of rules for chic header CD which in this case is kind of empty equivalent to comprising a single implicit rule for chic header CD for all the notes Next please. So a about multiple instance networks, these are networks where at least some of the network nodes may have more than one chic packet instance for CD and therefore there will be one set of rules for each chic packet instance. So some of the nodes have several sets of rules and it is possible that there could be say Rule ID 2 in one instance rule ID 2 in another instance and they could be different rules Okay. So for this reason, we need a chic header, which in this case cannot generally be fully compressed because we need some something, in this case, the chic header, to tell when a pack, when a node receives a chic compress package okay, which is the instance that needs to be used for the decompression so it means that with one exception that I'll mention later in this case with multiple instances networks, we need"

Next please Okay, so you may recall that in this draft, one of the main problems is trying to enable multi-hop communication, how to deliver a packet which is compressed by using chic end-to-end in a 15.4 multi- topology. So, recall that for that we have three route over modes and we also have mesh under and now we need to consider both cases of single instance networks and multiple instance networks So you will see that uh well we'll go through one example for each one of these cases although some of the conclusions, as you will see, can be sort of generalized. So this is one example with a single instance network In this case, basically, this is in straightforward route over SRO, which means that the nodes like the 6LRs intermediate nodes in the network, need to store all the rules for CD for compression decompression which are being used in the network So imagine that host A transmits a packet to host b well then it will use Rule ID 1 to compress the packet. It will send the sheet compress packet to the next hop, which is the upstream 6LR and the upstream 6LR has single set of rules because there is a single instance networks, so it just uses Rule D1 to this one to decompress the packet and perform its routing decision and then compress the packet again and send it to the next home and so on until the packet reaches the destination so because"

    "startTime": "00:54:00",
    "text": "this is single instance networks, you have seen how things just operate correctly without ambivities The chic header is compressed down to zero bits And of course, for this to operate correctly, we need that a rule and its corresponding rule ID must be unique network-wide. However, the means to ensure this are out of scope of the draft Also, to simplify the management of rule ID, because this could be a challenge for bigger networks in SRO, all nodes in the network may share the same set of rules. Next, please please So what happens in still straightforward route? over, but now with multiple instance networks. So in this example, now there are two possible instances So the nodes have like two sets of rules And in this case, for example, let's say that host a receives the sheet compass packet with rule ID2 okay the question is as you can see with the red arrows, there are two possible rule ID2, one in instance one one in the instance I2 So okay, host, they may wonder which one is it? which set of rules do I need to use, which is the instance that i need to use so for this reason we need the not fully compressed chic header which will tell, okay, which is the instance you need to use right? Next please Then the second route of the technique is called tunnel based route over Here the assumption is that the network is running ripple. By the way, there's some of the term terminology about the hosts that still needs to be updated that was a comment by pascal and yeah this assumption is, Ripple is being used here as the routing protocol in non-storing mode and then as a way to avoid the 6LRs to have to store all the rules in the network, then what we have is tunnels"

    "startTime": "00:56:00",
    "text": "so if host A wants to transmit something then there's a tunnel from host A to the root of the network, which is the 6LBR in this case and then if the destination is internal to this net network, say host B, then there will be another tunnel downward tunnel from the route to host B. So in this case, basically, imagine that, again, hosting tunnel, downward tunnel from the route to host B. So in this case, basically, imagine that, again, Host A wants to transmit this packet from A to B Then it compresses the packet with Rule ID1 so the SHIC compresses packet is carried, encapsulate in the tunnel. The route will receive the internal packet and we'll see okay it's rule ID 1 but it is clear which rule it is, because there's a single instance networks here, and then it will decide, okay, my destination is host B and it will send the chic compass packet down to host B so again this is a single instance networks so the chic header can be an it is compressed down to zero bits, and also to avoid ambiguities at the 6LBR a rule and its rule ID must be unique network wide However, the means to ensure this are also out of scope although it's easier than of course in the straightforward route over. Next, please What happens in same approach, tunnel-based route over, but if there's multiple instances here okay again we need a not fully compressed chic heather Again, imagine that host A receives a chic compress packet with rule id2 okay is it the Rule 82 in instance one or the one in instance? two? Okay, the not fully compressed chic header will tell which one to use Next please the third and last roadover mode is point pointer-based route-over. Sometimes we call it pro In this case, recall that there is a pointer that is prepended to the chicken"

    "text": "Compress Packet, which will allow any node that receives the sheet compass packet with the pointer to find the location and the size of the residue of the destination IPAS destination address so that imagine that the 6 in the middle it doesn't store the rules but it can still determine it can reconstruct the original IPV6 destination address because it knows the prefix and then it can find the compression residue So in this case, a package is routed. The routing protocol doesn't have to be ripple, but it's routed from the source to the destination and the advantage is that again as in TRO, we don't need to store the rules in the intermediate 6LRs alarms. So, can you please go back? yeah thank you so here in single instance networks, again there is no ambiguity about which rules need to be used, because this is single instance. So the sheik header is compressed to zero bits, and then another point is that in contrast with the other techniques, a rule ID may be used to identify different rules used by different pairs of endpoints such as as highlight on the right of the slide you can see that nodes A and C use one rule which is identified by Rule ID2, and then nodes D and B have another rule It could be different, but has also the same identifier Rule ID2. There is no issue because this is single instance networks and there will be no ambiguity in this regard. Next please if it's multiple instance networks again, same reason as before we need a not fully compressed chic header so that a receiver can determine, OK, who"

    "text": "we need a not fully compressed chic header so that a receiver can determine, okay, which is the instance that needs to be used to decompress any incoming packet. Next please Okay, finally, we have mesh under. So first there's you can go one back Thank you So first, in single instance networks it's mostly the same as in pro Of course, here we have Mechander and the nodes in the middle are Mesh and the forwarders and so on. But the conclusions are all the same. The chic head is compressed to zero bits and also a rule ID may be used to identify different rules used by different pairs of endpoints Then in the next slide, in multiple instance networks, here there is some interesting exception because in this case, even if there's multiple instances, it is possible to fully compress the chic header, at least in some cases For example, you may see that again, we take the host A as a possible destination There is one rule ID2 in instance one and the sender there could be node C. And there's another rule ID 2 in instance 2 where the sender could be node D. So the host A may receive a ship compass packet with Rule ID 2 and it might wonder okay which one of the two instances do I need to use to pick the rule to decompress the packet? Well, in this case, because this is mesh under, it is possible to tell which is the instance because there's a different sender in each case and the mesh header includes which is the source of the packet so as long as it is possible to tell from the source which is the instance, then it is possible to fully compress the chic header here as well So next please. Okay"

    "text": "so then in order to introduce the chic header, we have updated the frame formats in the draft, so basically what's in red is new. The previous format is everything else. So this one that you can see on the slide is the one for straightforward rotover, also used in single hop transmission And basically, what you can see is, yeah the whole data unit is the 15.4 frame payload and there is the chic packet which is the packet that has been compressed by using chic and then it is preceded by the SHIC header, which again in single instance network it represents zero bits in compressed form and in uncompressed form it will be something like, well, in a compressed form, we still need to define it. But in compressed form it will be something like a rule ID and a compression residue So in multiple instance networks, where generally we cannot fully compress it, in that case, we recommend the rule ID size to be between one and eight bits. Next please Okay, these are the formats for tRO for downward transmission when the source is not the root when the source is the root or upward transmission again what's in red is the new part, which is the chic header which precedes the chic compress packet Next please Here we can see the updates for the form for Pro and Meshander For Mesh ander, it's also similar Actually, well, this is one of the options for Meshander, but anyway basically we have the sheet compress packet and the sheet header precedes the SHIC compress packet And the case which is slightly different is the one in pro. Because what you can see are top of the slide is basically the pro head so this is what precedes the chic compress packet"

    "text": "and because of that the natural location for the chic heather would be after the pro-heather and before the chic compress packet. However, there is one reason why we thought that it might be a good idea to insert the sheet header in the middle of the Prohead and before the sheet compress packet. However, there is one reason why we thought that it might be a good idea to insert the sheet header in the middle of the pro header. And the reason is that we wanted to keep the big pointer as simple as possible and keep it independent of the sheet header. That's because the bit pointer indicates after the address length how many bits you have to count until you find the compression residue for the whole limit and the IPV6 destination address. So by doing this approach, the bit pointer stays as it is and we do not complicate its operation Next please, yeah So there are also other updates in the draft so all the previous ones relate with a light with the chic architecture now there is a section in the draft about maybe this discovery. So one thing that we have a data is that compression of IPIC headers is now being developed in the SHIC working group Another point is that we got some early review. Yeah, go on maybe. I don't know if I move to the mic it's maybe better for the camera Okay So for the compression of ICMPV6, we say that we stay on RFC 44 43, if my memory is good. So it means that we don't cover neighbor discovery okay yeah so it means that there is some part of the ICMP messages which will be compressed but the rest is not So we don't, yes, in fact we have just here error messages and ping.

Yeah, thank you for that clarification so perhaps it might be interesting to consider even chic to compress the payload of those messages, but still this is intended to say that, okay, we have some way to improve a little bit the transmission of ICMP V6 messages carrying neighbour discovery messages by using SHIC okay well let's see if we develop a bit more or not And okay, then the other point is about Ianna consider We got an early IANA review and basically the content of the considerations was already okay, but the format they requested us to to put the content in this table that you can see on the slide so yeah we basically modified the content and put it in the format of this table so yeah just recall that this is the request of fields big patterns for the six loop and dispatch type one for chic in page zero, in page one, and also for the sheet pointer in page zero. Next please yeah so we also have one addition in the security considerations this was a comment by Pascal that yeah now in pro we have the pointer so that creates new attack opportunities, right? So malicious note might modify the related fields and that would be with the aim to avoid the packet reaching its intended destination producing some error there so we understand that the appropriate use of link layer security might"
