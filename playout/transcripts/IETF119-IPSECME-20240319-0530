And as a result, it's really actually hard to detect and recover, and Lawrence as an implementer might probably tell you more about that.

So what's the draft proposes? Very simple. The proposed solution is to reserve to SPIs, 78, which will indicate echo request and a correspondence in ESP. So the IPC, peer can just Send, Mike.

You don't care, just that they're completely independent of each other. Yep. Yeah. I I I and uh-uh one another reason why we want you to use this not only because of the, sharing the same IP address space, but also you know, so many increase the operation and the maintenance complex for the operators.

So, it can be discuss the weather, there's a need to notify the peer that I can do yes and without reply deduction. Yep. Yep. Next slide, please.

And this draft can fulfill this requirement the other point is that, unbinding ESM from enterprise on whether should be, supported or covered in this draft or done in a separate job to order. Not do that. Yeah. Yep. Yep. That's all. Valerie card. Well, I think that the problem is more generic. And, the problem is that extended sequence number, use of extended sequence number is negotiated. So either both be a usage or both be a doesn't use it while, it should be a local matter.

It's because architecture does draft to a crypto architecture of published their watch later or not, but published by finalize much later, and during the process, we actually realized that there is no point of, you know, negotiating this, and that's why architectural craft says that or or she says that don't negotiate it. You just always send an c question number because sequence number is actually needed for ESN anyway, because the sequence the higher or a bit of the sequence number are included in the it. So you you have to keep track of the, how often it wraps anyway, regardless if you are doing a auto replay or not, so so you you are not going to get rid of the see, you know, monitoring the sequence numbers even if you able to add replay because for ESN requires that. So if you are not doing ESN, then you can actually asked to help ignore compared to the sequence number, but, otherwise, say, so but that that's the real history of why why it says this way. Paul. But so today is So the problem right now is that when when when people think like, oh, why why is my performance not happening? Let me just disable replay window action and they're shooting themselves in foot because now they're disabling ESN. Right. And that is fairly implicit. It's not very clear. So having these two things, completely separated. The code is usually the same. So for instance, Antero's famous words. The Linux journalist doing it wrong.

It just sent back Is there, a a fragment it sends back, lmap notify payload with the the version and the fragment land. And, And if it if it really can't, process the packet, if the packet is too big, Then it sent, a packet too big, notification payload in Ike. Next slide. So this is what happens. So as I mentioned, the packet to be the main advantage of the PT be messaged. She's ready to carry the LMTU and the e m m e m m t u r. So that the the other gateway is aware of those values. And, we prefer one suggestion was to use a configuration But, we we do prefer to have that to be dynamically configured. And be able to change. So that's why we keep that message. And that way to proceed. Next slide. So at the end, when when you received a fragment, you you make sure that, the peers in your network adapt the the terminal MTU so that No fragmentation is happening in the middle. Next slide. So it means either you have a source fragmentation or inner fragmentation being performed"

So this is what we wanted to achieve. So next slide. So, basically, we we we really consider very carefully all the the comments previously used. And, we really took those into consideration and clearly said what we do. So we're we're pretty responded to every comments. So PTB As I mentioned, is, is already mentioned into, one draft. From a from a to attach And the the main advantage of that message is to carry the EMTUR, as I mentioned. We still have one disagreement. With, to attach And it's, regard regarding how we configure the internal MTU. So In in this view, I mean, the the the, the the the the tunnel and the link The the tunnel and the leak, layers are independent, and fragmentation is ensuring that, independence. While, in our case, we are Making DMTU for for the tenants so that there is no fragmentation So we do not have, the link And the the tunnel being as independent as in the interior tunnel's draft. But, this is something that is currently done."

Then the next presentation is, It's, It's, the DSCP notification payload So what we so the initial idea we had is to be able to split, to establish some security association, that are based on the GSCP. So when we do have, traffic with different, quality of service, we can split them into a different security association. So that we can, avoid reordering and, some packets to be, rejected because of the interior play. Protections, the next slide, 1. So in the first version of that draft, we came with, traffic selectors. So we were defining DSCPS to fix selectors, but, this has been changed. And currently, The idea is that we are only using, a notify payload. And and Not negotiating so much, but, simply advert advertising, notifying the other what we're doing. So for each essay, we're, mentioning if we're associating to that. Do you see some specific DSA values. So, yeah, next slide. I think it's gonna be easier to see that."

In the second line, you can see that we have a notify payload that mentioned that the SAP values AF 11, and I have 3 are, carried from the initiator to the responder. And Potentially, the responder could respond with a notify payload just to come firm. He he understands what we are doing and, in in many cases, we expect that the the response is going to be the same. But as you can see, we do really support. It's not mandatory that, a response being sent And, And the initiator should support, should mean, it should work, as well. Without any response because it's it's simply a notification. That's what's, what needs to be remind. So next slide, Yeah. So that's basically all. again, the I mean, So, we I think there there is a kind of consensus for that, way to do and, we with with I don't remember any comment that has not that has not been addressed, and is draft again. Alright. We have 3 minutes, so I don't we have too many a time circle too many too much times here today, you know, comments on here. We probably want to have more comments But he's trying to adopt these are actually waiting for AD or, actually, I have to talk with AD to think about this. If these are these are"

So we have to think about that that talk with the ADs person and see if you need to re charter for this or or can be included directly. I'll I'll talk to Deb in the handoff. Good. To work this out. Yeah. Because I think these are equivalent extensions I'm not sure if there are minor extensions. That's actually the reason why I'm thinking about, you know, this. And Yeah. Some of them are some some of the talk to that, but I think I have the word to work. I want to get, you know, 80 comments on that. Okay. Go ahead. Okay. So, I think that's enough for that. Do you have some, do you, or do you have a question for this or for that? Okay. Stupid question. What is the, What is receive when when receiver gets to just notify about what DHCP blah, values, What's it to do with it? So, It's, I mean, it doesn't have to do anything. So it works it's also works. If he doesn't, if he does not support the extension, it's it's mostly if he is also doing some, traffic selections, In that case, it's good. It's good. You know, what the other peers is doing so that he can handle that. And we expect to, have some sort of, segregation of the traffic. So I'm sorry.

And it's it's just for for, you know, for their internal use the same SAP pursuit for the same traffic. It's not necessary, you know, the other one can do whatever they like, but you know, sometimes it's a good thing, very special for statistics and that kind of thing. If you can say that this essay pays for this kind of traffic and telling that what you are doing in the essays is is allowing that. I understand correctly is that is Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Alright. Okay. So then we're out of time. So that's it. And we will see next time in Mankover, I think. Hi."
