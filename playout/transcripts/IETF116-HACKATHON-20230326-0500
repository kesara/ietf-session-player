Now S l v six is we see it does not adequately realize the requirements of section eight being the security section of rf Fc four zero two, which is the S six architecture document. As such, Six has demons security flaws. And so we decided to come together and find watch and zeros as you were draft getting feedback from people in the room while we sitting here that we can refine it and bring people a document into the working groups later that makes sense to everybody. And we wanted to write something that addresses the issues but maintains all the current work. What we got done, we are very close. And we hoping to submit this next week. We can solid feedback very useful to do this type of work in the Hack There's a Url for the draft there. And we said the primary conclusion is we need to give obviously six in new Top. And we intend to complement the existing work rather than replace it. We learned, we confirmed the best strong interest from the operator community there were long discussions about where we were imposing the new Easter part. We are hoping that the benefits of what we've got will encourage people to adopt it and we found that obviously drafting collaboratively in the context that they have the fun which is not a normal way to create a trough that's actually really, really useful because of the mounted of feedback that we got.

To test interoperability between the different algorithm implementations also the gain experience with using these new algorithms and also to provide feedback to the standards. So you can see there's a number of drafts there and this are probably even more of that we make you so. Because next five zero nine as you know it's quite a big area. Okay. And so what got done?

And in this hack on, and since one fifteen, we've done a lot of work in test... We have our compatibility matrix on the different applications and how they work together. And we're working to expand to that to be more granular. We've also added C p structure so that something new expanding to some protocols. There's also... We do... There's a little bit of work with Cms message started starting Cms for using crypto messages and syntax, but we need actually more people to to do some more interoperability, especially with Chem because that's a new area. We also have looked at the hybrid certificate catalyst certificates that's essentially putting v material and extensions and certificates. Also, we've looked at the composite certificates that's another way of doing combining key materials And also, yeah, we also had some fun with an experimental Sai Extension.

You can study this you know, piece quiet later if you're interested. So in addition to networking, Bp f can also be used for scheduling. And this is a very recent addition to.

So it allows more flexibility and it allows more simple architecture. And also, we provide this information on our user friendly sites. And what we learned so far is basically our young later models. For the customer facing is able to provide necessary high level information. And this can be translated well enough to low level policy. And also the registration interface, the new the latest one simplify architecture and it allows the registration and query both with these new young data models. So the next step is we kinda want to implement life cycle of for dynamic policy updates. Where they basically, there's a fabrication of security policy. And we can also try to analyze our network behavior so that we can some sort automate our network security. And we have the open source project github."

I think one fifteen was our first official meeting. So we don't have any like long standing drafts or I've to hack on but we did recently adopt a couple of really important documents into the group. And in particular our architecture doc. So couple of plans hacked on one was to just sit together and heck out a whole bunch of important stuff. And alongside that, we had a coding plan to actually test it out and make sure we're starting off right. There's a lot of complex. Stuff going on in Git. And so the best way to check that we're actually doing things correctly and and sustainably is to actually try and trash it out."

Space here to pick up the really tricky issues and get through quite a lot all at once. And some of the complex areas are getting clearer. I can't say all of them. But the organization of the work groups and you know where things go, some of the stuff about registration policies and how transparent mutual load are is a is a really interesting question that's coming out. And also the sort of what goes where in the structures and the sort of syntax and fine detail. In the code, we got... I'm gonna say two and a half implementations of the current say of the architecture, which is pretty thin as we said, but what's done. We've got two and a half implementations down there. To test the practicality of of of what we've written so far. And that is up to interoperability at the interface layer so we're not going for of deep semantic interoperability of stored data, but everything up to that point we're really keen to to make sure that that that works well. And so what we had was in the middle, we got github with an open source kind of client emulator with a reference implementation Ari from from trans has has written one implementation. And we Arch of written an implementation too on top of our existing platform. And got to. Position where we can register claims and write them into feeds. Get receipts to verify those receipts. All consistent with this reference client. So What that means is we've got we've broadly demonstrated the inter drop claims of the practicality of what we've written. We've shown our choices of things like Cozy and Sea. Are pretty decent and it works with one observation that it's great. In inside implementations passing across application boundaries is a bit interesting with with C. And we've got the"

There was a presentation on early on Ip for what itself we got the some it Some advancements yep. and we also talked about the a scenario where to use Pd not only about network measurements or serving measurements, but also in our scenarios particularly on the context of one thing that that particularly important to me. That is the energy grade. Ap, so we're trying to apply to all scenarios that rather than just booking our servers. So we think that also the digital communication between the twins a real one and the digital can benefit from Pd two. And if you have more scenarios and more ideas Please come to talk with us.

And the was myself, David Elk and on my, and we worked primarily on on error management for the for the quantum internet. Demography is a form of lean or system characterization that you might do during bootstrapping or is it background task for continual system monitoring? But the problem with it is that the constant factor are very large could be many hours worth of data in order to characterize a link. So we are looking at combining that with an online form of error detection that's actually used during operations of actual links for generating quantum entanglement for sharing for applications And that technique known purification. We're looking at combining the two of those. And we think we actually made some progress on that today. Mostly David and and not working together on that. We also are working on some network specifications, which you've saw in the the I etf attendees list. We are actually writing shared specifications for a test bed here in Japan, but it may be years and years before we actually submit something to Atf on this. But in the process of working on this, Carson helped me solve some problems we were having with the graham dev tools. So that was the trip from my house an hour here or an hour from here all by itself. And we are working on some documents for defining network type nodes and definitions."

So we're working on the Json format for Econ it's conversation standard, If you haven't heard of it, we're we're still pretty new as well. It's a way of describing a human conversation in a way in which will protect the personal data which it contains and so that you can interchange between systems on the Internet. So if you have more questions about the econ, we have a ba session happening on Wednesday and this conference from to the table. So our our job here today with Hack was to use the econ to provide some kinds of examples of of ways of managing the personal information in it. So what we did here is we use one of our frameworks called the server to create a econ out of a wav file to translate it to transcribe it into a into readable format."

So so exactly what we work done was first the server change, which is a plug which takes prospect processes of econ. Chain has meant to allow vendors to easily use our tech technology to keep their customers data safe. The three links that we we worked on were the transcription link, we use an open Ai whisper. Thing for that, and we learned it was very slow. Then we used a another way of of managing the conversation. We use a summer sum. Link that used chat Gp to summarize it. Which was which was very simple to do. And part of the point behind pecans is to track the automations in Ai that touches the car conversation. So you validated that we... The the standard does port that, and we've got that down in our open source repo. And finally, an nomination which is to take the conversations that it sees and to make it completely anonymous to the next person down the chain. And we... I'll also use Open Ai for that and and that did work really well. And this was a good example of what's called prompt engineering, if new into this world. It's a it's a way of using what you ask the Ai to do for you. So in our on in our normalization, a non randomization. We asked it please analyze this conversation using friendly people as if they're from Boston. And because Dan and I are from Boston, and all I can say it was Wicked cool. So we also did a little bit of polishing on the framework. And we all submitted all this stuff into our github repo. As an open source project. So any more information you need, you can get it up there. Please visit us at our table. And we have a happening Wednesday at nine thirty. We'd love to see you there if you're interested in customer data privacy and automations in Ai,"
