Well, you know, the problem is I'm on I'm on the x that is where the camera points, right? So with them, man. So it's, 5:30 A EST by my clock, so I think we can get started. So welcome everyone to the first of 2 sessions for Mimi at this ATF meeting. Yeah. So Like, who we're saying, we have, I think, a lot to discuss about discovery. So I wanna get through the, care stuff, pretty quickly. Alright. So please, everybody, take note of the ITF's, intellectual property and code of conduct policies, note well, the note wells we like to say. Can we please get a somebody to volunteer to take notes during this session? Our everyone that we cannot proceed without a note taker Okay. Thank you, Nobody? Okay. Since, fortunately, since John is going to be leading the actual discussion, I think should be able to take notes Oh, someone took it. it. Someone took Did they? I didn't hear them. Yes. Sorry. Whereas Okay. Thank you very much, Brandon. Appreciate Okay. Let's move on to bashing on the agenda. So Today, it's, all discovery all the time. John is going to be leading us, through that.

Please spell that out by end of your day Friday so that we can, schedule that interim session, swiftly as possible. And if you're interested in having any other interns scheduled in the coming weeks months, say for the protocol transport stuff, please reach out to the chairs and we can go in that done for you. Sorry, Tim. On Just that. What was it? Go ahead. I think the I think the choices in the doodle might need to get updated So people should should pause on filling out the doodle. Until we get that sorted out. I'll send another email to the list once it's sorted out. Yeah. We can we can barely hear you, Alyssa. But I think we got it. I'm not gonna talk. It's 3:30 in the morning. So I don't mind shouting. So everybody just watch out for more communications from the chairs. Scheduling this next interim. Okay. Yeah. Let's move on to John. I'm gonna share your deck. Is that okay? I wanna share the deck. Might be helpful. It did to Sure. Okay. So this is a deck of slides that is not very long we are not going to get through today. And that we will be continuing in the interim, that Tim was just alluding to. Why don't we go to the next slide and get started So, this actually reflects the mail that Richard Barnes sent back in October that was describing some of the consensus points that he had identified, although I have"

And I think, unfortunately, the answer is We're not that far. There's still some disputation about how necessary this discovery function is, or even fundamentally what it is. But let's just say that we assume from the start that there are multiple Messaging providers who hope to interoperate these messaging providers want to be able to assert mappings to service independent identifiers, SII's, that have registered at their platforms. And this is like, I have a telephone number And like I am, for example, wire, and I want to be able to register this telephone number, I have a user you can route messages to at my service, right? We know that message senders want to discover which SII's map to which message service providers. And that broadly is what we think the discovery problem is. We're gonna delve down deeper into each of these and into a ton of questions and various, like, adembrations of these issues we go on through the stack, But very importantly, and this is the 4th bullet here, the overall egroup system, does not generally trust MSPs, not to assert false sii to SSI mappings. And what this leads to is this formulation, which I believe is Richard's that appears very bottom of this. That when we think about the discovery problem, it is thus twofold. In the first place, there is authentication. There is a need to generate mappings that, you know, MSPs can actually rely on as relying parties to authenticate these SII to SSI mappings, And then there is a separate distribution problem for those authenticated mappings. And when we talk about there being some kind of a service and oracle that you query, order to resolve these mappings, think about that. Like, these are separate real problems. There is some logical function in the architecture"

It is merely relaying you know, material from some trusted entity that did the authentication and getting down and to to the users and or service provider platforms that want to rely on these map things. Everybody here agrees with that, right, who is has their eyes open is paying attention. Is there anybody here coup, does not think the consensus points we had from October or, are pretty solid. Oh, I see people getting up. As I said, we're not gonna get through, like, 4 of these slots. Rowan, please. This is Rowan, and I actually don't wanna disagree with the contents of this slide. I just wanna make to say when we say the discovery problem, this is short for saying the provider discovery problem. Because inside of an of a single provider, we can solve that problem without some with some, some set of these things. Okay. Agreed. No. Hi. So you've been talking to the foreign exchange. I I'm not sure that we agree that, there's independent identifiers need to be registered on the platform or rider. I mean, there might be discovery mechanisms that done by third parties or others. As well. So, I mean, that that's the only concern I have on the flight Very good. I I I think, you know, again, the the spirit or the intended spirit of that is merely the message serving platforms want to be able to advertise. That they are routes to this. May in fact be a third party who's going to prove out those routes, right, and the discovery service indeed may be getting this information and we're gonna get into this, unfortunately, in scathing detail. His lights that follow. But, yeah, so I, I, I, I think your core point stands. So Anybody else? We got Okay. Next slide. Alright. So here we get into 1st principles. And here we can talk a little bit about the nature"

I hereby move, we find better terms for these that are easier to not mistake anybody here disagree with that? That SII and SSI, we should change those for terms that are not disclosed. Good. Okay. We're gonna do that in the next version of this requirements document. I promise. So the query key, chart is an SII. Imagine this Oracle exists and exactly what its nature is. We're gonna get into it again in in a few more slides and skating detail. But this is an important decision. Here. Between a and b. The response you get when you give a discovery provider. And SII. Could be either just reachability information. For a message service platform, that you can then deliver messages to or it could be 1 or more s s i's. That is URLs that actually are globally routable, and anybody you had them would be able to send messages to that. What is the distinction between those things? And I think this comes down a lot to do we imagine the kinds of mappings that might be aggregated in stored at these discovery providers, are going to be, you know, contain s SI's themselves, which are potentially kind of internalish identifiers or how messaged messaging services route things, Or do we think what you're gonna get instead is send this to this message service provider through an interface that is specified by discovery and, you know, just send the message to the s II, at that messaging service provider. And that as I point out, you know, there's a sense in which quickly the distinction between SSIs and SII becomes inexact. Right, in the sense of if SII app domain isn't SSI. Then you can more or less, like, manufacture those and some of the Rowan's points, I think, case, you don't you wouldn't need discovery. Right?"

But I see you people at the mic, so Richard, please. Yes. Uh-uh. I think I agree with that. Last statement that maybe it was like something missing on the last slide, which we you know, I think there's a presumption here that, like, if you've got an SSI. Then you know what service to talk to. And the protocol can flow. Protocol. I mean, like, basically, in other words, the the Mimi protocol should start from SSIs and, you know, able to initiate stuff from that so the the question, the discovery question, such as it were, is how you get from an SII to an But what if instead of a URL. Right? Let's let's imagine that they're, for the sake of argument, 8361 I am colon. You know, this this user at, like, this, this host, right? And that's what an SSI looks like. You know, I think the point is an alternative architecture to that. Is one in which, you know, you just get okay, I learned that signal is a route. To this SII. And signal either has a well known, like, public place that you can send messages to if you want to interoperate through them, to which you just send the SII? I think, I think this is a distinction with other point. Like, being able to send SII that's my 2 signal is the same as like I amcolonsii@sign provided, again, so exactly what the protocols are that that identifies be that assumes if you use 80, 8361, and this is why 61 is a good example, it assumes that you then look at like SRV records. And as SRV records, let's protocols, you could use to contact them. At that. You know, over various interfaces and like gets that property So I could imagine a way of doing discovery where what results from it is more like"

    "text": "Yeah. Signals got it. And if you wanted to send message to the signal, send them to, you know, via SMTP right, or at the following address without it being like a URL that you're giving up I mean, Yes. In principle, one could have, like, the multiplicity of protocols, but we're here in this group talk about one protocol. I I well, again, I I think the issue is, you know, if we view Mimi's scope as being largely MS to MSP communication and leaving the client to the degree possible, out of it, Right? Which I I think it is the intended scope as I understand or if I'm wrong, let me let me I agree with that. Yeah. Like, you know, if these s s i's actually have, like, kind of client specific dimensions to them. Then the question of whether it is Mimi's job to expose those SSIs, And, you know, our with those SSIs, for example, we're gonna talk about privacy and things like that in a minute. Would they become more sensitive? Right, if that is what the discovery provider is returning versus or, you know, does the signal not want people to know? SSIs behind these users. All they want users to know potentially is just talk to signal And, like, anything is more specific than that, like, might might be a problem. I think this is still an open issue. So who's next in queue after Richard? Ecker. Ecker, please solve this for us. Well, that's that's asking a lot. So, I mean, I mean, so might maybe helpful to take a step back from this question, ask for the mechanics of the thing are in general. Right? So I wish to you know, have I have the e one 64 number for you and you are associated with, as you say, you know, signal. I mean, what's whatever. Right? And in order to communicate with you successfully, I need to know first, I need I need a assertion that is validated. I need to know that you have an account with what that"

And then, and then I will need eventually you know, and I did an SSI of some kind. And I will find the and finally, I only cryptographic key material, that is sufficient to actually decipher to you. And, and and that I will need all those things before I form the first message now I think most likely that last piece will be attained from the service provider for for the for the terminal MSP because of because of the design of of MLS, that has to be refreshed quite frequently. Right? So you probably not wanna store, like, you know, your your, your caught your key material on the DP. And So, and and and because and it's similar because the because the design of, the requirement to be authenticated, we we need to have, like, verifiable version, at least of the, at least it is on, it is on a certain provider is independently verifiable. I think we're in for a sec. Yeah. We're gonna have another slide if we get to it, that is about this part entirely. I'm actually just trying to say, do we under and the distinction. Between SII's and SSI is well enough. To say what it is that we expect this career service to return. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, so so I guess I guess what I was getting at was somewhere in the middle of those 2 is where is is where the as it was the it was at the hospital return. I think you suggested the 22 alternatives. 1 is it just says a signal and there's or or or what's happened? The other is it says, you know, it's the thing. What's that? I guess I'm not sure Like, entirely why that matters. Because at the end of the day, we need to contact this service provider anyway in order to be able to communicate with that person and so what whatever I hand them is not they're actually a handle couldn't be why with especially with the handle also"

    "startTime": "00:16:00",
    "text": "Okay. So so what I would hear from that is But what what I take away from that is we may need both a and b. Be potential things that could be returned by discovery? That's potentially true, but I actually, what I meant to say was, I think we could hold that question in advance for some time. Okay. Okay. Enjoy We're not gonna get that one solved here, I guess. Yeah. No. So I I just wanted to note that mean, I'm bad, sort of concerned that we seem to be starting to define the requirements already by distribution or by an architecture. Maybe we should start by the user journey. So I understand exactly what what do we want this, I mean, what we want the user to do with these identifiers because then you find the architecture in in in terms of what's needed to support it. I mean, example, there might actually not be a discovery provider. It might be I mean, I'm thinking of the the at I might laugh. We had basically the DNS as a sort of distributed global discovery provider. Is collected with Rand. So I in general, maybe we should start thinking about which kind of identifier? I mean, what character 6, do we need this identity independent identifiers to have them to be useful. And then when when when you understand them, you can design the system and the architecture. So Sure. I mean, again, I I still I guess I believe that the getting the distinction between SAI and SSI nailed down well enough that we can use fully apply it to that. It's actually prior to that, but I don't disagree with you. I mean, if, again, there's a service that I often discuss in these things that is, GSMA Pathfinder. Service. Uses, 8361 identifiers and to do telephone number 2 Message destination resolution. Right? And it just supplies URLs. It just applies SSIs is what the output of GSMY Path Finder is. And they are indeed gotten through. It's a private DNS. You can only access it, but you're on the GSMA IPX or whatever, right? But It's just Enum. That does that. So, I mean, in, you know, we could make a choice scope decision, and say, b."

Do we need to have a version of this that is side that potentially Again, again, again, again, is exposing something about that, terminating providers' network. Right, that, the terminating message providers network might not necessarily wanna expose. I mean, it it seems to me like what the Request your needs to come out of this with. Is 2 things. It needs a notion of which SP to talk to. And what's bits to hand that SP to reference the user they're talking about, Yep. Right? If you encode those two things together and one thing that's be Yep. encode them separately? Can you And, you know, maybe that second thing is an SII. That looks like, hey. But, like, those two things are the things that we that need to fall So, I mean, that that that is increasingly making me think we need both. Potentially as targets of what is returned by discovery. I mean, Like, well, you work with those you need both of those data. Yeah. Don't I don't know that you need to, like, be able to encode them in both ways. I mean, it sort of depends on what the protocol looks like. It does indeed. Right. Like, the the protocol is a place you can, you know, shove an SII. But my, I guess, is the protocol's gonna look like there's some you know, identify our format, for a user that you wanna take an action on. Mhmm. Well, speaking as someone who works a lot on the protocol drafts for this, how does this look at the moment Yeah. So if you look at the the the draft protocol draft, like, there's we're we're explicitly very notional about identifiers and, like, you know, there's a syntax in there, but, like, it could change, like, there's identifier formats for, like, providers, users, clients, I think for the Okay. So maybe what we should do is replace this entire SSI abstraction."

Like, if we if we get a protocol document adopted, that tells that gives us a more concrete target for what this thing is supposed to do. Okay. That seemed I mean, you know, again, we we we don't wanna put the requirements entirely cart in front of the horse on this. But, like, I think that's a probably a reasonable path, actually. I, Yeah. But just to to rewind a little bit, like, the user identifier format, it's like, something at provider. Yep. So, like, you know, whether you wanna split it up as ARB, like, it's it's pretty much, you know, if you view that user identifier thing as the SSI format, it's pretty much be. Mhmm. Because that's the thing you will shove into the provider interface. To reference that user. Okay. No. That that that's actually helpful. And I'd be interested in people in the room who have an objection to that because that actually sounds like a pretty reasonable direction. Jim, so you think we shouldn't mess with e 164 at all. Understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a definitely all to, like, all together. I'm kinda confused a little bit here, John, because I can see why we're making a vaccine, making a distinction with reach and ability information, and you arise, but why couldn't those protocol interfaces just be URI so we simplify the whole problem space? I I don't see why we should make it over complicated by adding these 2 separate categories. I don't understand why that should be a necessity necessity. Shiller should try to simplify and rationalize things rather than try to make things more baroque than it really needs to be. So I I've heard some people float requirements of the form that the output of discovery should merely be the message service provider. It's And just the knowledge that this you know, yeah. Okay. For this SII, signal is a potential place that could be sent. And to have and and to have this stop at that very intentionally.

Mean, we arguably, key discovery is not additional. And that's probably the last thing that I wanna get to on this slide this this is something I think I've heard a bunch of divergent views about in this. Should the results of discovery process and when you get back from the dev discovery provider, actually provide you king information you need to form a secure security association. With the user that you're trying to reach. How do people feel about that? Is that something that we think is in scope of this? Is it potentially perilous, to do this?

And Peter Resnick in the chat points out that you probably mean 3861. Address resolution for Instinet You're right. Sorry. Is that correct? Yeah. don't I actually remember what it is. Thank you. The other thing is, Brendan, we're very grateful to you for taking notes, but it'd be extremely helpful you could join the meeting via meet echo so you show up officially in the participants list. Picks, That's all. Go ahead, Ron. But Yeah. So an answer to John's question my intuition is that I would like the I would like the amount of information that provider discovery provides to be as minimal as possible and leave the leave the rest of the business logic to the you know, individual providers Does anyone feel differently? Be very interested here other views about this. And and, of course, there are other ways once you've done discovery to be able to then get keys associated with it. So I don't know if if, was gonna get in line here, but, he put in the chat as mine biased think that it's better to return key material during discovery. It is better, too, better, Okay? Yeah. I would be interested to know why DKG thinks that It seems to me like the the security property you want out of discovery is the the discovery is properly done. Right. That the SAR is really balance this SSI. Within the rest of the protocol, we can talk about the SSIs and the established security associations between SSI and other SSI or rooms or whatever.

Because the there's, like, wildly divergent lifetime properties to those 2 things. Right? Like, SIISSI Mappings are very stable. Like the persist for a long time and, like, key stuff. Is is largely, like, ideally one time use in many cases. And so It's like even from an engineering point of view, it's a point there are different things to handle. I'm kind of vamping here to see if DKG comes to the Michael Echerkin. Yeah. Don't sit down. Maybe we should probably meet the key discovery because there are 2 kinds of here. One is the signing keys would you use for asserting your identity? And the other is the, and the other the other is the, is the the the encryption keys which you use to establish king channels. The signing keys, I assume, were relatively long. The encryption keys, are are potentially shorter. You know, it seems really well to me likely that the thing credential which you used to establish the the, the SII is associated with a specific, MSP also, establishes the signing key. And so it's it's a practical matter. It seems like you're at corporation Yeah. And I'm super interested actually, and we do have we won't get to this slide, I'm sure. You know, a slide about relationship is between me and the identity and the discovery.

The way this worked was that you've got a credential and the name of your SII and then you effectively use that to endorse the binding, you know, and so in that case, an obviously SD part of the discovery process. I can imagine other designs, of course, ummed but, you know, you you do have to have an individualized credential for the given FII in, you know, well, maybe you don't, but I think the argument would be the individualized credential for giving us I part of the discovery process. Otherwise, how do you, like, how do you trust the binding? Well No. I'm gonna relay for DKG here. He says in the chat.

So, you know, in your previous slide, you're talking about authorities who are trusted to authenticate the things. Right? There's there's signed things here saying that this mapping is valid. Yet.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think we've gotten through Some of this I, and I guess what I'm gonna take away from it, and this is the tough thing to minute, right, where where we are on this.

And that we're not We're not I wouldn't say we're a 100% confident that there is not some a case that is not going to devolve to a B case, but that, you know, we wanna focus on the b case rather than the a case. Even with this caveat that sometimes the distinction is very inexact, and that there are indeed use cases for potentially additional data that will be stored in the DP. That could be these signing keys, keys, and that we're We at least want to explore that a bit more as we look at what the interactions are between mimi identity, and, what the discovery stuff is. Anything else on this slide that people would like to litigate or re litigate? Before we attempt to move on to another slide with our amazing 25 minutes. Okay. Next slide. So exciting.

I mean, I I might have thought that this is something we already had some consensus about when we talk about service specific, independent identifiers, the question of which ones that they're in are in scope. So TN seemed like the most pressing case. And the reason for that is, of course, because of these things and the fact that so many systems seem to rely on being able to message to telephone numbers that are associated with our mobile device is. There may also be use cases. And certainly in the US, I'm well aware of the fact there are tons of, like, triple play landline services that are perfectly capable receiving text messages. In fact, because of the way that message routing works in the US. Just like a flag that is set by the ecosystem that is responsible for that routing. Determines what numbers can and cannot be eligible to receive. SMSes and MMSs as well. But, you know, with that, like, caveat aside, I think the, sentiment was expressed on the list that mobile numbers are kind of the pressing case, case, is a significant one, but Does anybody kinda disagree with that? I mean, do people in general feel like telephone numbers are the important thing. And more interestingly, how important our email address is as s Iis. Anyone like to go to bat? For maybe we don't need to have email addresses in scope of this. Victoria. Bits. I agreed the telephone numbers up likely to be the first case we we need to solve. I'm not sure about email addresses. I think if if you can make them work fine, otherwise, they're not so vital, but I do think that we should have something which is not depending on on another service. So you you should be able to use mini without also having to use telephone numbers to have a telephone or maybe in 10 years, there would be no mobile"

I I mean, I do see a couple of people here that I know have something small to do with email addresses and that do some work with email. From time to time in this room. I don't know if any of them would like to opine on, how important they believe in the messaging ecosystem, it is that people utilize email addresses as service independent identifiers. And again, remember, this is a case where you are messaging is decoupled from the host, your email address is what we mean by an email address as an s ii. Right? And so you can't rely on the fact that, you know, the person who issued you this email address is in fact your message service provider. That that is what it means for an email address to be an SII in this architecture. So I have a personal mail accounts. Ron, can you please and I could use it to sign up for 5 different services. We got a queue on this. And, Mister Scorler, you are 1st. Yes. So so I think I would argue for the I think, are you from the maybe you had started earlier? I think I think he's registering the chat.

You know, I think the I think the question I think we resolve the question of other identifiers. Not by not by reference to what we wish for, but what actually is. Which is to say, is there anybody who uses any identifier of the phone number like that isn't all that is there's any way, is I mean, so the the quality of the phone number or the email address are that they are universal and and and and fully fully fully fully distinguished"

And so my question is, anybody actually use And, you know, email addresses or some other, fully qualified, you know, thing as an identifier for the systems. And if the answer is no, then trying to make it work isn't that isn't that important you know, I think that the reason as you sort of indicated, why we won't might wish you a solicitation is if there are things that are enabled by making it a phone number and the the geographic, issues the most likely one. So, so so I guess I think that's probably the, like, the I hear they wouldn't go to any trouble pushing email out if I weren't for that, but it may be the case that simply is too hard to make it work with some other restrictions. Or at least we say, well, you know, we're not gonna have to grab a organization read me out but only for the numbers and start sorry you haven't have enough See, I I had the same question as, like, are there services out there that use email address as as SII's, and then I realized that Webex, in fact, How's that property? So the the the reachability identifier you're using Webex is, in fact, the email address of your corporate account, which Webex doesn't own. So there is at least one example. And, iCloud, I believe, does Yeah. Rowan says as wireless. I actually came to respond to to Victoria's point. I I don't think that There's a risk here that having meaningful require the use of a phone number. Like, regardless of how this discovery stuff sorts out, like, will have these SSIs. Like, if you can just distribute your SSI on your business card off you go, so is it like not at risk of having dependency on telephone numbers regardless of what we do It's Ben Campbell.

The reason why telephone numbers are Provider independent. Is because of the number portability requirements. I think email addresses have turned out to be provider independent because They live longer than my email provider. And I use them for multiple services. Without qualifying them, I have out of that. I'll list on that. I know as my log in. Far more. The sites than it's ever going to be safe. So Let's support both. In taking myself out of the jeeposaros. Okay? Who is remaining in the queue then? Okay. Yeah. This we've had a a similar thing with calendaring which has had a real problem with using email addresses identified because there, but a place that you can send an email and an identifier in a different system. And so you wind up having your calendar in a on a different host in your email, and it'll falls apart. Guess that's the same issue with telephone numbers as well, but as was already mentioned with telephone numbers, the provider independence that's been legislated in, with email If you start requiring anything on the email address, everyone's individual domain is gonna need to be to do it, which is going to be quite a nightmare. To get people to do. That said, I'd love to see email addresses in scope. It's just it's going to be a bigger problem the better off biting off separate levels and leaving email addresses for V2, I think it might make sense. It's tough. We got Ecker.

I mean, I would love to see email actually be fixed in terms of its cryptographic transport properties, But, but, am not convinced we can do that. That doesn't happen, we need to be able to move people who are on email to other places and Being able to move them with their same identifier is gonna be pretty important. So similarly to how all the messaging apps have moved people from SMS, to better transport. It would be a real soon Mimi could not do that for people who are using email. Yes. So I was just gonna find that this may not actually matter that much. Least at the level of the distribution of these mappings, There that distribution as far as I can tell is unlikely to use the exploit the internal structure of either a phone number or an email address. It's just opaque bytes. There may be some differences in how they're authenticated. Like, maybe you have stir search authenticate your, CN mappings and, you know, some emails, certain, you open PGP search talk about your email addresses, but first order, there's no difference here. Damn. Just a quick comment in that. I mean, the stuff I've been looking at for this or how we do TNA medication for this term messaging. You know, I think there are flows acme flows.

Mean, the one the one caveat I will point to this necker alluded to it is what's at the very bottom of this slide. This notion that, the difficulty of attaining the geopolitical location of email addresses may turn out to be difficult depending on our conception of the DP. Which will bring us right into the next slide. Next slide, please. Fundamentals of DPs. And, this is a biggie. And maybe I if we can get consensus on this in this room today, that would be fantastic. The fundamental question is, do we want DPs to effectively be a logical singleton, What do I mean by that? I mean by that is that is a service that has all of the mappings that is aggregating them. Of course, it could be in some sense a distributed, Service, Right? Right? And it could have, like, multiple instances to which data is replicated and so on, but you know, it do we want a conception of the DP where You can talk to it and any mapping that is in the Mimi ecosystem. Will be present in that DP. Versus do we want a sharded system? Right? Will various geopolitical or policy reasons require us effectively to have multiple. DPs that are going to be operated by different entities that have different data. And some of the considerations that kinda motivate these questions follow And, you know, practically speaking, for example, do we imagine that some MSPs may want to operate as their own DP."

From the discovery function is just learn I icloud MA route for this telephone number. Right. Should those people instead be required to, disclose and publish. To some kind of publicly available service. What the SSIs are. Behind all those entities that are, for example, associated with on cloud. That's a way to do sharding. There are these various geopolitical things where we think data is going to need to reside in various places. Because, you know, of just government regulations about, data hygiene and so on. And so there's, I think, a set of, countervailing pressures that we have to look at as we understand what the fundamental architecture of the discovery provider should be. And I'm really interested in people's thoughts. About you know, if this is a logical singleton or if we imagine there's going to be DPs. And, thus, potentially, you need for DP to DP communication. Concepts like there might have to be a home DP for your home message service provider that you consult first could potentially, of course, unfortunately, be a source of bias if that would steer you towards users that are already on their service.

Which is there are perhaps there are two questions. One is is there is there logically one thing or technologically multiple things. And the second is is there logically 1 DP for a given SII or there are or, eventually, multiple DP giving us that. So so this this example I gave earlier is, like, if you think about the DNS example, right, you know, you know, there's like one DNS, you know, because that's the one DNS author. Hey. I know they're money multiples for, for a given for a given domain name, but, of course, multiple domain multiple domain names that different authoritative. And, and and and if you got phone numbers the same way, right, you say, like, you know, in the example I gave him, my email, you could say, well, you know, the phone numbers are are up the DP for for a given, you know, the country code is operating in person, but you can always tell from the structure of the DP. Is there the country code who owns it? As opposed to the example, you have here, which is to say, that, in fact, there are multiple DPs, one associated with MSP, from a provider, you have to assembly, in some way, to query all of them, even if someone is responsible for pre query Right? And I think that's, like, a very fundamental, a question. Perhaps even, like, I I worry we're gonna be in the where, we actually have to query them, rather than because our people are not willing to provide it into the, into the system, I guess I would note, I'm I'm less concerned about this gatekeeping issue on, on the, in terms of your home MSP, like, gatekeeping for you, because it seems to me that one could easily have, you know, some independent independent entity, which is it was able to do it I mean, in in the limit, you simply do it yourself.

And, like, you know, but but because of that, again, they they could be in different geographic regions or or something.

Like, look at what the what, you know, does the information exist? First of all, like, you know, it's gonna be in these databases inside the MSPs. To start with. Maybe it gets replicated elsewhere. Maybe it gets authenticated somehow. But but but you know, that that's the starting point. That that's like the raw physics that we start with. To try and build our way towards this this ideal. Yep. And, I mean, I personally am starting to think that there's a logical authentication, function, we can call whatever we want that can reside in an MSP or potentially be independent.

For example, which is not something that Mimi is gonna facilitate, but it's certainly like an that will be available to any provider that's that's implementing Mimi. Right? So I I agree with what's been said about the likelihood that it'll logical singleton is not really a feasible solution, but I think we also have to realize that even if even if we facilitate the ability for there to be DPs in various different tictions. It's not necessarily the case that, like, that will absolutely need to be, for every MSP, you know, one in every jurisdiction where there's, there's there's gonna be a user. So I think it's kind of needs to be flexible in both directions, and we're not gonna be able to solve. We don't have to solve every case in protocol because there's other mechanisms by which people can meet their compliance obligations when just by the nature of the fact that they already have to send data outside of jurisdiction.
