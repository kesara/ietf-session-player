All these drafts have completed the last call we're waiting on review It'll be good to get the P three sr extensions to match the the Isi sis ones. We'll have the both done. Of terminology, that's just getting rid of the use of master and slave snowflake and follow. Follower. That's that's done too. So people vendors will be able to update all their documentation. Actually, I think they could now. You can update your your your your show commands and things like that. I I haven't looked I don't think there's anything in the yang model. Let's take a look at that. We're doing some corrections here on there were some corrections we did on the the application specific attributes those are also done. Some clarifications that we found.

In a kind of efficient manner. So because you know that the fax are go today, the actually be shared by different algorithm So therefore, if you want to tight individual kind of it, for fax algorithm, it will take a lot of, I mean, advertisements. So for example, if a nope with thousand names. Kind of averages and ten bytes if you're on ten k gigabyte with five thousand links.

So that means you don't need to have extra calculations for... I mean, that's a virtual fax algorithm share the same top. You do the one time at which the result we shared. This save time in the control plane to do this. So the relationship is very similar to Vlan and port account relationships. And but the but the need is sometimes you need different prefix it and the edge is set for different purposes. Okay? Although they share the same angle, Right? Then you will want to do that that way. So how to make it efficient? Also very efficient nature on a example is very efficient If you want to do like this way, just advertise around less than thirty bytes then you can build a new one. Okay. So the for example, this is The example here is for the elbow zero which just the we recap after the problem right, So if you see that the address is set from one zero nine this router, the thirty two which it this length is always being shared by different flex algorithms.

So this is very very easy. And then there's another few I add in this graph is the virtual fax algorithm. That means it will be a kind of base algorithm from, for example, one twenty nine. Then you can have the virtual file from six hundred or six zero one Today, you don't have that fast algorithm. Okay? More than two fifty five. K?

So the job of this one or high some of the extensions and the rest of the note here in this diagram were able to derive the figures of thirty two got two thousand, which is the offset. So we regardless how many lengths you have it would arrive. K. Next slide. So the relationship of the virtual fax algorithm and then the algorithm from the south, Okay? For example here is a six hundred. And six zero one, they share the same one twenty nine ton of top. So the same matrix, So Sim color Ig, whatever accounts things. Right? The Csp right work kind things, Right? But in the implementation, they can in different kind of relationship can be parallel. That means they all equal.

Because right now, in the extension, we only allowed advertise flex alcohol, which is up to two fifty five. How about up over two fifty five, two five six at onward. Then how to advertise it. So we need a kind of format, So it's also based on the this this is the base algorithm from. This is the virtual fax. For example, this is six zero six hundred. This is one to nine, then you can have a base algorithm to advertise to signal how this one relationship is. So this is why there's a a few with I will virtual effects Algorithm from. Okay.

And actually, the for the as well from Interface one to interface ninety nine, in the first column, So this is advertised. K?

The offset for the is six thousand for the prefixes six thousand. Then you can see the prefixes sales agencies are automatically right. So the saving is lot. Because it's just advertised to byte, here, you create new virtual fast algorithm from and another thirty, less than a, you create another one. So the saving is a lot because number interface is logged end to saving is much more. You see This is the only need to in the blue. Side all the the yellow side is the right of value.

So first of all, I'm not sure how real the problem is. I'm not talking about the virtual like I'll just about the regular flex. Problem would be relevant if you have lot of like on a lot of links. I'm not sure that is really. Because flexible is not the Vpn technology. Typically flags Go, the number of fax we would use would be a single digit number. And then my question would be we really need two mechanisms to advertise the same thing just to save some bites? Realistically don't see that as a need. And for the virtual flexible agree, I see. It has nothing to do with the flight please change the name. Yeah. Let me come on that one. Actually, if you look at today's router or or mean a mean single single router board, actually the line is four day ports. So in lung router, we're talking about maybe at least six cart, at least six car a next slot, with forty four. Right? You a two hundred and forty interface. In one box. It is possible. Yeah. And then if you have some relay in maybe a thousand. So there is a substantial number. We do have actually run quite a number interface at some layers. That would be a lot actually. Yeah. But that still you don't run out of the Ls space because of this. If you look at the link advertisement is a D, how many attributes do add? I mean, what is really the the problem here?

This job is not solving that's trouble. The reason why just like. How to use a vlan is not load balancing. You must have two ports. Okay. Okay two pause or two have different path, if you can do load balancing. So for example, we got fax Out go one twenty eight nine.

The second problem actually is in some cases, customer may want to have a single a, okay, similar alcohol. They have maybe a multiple adverbs, but most of... Me some cases in some cases they would like to in as kind of top they want to divide it a different kind of just like vlan cases, right similar to cases. Right?

Because handling of these metrics is clearly specify in the existing Rf saying you when you advertise this prefix, it should not be used for for routing purposes. So the spec basically says that you can advertise and use this metric when you advertise for other purposes then building the normal routing table. And basically we are adding one of these purposes and we we advertise. It still allows us to pay to be deployed incrementally because any route receiving a advertisement which is not use it for routing. So you know, we didn't have the the origin signaling the uk originally. But we got a feedback from the working group from several people that they would like to explicitly see that the reason why the Uk was originated was for the purpose of the unreachable. So you know we define to basically all jeans. One is being the loss of reach ability to due to unplanned and the other one is due to plan even.

In Of v two, we are using the Os sp to and the prefix Tl where we have the the flags field, we are defining again the two flags. And again, we are saying that you use on these flags, the magic must be set to elephant infinity otherwise. You ignore these flags. Complication for v three, we don't have the beats available so would defined we define a new prefix flags of Tl as a sub tl of the V, fine in the Rf c eighty three sixty two. And they part of the entire area internet area and external prefix Tl the two bits are the same. And again, if advertise must set to infinity. We also added a text in the draft, which talks about the area partition. They clearly say that the Was not manned and it's not meant to solve the area partition. It doesn't make it worse it can make it better in for certain conditions, but this is not the purpose of the Uk draft.

Took could could you clarify what the use case is for the distinguishing between the two types of events? Right. So so So these is this particular use cases is been brought by S.

I think this the solution of added an extra handshake in here at Ll level and complicating this the state machine is his is worse than the problem it solves when you have an unplanned restart. Anyway, give me next slide? I'm trying to be really fast. Right. However, however, If you look at section ten dot six of ours R twenty three twenty eight, That's the base os f b two location of which Rf c fifty three forty for Os three builds upon. I added in red Now we could word smith this to make sure that the route the neighbor of the router when it restarts it will it'll request the neighboring routers Router even if it's less recent, if it's anything, but same instance it's going to request it. So if if the neighbor of the restarting router has a previous instance of the router Ls it that is that that has a highest sequence request. It'll request the new one. You might say what if they are the same instance, but the contents is different. Well, in the instance calculation for All p Ls the check sums included that's not gonna happen. Anyway. So so what'll happen here rather than allowing this black hole is the restarting router if if if the... If the router ls is different, I mean, the the neighbor that is starting router if the router Is different we'll always request it The restarting router will send it send the its instance"
