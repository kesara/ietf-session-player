So allows it to announce prefix into the internet and those prefixes then propagate through the internet There are different. So there's a problem because if you would get one prefix from your provider and shamed as prefix. So another provider become transit for those 2 providers and router traffic. And this becomes a problem if you have 2 very large providers, because this will have your small network, overload you and impact the service quality. So here, Aspire introduces a business logic for verifying if a root should be propagated or not and a customer tell us which are its providers and here you can see a violation of the value for principal. A BGP announcement is propagated, upstreaming to their providers then the provider propagates the BHP announcement downstream. But this custom often, prop against, this BGP announcement again. To its provider and just and and now we can, verify with just as per information the developed free principle is violated And we did an implementation in that in the RTR lab and call will talk a little bit more about that.

Which defines a new frame for quick servers to enhance additional addresses. So here in our, a little example We have a server. So a client that is establishing quick connection to a server and then the server can send new additional addresses. And then the client can use them. Use them depends on the client capacity. So if the client is single path, it can migrate. To this additional address. If the clients is multi path, such as a multi path quick, I mean, it can establish new paths to those additional addresses. There's several use case for that. One is client simply losing one family, when they move from one network to the other, and then one address suddenly becomes and available others are on ipv6multiooming, mobile peer to peer servers that need to move and also, of course, multi pass click servers that have several interfaces. So the the implementation and turbine grade we had 5 open source implementation that were participating or more precisely, participant had modified those 5 implementation.

And as I specify when the symptoms and the incidents are found and, this can actually get stored and, and, and, and shared with, other people and actors. The software that we built relies on some already existing open source tools like influxdb for storing time series data, Grafana to visualize the, the the time series. And to annotate the the symptoms and incidents, and we build a service a, a yeah, a service called antagonist, which is about supporting this, It enrichment of metadata for symptoms and incident. And it's available on GitHub as as an open source project at at the link you see in the slides. The first step of, of course, is still reload the telemetry data on influxdb.

So the hackathon aims was to really analyze the possible leakage of privacy information across the federation. So that's between open roaming IDPs and ANPs. And this is a production service. So we've got to put probes, on real world networks access network providers, identity providers, and you can see the scribble there from our from our presentation that we're looking at, radius usernames, correlations, we're looking at user identifiers, we're looking at class attributes. So what did we learn? Well, we had by the end of the afternoon, in fact, we had radius logs exchange with 13 different IDPs production IDPs, and that enabled us to observe very different implementations in those, different, identity providers. We had 2 identity providers with explicit opt in with the IDP terms and conditions to share email identifiers and that email identifier is actually signals using the Chargeible user ID attribute. We have 9 out of the 10 reported here. Actually returning chargeable user identifiers in most cases, the CUI is a hash of some account ID. A single IDP doesn't re return chargeable user ID identifier, but uses class, to return what looks like a hash the user identifier plus some other fields."

But when we look at the radius logs, we see static CUI. Fact, we actually also see MZ in the clear in one instance of a class and another instance of a class, with a varying string next steps we're gonna continue this discussion in Medina this week on Thursday.

Well, maybe if you tried to connect the IDF dash net 64 network with your Linux laptop maybe everything works for you. Maybe you can see some more issues, like, if you type in IP folder somewhere. It just doesn't work. If you use some low level applications like virtual box or some VPN clients, maybe they're not working well. This actually has a solution and is already resolved in other platforms like you try the same thing with your Android phone, with some Apple device. It just works because there's this translator there. If you use Windows, well, it doesn't work unless you plug in a USB modem where the translator is there, but not for other. Things, But with Linux, yeah, maybe we can do something about it. So we tried, to do various things and, the result is that we have a demon in Python is listening to pref 64 options in route advertisements, and then then it can configure something, based on it, I mean, like, local translator, for instance, we have a similar implementation of, this in go together with, together with, not 64 prefix discovered by 750, 750.

So one thing that we did because of the new draft, missed release for the the MLDSA ML, SLH, and MOKN algorithms. So we updated, are testing appropriately to support those. So we have an artifact file because it's a zip file format for testing that. So we have updated that format. We've also we have an OID mapping table because we need to be interoperable. So we've updated as that, that as well to align with the mist draft specifications. Well, It's they're prototype boys because it's this has been given us pimotoids in yet until they're standardized, but the best we can do at this point. And, Yeah. We added a a table that describes of the source of the PQ algorithm. So we have a number of different implementations for unique actually at the moment, which is great for testing.

And probably the most important part is that we've made some Neptkin Protocol Design how we can even evolve and change the DNS and they removed some of its limitations. Essentially, it's very simple.

We wanted to write some plugins for existing popular HTTP proxies. To handle and resumable uplift directly. We also wanted to create a tool to easily test if a server implements a verification correctly. And, we also thought about building a JavaScript runtime for, or, like, implementing resumable uploads in, javascript run times, across all the board because there's quite a lot nowadays. And we also thought about implementing a polyfill, add removable uploads into the fetch API and browsers. But we didn't get through those. Maybe in the future, What we did get done is, as mentioned, we created a tool that you can point your Server 2, and then it says like, oh, hey, your, server implements the protocol correctly or there are these on that issues.

And, we were able to implement this indicator proxy because that was really easy. We also tried it for engine export was a bit more challenging. But in the end, it's working, and it's a great proof of concept So, yeah, what did we learn? Well, as mentioned, we see that implementing Zoomable uploads and proxies is quite handy and doable.

And the idea is really that we wanted to test if in implementations, measurement implementations, handled the initial with TCP correctly. In tours that I've seen in the past, in the in the past 20 years, some implementations that measure DNS over TCP They require seeing the session establishment first, the SINAC, you have data stored in, in, in, in pick up files, If the session setup might be in a different beacon file than the actual payloads. The other problem is that There are tools to assume that There's only a single DNS query response pair, over a TCP session. So We decided to just check for this long lasting TCP sessions, multiple TCP sessions, and then replay them against, some well known tools. We didn't do the second part. Had multiple approaches to to getting those, long lasting ECP sessions out of, pick up data. We use the digital data sets from DNS Ork to do this. What we've learned, m, these long lasting"

There are query restart, session restart, session resets in the middle of in the middle of, of, of a transmission. You see scanners doing bulk, DNS queries, you see enormous amount of resolvers, well known resolvers that have parallel TCP sessions, all doing a single query, all at the same time. So there's definitely room for improvement, but that's not what we set out to do. We just set out to to check if DNS tools were under reporting TCP. Apparently, they are not that's a good thing.

You may ask it's a mechanism that proves that a packet has a traverse a series of nodes that could be physical device or could be virtual functions. In a specific order. So, basically, this problem was, studied in the SFC working group and there's was a old draft, and then we are focusing on the same problem. And what we do is that we provide a working alternative but more efficiency and security. So what it can do is that it can help audit. And the routing path of a packet or monitor it, in the operations. And the code is right there in the GitHub And, it's very easy to to run. Right now, I've seen the proof of concept stage. And, there's also video and picture demo inside. So the difference that we compare to the old, solution is that they are using a cryptographic primitive called the Straumann of Secret Sharing. We are using something different. We're using vector commitment specifically, if the KCG polynomial commitment for some who may be interested in blockchain or the, 0 knowledge proof space. This is using the pairing friendly, ellipitous curse. And, the results in here is that the the size of the transit proof is constant. Thanks to the, this primitive itself. We didn't actually modify the primitive at all. The transit proof that is added to each packet is 24 bytes. And is regardless of the lands of your routing path. And the time of computing such transit proof"

So This is basically, I think this is I think this is too small, but, the upper left side is the controller and the rest are all routers. And basically, what it can do is that every router will compute his own transit proof and to see if I am in the right position, of a path of a path and also it can verify other people's transit proves and see if other people is in the right position of his path. And this is the right and the wrong, example. So what we learn is that it's, vector commitment is, interesting primitive. That has the position binding no property. And it's very nice to commit a routing path and verify the actual forwarding of the results. And, we have previously proposed to the offset working group And, what we learned is that we're doing the proof of transit and not proof of non transit. Which will be hard, and we cannot do that right now. And we read distilled better use cases to representing the security dispatch And, if you like it, you can come in there. And if you don't like it, you can hit it there. And, for a concluded surf, SFC working group and discovered a new solution after you're closed. Sorry. Thank you. Okay. Have you seen the end though?

And so we also wanted web apps to be able to talk to those BLE devices. We used to draft for that. Skim for devices for onboarding. And then, non IP control for the, communication with the ble devices. So what we were trying to solve was, We were trying to test and improve an open source implementation of tie dye, which was released just a few weeks ago, And we were gonna build a demo app that, uses several BLE devices to, monitor room environmentals in this room to basically prove that it's really cold here. And, the bonus that we got was a a very, very challenging artist environment. So we learned quite a few things, with that as well. So we improved the tie dye open source project, and we implemented CICD as well. How did how did we go about it? So, basically, so we built an app that uses, the skim for devices provisioning protocol. That provisions a network gateway. So we did that both with the open source and the Cisco implementation.
