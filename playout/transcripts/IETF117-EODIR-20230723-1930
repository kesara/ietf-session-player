This is a set of policies and regulation not regulations, but policies and procedures that we use. and the things that you agree to by participating in the IETF. In particular, it covers things like intellectual property, if you you are contributing work or you know of work that is associated with patents, you have an obligation to declare those patents, and there's a process for doing that. You also are acknowledging that you know, photography is is part of our process. that's not part of our process, but you acknowledge that you could be in and and photographs. It talks about our IETF process, our IETF. privacy policy, And then we have a whole list of RFCs or BCPs talk about the various parts of the IETF, and all of this is covered in the note well. If you have any questions about it, please feel free to ask. I'd also like to point out we do have an anti harassment process. and procedures for that, and we do have a code of conduct. So the next thing, that we have is tracking because we are in open standards an open standards organization. We do need to keep track of roughly who was in the room and participating. So every room that you come into will have this QR code on it. And Meet echo is the tool that we use. So This helps us keep track of who attended the meeting. In the old times, in the before times. We also talk we talked about blue sheets. So we also now also have a a version of this where you can hand it around. so we're gonna go ahead and start passing this around the room. if you have not logged in or checked in this this QR code."

So when you when you get when you access it, it logs you into this meeting, this session. so when you go to the proceedings afterwards, you'll see everybody that attended this session. and and there should be a live count. Michelle's looking at it. I can't see it from here, but The number of people in this room should represent the number of people that are in meet echo. plus of online people. And that's the other thing to understand about the IITF, and we'll talk a little bit more later about this tool. but but we we have and I forgot the exact numbers. I think we have something 400 virtual people registered for this meeting. And so when they come in, they get counted as attendees as well. And when we do queue management, we'll talk about this a little bit later. We manage everybody has to use the hand to get in the queue. And then that enables the virtual people to have the act the opportunity to participate at the same level as everybody else. you have any questions or problems with this process, today is an excellent day to get them worked out. You can talk to to to us afterwards, or just asking any session. So I I alluded to this a little bit, but this is the how to ask a question in a session. So you You are gonna need to use Meet Echo. You're gonna need to use it all week. It'll be on your laptop or on your phone. the way that you will ask a question is you will add yourself to the queue. And then you can see the cue, you see the yellow You know, I can see that there's two people in the queue right now, and we can see them over there. add yourself to the queue both in person and virtual.

If you push the hand, that puts you in the queue to ask a question. So it's a 2 it's Got it? Alright. So So that should get everybody started on how to get in line and how to ask questions and the meetings, Alright. So so The last thing we have in sort of meeting management or meeting you know, just sort of things that are useful to know is Lanyards, pins, and buttons. The IETF really likes signage, and we have signage for a whole bunch of different things. One of the things that we wanted to point out to people is have 2 different colored lanyards. We have green lanyards and red lanyards. group shots, of of everybody, you you have consented to have your picture taken. If you would rather not be in individual shots or small group shots, than wear a red lanyard. But please don't wear a red yet lanyard just because you prefer the color red. So green lanyards, because, you know, you're fine with having your picture taken. red lanyards if you would rather not have individual pictures taken. Okay? That's specific to this meeting. I will tell you that in other meetings, we've Generally speaking, our red lanyards are always the one that say don't take my picture, please, but the green but it Usually, they're white lanyards. at the last minute, we had to edit our slides because we said white lanyards in Then we realized we had no white lanyards this time. So screen lenders this time. but The next thing is pins. You know, we're a little bit"

The green square means that you are comfortable with you know, any any reasonable level of contact in a professional setting you know, if you meet you're greeting an old colleague and you're happy to give them a hug, then, you know, that would be that. If you are yellow, if you choose a yellow triangle, then, you know, you're somebody who would like, you know, elbow bumps or you'd like some some level of caution. And then if you are somebody who really wants to maintain that the separation, then you have the red thing red What's five sided? just lost my Pentagon. There we go. red. The last thing that we have that's the hard The default, if you don't wear anything is, ask. I I guess the default would be to ask or or, you know I mean, generally speaking, you're greeting people either you know or you don't know. So whatever you would use in a professional setting. you know, don't don't tackle people in the hallway or things like that. The the last thing I wanna talk about on meeting management are language buttons. We have people hear from all over the world. If you speak another language, there's buttons that help you indicate which language you might speak. so you can choose one of those and indicate to other people who might speak the same language that you are fluent in that language. So that's all the basic meeting stuff. Now we move on to the overview of the IETF. So The mission of the IETF is to make the Internet work better. by producing high quality relevant technical standards. influence the way people design use and manage the Internet This goes all the way back to RFC 3935."

The basic ethos of the IETF that anyone can participate, It's an open and transparent organization. Also, all of the work product is available for free. and little bit later, we'll talk about some of the tools that make that easy for you to see, but I think the the one you really wanna pay attention to is datatracker.ietf.org. all of our meeting minutes, all of our drafts, all of our standards, the charters of all the working groups, the charters of all the concluded working groups. Everything is available through the data tracker. It takes a little bit of, you you know, a little bit of practice to get used to it But that's that's be one of your key sites. It's one of the most important things we're seeing, what the IETF is currently doing. Contributions are judged on technical merit. any technical questions are welcome and encouraged, It doesn't It doesn't matter what company you come from or know, what, you know, what organization you represent. If you have, you know, read the drafts, and you have something to contribute technically to the work than it is welcome in this environment. And then the final thing is is that the Success is determined by voluntary deployment. So we we are not a regulatory body. We can't require people to implement things. And so you know, We developed the standards. We put them out there. and successful standards are the ones that people use. And, you know, Not all standards are successful. know, whether they're required or not. And so, you know, we have some that have been more successful than others. So the next thing is a little bit more detail. So At its heart, the IETF is a standards development organization. There's a lot of types of standards development organizations out there, and we are international one that develops the standards"

So you do have affiliations, And it's understood that you know, if know, if I work for company a and they're paying my bills come here, then I'm not going to I'm gonna represent their interest. So but it is individual participants. driven by market based adoption, which I've already talked about quite a bit, focused on the Internet Technologies. and it's bottoms up. And so It starts with an individual submitting a draft and gets built up from that way. We don't formal voting, We do what we call rough consensus, and there's another slide later about the definition of rough consensus. Yeah. We do take the pulse of the room, we take the pulse of the mailing list, and from that, we determine what we believe the rough consensus is for something and move forward based on that. There is no formal government role. However, there are governments individuals from governments participate all the time. and there's no you know, it's It's not this is not a a trade show type of meeting or a sales meeting. This is a This is a working meeting of people developing their tech allergies. So this is the big picture of the IETF. and you know, there there's a lot of acronyms on here but I imagine that some of you have Some of you are more familiar with this organization than others. But The big blue circle, have all of these little working groups. Working groups are arranged into areas. and then the areas comprise the IESG.

Now research groups are working on technology that might be deployed in the future. They're also working on things like Internet access for all. So there's a number of research groups and the the they're a little bit more loosely organized, They have a little bit more flexibility in their charters. and they are managed by the group called the IRSG. There's also an Internet architecture board. And the Internet architecture board is made up of a set of people that basically provides overall guidance in Internet Architecture and also manages all the Liaison relationships and outreach the IETF. So if there is you know, if the ITU and the IETF are coordinating on a standard that liaison relationship is managed through the IAB. The final organization that is part of this community is the IETF LLC. the IETF LLC does all of the administrative work for the IETF. So You know, they sign the contracts. They have some staff. They do the communications around the IETF. They help you know, develop training. So if it's administrative, and supports the functioning of the IETF that's done by the LLC. 2 parallel organizations that are also involved in the IETF. is the RFC editor. So the RFC editor is the organization that manages the a publication process of our standards. And the Ayanna is the Internet assigned names and numbers, and they manage our protocol numbers and things like that. So you're developing a protocol and you need a port number or you need a, you know, a list of of registry values, then all of that. is published and managed by IAnA. So, That"

These are the current areas that we have. areas can change a little bit, the number of area directors can change depending on the current workload. So the current areas that we have, we have applications in real time. So that looks at your you know, your voice over IP, SIP type of protocols, and real time communications, things that support audio video and things like that. We have a transport area, which does a lot of the work on TCP, and congestion control, and those kinds of things, and probably more interesting a lot of you right now is the the evolving quick protocol, which has come out, and there's a lot of work ongoing and quick right now. The routing area, we had currently have 3 area directors to handle all of the work in the routing area. and that looks at the routing protocols So your BGP and those kinds of things all fall into that area. The Internet area, which does basic Internet protocols, all of the work done on ipv4, ipv6, domain name system, you know, dynamic host configuration, mobility, That is all done in the Internet area. There's operations and network management, so we do have some operational working groups here. So, for example, the DNS protocol work is done. in the Internet area, But there's a DNS ops working group, which looks at the operational issues. best practices associated with running the DNS system, That work is done in the operations area. So, If you go back a number of years, we used to do mid modules, and now we're doing Yang. And they're, like, the the next generation of management.

Any document that gets published, The security area reviews it, and there's a number of other areas that review it. And the final area that we have is the general area enough there's only one meeting this week in general area called Jen Dispatch. But that area looks at you know, the activities around the administration of the IETF, updating processes, updating, you know, the rules under which we operate. So some of the topics that have occurred in that area, a few years back when we were doing the work to transition from the old IAOC structure to the new IETFLC structure, you know, that was sort of changing how the IETF was was organized administratively. All of that work was done in the general area. also the work to when we evolved the RFC editor model, that work was also done in the general area. So it's those kinds of things that fall into that area. So I mentioned earlier, I sort of hinted that we might talk a little bit about Consensus. you know, the IETF mantro, or I'm not sure what the right word for this is now, but the know the, you know, the, you know, the favorite saying of the IETF is that we reject kings, presidents, and boedings. We believe in rough consent and running code. Yes. So what exactly does that mean? Well, So there's a whole RC on that because, well, we are the and we write RFCs on all sorts of things. So the idea behind rough consensus is that you get rough consensus when all of the issues have been addressed, They may not necessarily have been accommodated or agreed to. the group may decide that you have a point We understand your point. but we've decided we're gonna go in this other direction."

So we hear the consenting opinions, but they don't necessarily stop us in our tracks. one of the ways that we do measure consensus and it it kinda depends on the various working groups. but it seems to be the way that makes the press a lot. is we do harm. And the idea behind humming is that it's a way to measure consensus without voting. And part of the reason for that is you can gather from sense of the room, that the you know, not only the number of people that are supporting or objecting to something, But you can also get an idea of how passionately they do. So, you know, if you ask everybody, know, did you Did you like the food at breakfast this morning? then you might you know, people would like, and they might come softly. And then if you ask them, you know, did you And and drawing a blank on an example. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna practice coming because Michelle and Rich really want us to practice something. And so the question is going to be, Would you rather hear Michelle speak next? or would you rather hear Rich speak next? And so everybody that is in favor of Michelle speaking next a a. and everybody who's in favor of Rich speaking next, So So in any event, That that's a demonstration of humming.

There's nobody standing at the mic asking questions. you know, the the the stuff is moving forward, and you don't need to do it. I've also done some work in IEEE, and one of the things that I, you know, noted there is we have You know, you have voting. and, you know, everything had to be voted on. that's one way of doing things. is a different way of doing things. Yes. Handset. part of what we're doing now, because still working on the whole virtual part of this is There is polling available in METEcho, and that's the other thing that can happen. And that does look suspiciously like voting because you end up with tallies of numbers But It is what it is. the other thing to note is that Anything that any consensus call is supposed to be validated or taken back to the mailing list. So All of you happen to be sitting in this room, but there's another 30 or 40 people that might care about this issue that are not sitting in this room. so we're as working group chairs, we're supposed to take the consensus back to the mailing list. So that is IHF and consensus. So the next thing is joining working group and contributing to existing work. I mentioned the data tracker earlier. Every working group has data tracker page. And from that data track tracker page, you can see You know, the about is the charter of the working group. The documents list the documents that are currently being worked on in that working group and that have already been worked on."

So The process of contributing to a working group is you join the mailing list, review the documents that are currently in progress. have any questions, you can contact the chairs, you comment on the mailing list, or you comment in the meeting. of the things that we are doing is we're seeing a lot more of our work move to GitHub. And so you can you can Also, follow more actively the development of the document And what you'll see in here is sort of snapshots where the document has evolved for a while on GitHub and then they publish an update, and so that'll be the next version you see here. The next thing people ask a lot is, you know, how do you get new work into the IETF? So the i TF is, as we mentioned, it's a contribution driven bottoms up process. So the first thing that happens is somebody has to identify a problem. that needs solving. And then have to fig you have to find other people that also agree that it is a problem that needs solving. And then does the problem fit into one of our areas? And we've already about what the areas are, and does it align with the architectural principles of the IETF? of the Internet. So is the scope well defined and understood? you know, Are we past the research stage and onto the engineering stage? So we're ready to you know, if it's something that's still research oriented, maybe that should go to the IRTF. If it's something that we're at the engineering stage and we're ready to develop standards for, then that's probably that is appropriate for the IETF. And then you get some sort of agreement on timetables and milestones, and you know, for anybody that's worked in the standards arena for a while, you know, that those timetables and milestones, are they slip a bit sometimes. They are aspirational. And then you have to have willing people to do the work because this is at its core. You know, we don't have a large staff, so the the standards are developed"

So this is a little bit more detail. In particular, it's a tiny bit dated, but there is a tutorial online about bringing new work to the IETF that does a really nice job in talking about that. If you have any interest, if you have specific things, you know, the the key first step is having that idea and figuring out who you're set of collaborators would be in, you know, in the IGF The last thing in this section is the funding model for the IATF. So up. you know, we come to meetings, But the work of the IETF is much bigger than just the the meeting 3 times a year. there's a a variety of support to ensure that the work continues There's the registration fees for the meetings. Obviously, that helps to fund the fund it. There's also donations, corporate sponsors, see a lot of signage here on sponsors. And so if anybody has any interest in more about the the financial model for the IETF then there's a link there for that. And with that, I'm going to hand it And I know that you all voted for Michelle. Nope. And I know that the consensus was Michelle over Rich However, I, as working with Chair have overruled this consensus and sided rich goes next. Did you have a So back on the event block stage, and new. So I can see that some graphs good graphs have expired. When does a draft expire? Who decides that it has now expired? So that's a a good question. And a draft expires there's a timer on it. So every time you publish a draft, It has, like, 6 months. and then either that draft is updated or it expires. so there is good work that if it's not and it And I don't have it in this set of slides, but you you will see often in data tracker,"

Now that's the other really important thing about the IITF is it expires but it never actually goes away. because it's still it It's still archived in the data tracker. So you can find the work that's been expired for years and it's still there, found And just as sort of a side note, A lot of documents in the IATF You know, RFCs have different status and drafts have different status. Anything that's a draft can is just somebody's idea, somebody's contribution. It does not represent the position of the IETF. It doesn't represent the position of a working group necessarily. You know, I I could I could publish a draft that says, you know, I've decided that the the sky is green and the glass and the grass is blue, And that would be in there as a draft. The fact that I published it doesn't make it true. It doesn't make but the IETF believes that that's the case. And then also when you look at RFCs, you know, that some of them are standards Some of their informational, some of them are experimental.
