    "text": "spelling fixes but actually require some work but it\u0027s um some work willing to happen on the draft so but we hope that once of the design issues are more or less done we can hope is that the drafts enter a period of stability where maybe a Troyer stuff gets fixed but we\u0027re not hopefully gonna do more design work and that allows the implementations to catch up hopefully this could be after the September October inner end so we will say what we said before that maybe in Singapore if that plant hands out we can actually spend the session on some things that are not be one related and there\u0027s there\u0027s quite a few proposals around I think the the ones that certainly seems to draw a lot of interest inside the IGF it\u0027s things related to RTC web there was the whole dispatch thing yesterday and but if there\u0027s other things that we have for example multipath as an item on our Charter which is it feels like this will be a much harder much longer-term thing and it\u0027s also maybe not quite as urgently needed as the RTC stuff but RTC could be a topic that we spend a session on in Singapore if you guys stop opening new design issues for a moment Eric Eric Kinnear Apple there\u0027s also the quick I\u0027ll be draft which in my mind is kind of coming with the one not with the stuff after and we should probably give that some airtime and ask people that like read it correct cuz that\u0027s another one that we\u0027ve maybe been forgetting exists that is one that sort of I feel that this has a natural home in this working group while the RTC web discussion is a much larger one right and there will certainly be most pieces probably will not be in this working yeah but by talking saying we\u0027ll spend some time talking about something like RTC whatever it doesn\u0027t mean that that work will be done here it just means it will start to have a discussion with me so we\u0027re talking to the area directors about what the proper dispositions of things like extensions versus new applications using quick might be this is about nuga I\u0027m gratified to hear that you believe that that this working group is the home for that however I remind the chairs that has not been adopted and I wish and I said it\u0027s not a home for it potentially not we still haven\u0027t decided what the disposition for things like extensions and new applications using clickers are going to be Oh quick I\u0027ll be specific quick I\u0027ll be specific lecture yes so um I not not probably Montreal but I would like certainly in the interim to get some time to discuss it with a group and move for adoption and then we can iterate further off of there I think it\u0027s important that it at least be an adopted document before we go to RSC would be one the people have guidance on how to do this and I think that the the discussion of that is is probably a prime thing for Singapore that sense yeah or maybe even at the internet way up time it would probably require some small amount of recharging because at the moment we have a pretty specific list of work items and that isn\u0027t one but but you know we wrote that "
