This person has very few changes from the previous one. I will explain the last is right why we have not done so many changes. Next one, please. So, basically, the the problem is that in Ip six hundred net growth when using nets sixty four, if if there are devices which are Ip only, and we have content delivery or catches or things like that. The traffic will be translated later unnecessary to from my four p six and then back to pv floor. So this is this event that's compared to using calorie brain next, please. So this this is the typical for six four six four x deployment. Next one, please.

Of course, because we have already done translation type six. So next one, please. If we can use that translation to Ip six, Then we can achieve this this Okay? So that's that's the goal of of this of this document. Now next one, please. We have studied in the document three approaches. The first one is a Dns routing based approach. And the main issue of which this approach is that it needs the cdn or catch providers to do something. Okay? This is actually the way they do which Ip before, but when we were asking to to content deliver in if they will be happy to do something similar for A six, they set principle not. So it seems that this is not the best approach. At least it was the case when we to the see they must common on. Next one, please. The second approach is using table an automatically built table in the City. Okay? So because most of the time, the Cities are doing the Dns proxy. We can work on a solution based on that.

Next one, please. The full approach is having the Isp to provide the translation type table instead of being develop it internally by the Cp itself. So that's that's an approach that also has different issues like the increase some complexity, and we believe that it's not core therefore, that it guides the from the from the provider. Next one, please. And this is the set of questions that are open from the discussion from the previous version. Okay? So One of the questions that goes raised goes optimization should be disabled by by the default, Google that not because in the document is very clear that if there is no four sixty four x being used the optimization of course is not enabled. Okay. That's the first one. The second one is if there is no nuts sixty four discover it is also not enabled. I think some of this same square from Eric and some others from Jen, I believe mostly, there were some questions also from Edwards so if they are here.

There was also comment about consumer electronics like I believe it was the Chrome test using alternative resolve supported. That's something that we are already discussed it. And then there were some issues about additional security considerations. We believe that the mechanism that we are proposing is not actually increasing the security problems that exist already when you are using proxy dns ns or something like that. And I think that's that's. Not working. Yep. Just... This one's working. Joe Aka? That's a little clear. The the thing that I'll I'll comment on on your proposal number one is that this the Cdn, were unlikely to use any sort of network that goes and dust you know, touches the packets because the support issues that will run into in actually interacting with the the Isp around that and how it allows our servers to be used and leveraged. I don't think very many service providers actually wanna sign up for that problem space of actually debugging that. We see a lot of transient issues that cause us to go and reroute stuff and the public Internet is actually not has proven to not be very good actually for doing the cash fill or cash hierarchy key as well, which has resulted in us building private network"

And so we've taken control over a lot of that in order to ensure that we actually get the operational performance that's necessary to keep our customers very happy. So it's unlikely that a proposal like this, even if it were deployed, would it be able to be used by many of us because we would actually likely end up bringing our own solution did not have to go through some intermediary layer. And also go in and, you know, the the support issues that any provider would create for themselves by doing this is gonna be extremely high. Because you're gonna have to understand a lot about you know, for example, our own application behavior and such. Which is it's unlikely that we'll share all of that. But if I understand you correctly, you mean approach number one. Correct. Yes. Yeah. That that was my point that in the case of you are actually allowing private space to come come directly to the to the to the. But in Ip six, we don't have that that solution. So approach one is not good. And this this was our point already. Yeah. So we agree. Thank you. Free takes a few seconds for audience to turn on So this document was expired for somewhat more than two years.

I think you did a great job addressing a bunch of them I we I think there's a number of those that are still significant issues. So I think the thing that worries me the most there is really the support issue risks that that like, I think we watch some experimental experience with this to really kind of work through some of the issues. I think there could be a lot of cases it would be to experiment. Which starts we'd start showing up there. And if this did start getting deployed in that option two, range at a wide scale basis. I worry that it might cause broken as and support issues, which might then cause Cdn customers to try to switch content back to Ip before only. And I also get... It has been a few years since we were talking came up this last, and there is there has been progress on at least to some degree On v four only client. So it maybe that at some point by the time this got implemented? May be that the number of four client only higher to become small enough that this becomes most valuable than it would have been a few years ago. Thank you. Hi. Jenny. Yeah. I to build the I two need to recall exactly we you were talking about last time, but I did look at the diff between versions.

It's users and probably, I support So it would be interesting here to see like some data on how much of problem we solve because I do anticipate on Cps because Cp has always been a problem with deployments. Right? It's exactly where a bugs are. So your are exist which is rather complicated non obvious and failure scenarios would be very exciting. So I'm still a bit concerned about this to be honest right from a operational perspective. And so, yeah. If you could give us more data or more details about how we go those that would be. Great. Thank. Actually, the main problem why, the the document was a stock is because we had two cp vendors that agreed to provide samples of this, and it never happened. So we wait it and it and and we never got that. But we know that's that's something that commonly happened with new transition mechanism or things that we ask to to the vendors to to improve. So that that was the main reason. And and the reason there is not big differences because when we look at the inputs from the previous document, we go waiting for for the the sample from the Cps. We we realized it that we basically as as out with within with some of the comments, they they they went already resolve it in the previous version, so that's why you cannot find too many changes with the obviously.

Finally, your your point about what it goes oh. Chris For who is the advantage of this is basically for the. Because some peaceful are telling us we prefer to use current way not because in Gutter we're not, we don't have this overall for the Cv traffic because we have a solution But if we use like, six only, we don't have that solution.

This is a draft about doing prefix delegation. In the home. So next slide. Wrote this last hundred the last Ipo, So I have a presented here yet. So the real problem statement we have here is We've done a really good job getting prefixes larger than slash sixty four from Isps to the runner. So the prefix... The top here is there's an edge in your house from your service provider, typically, you can bring your own too, but They're there, and they're getting these large prefixes, but they're not getting beyond those routers. So what's happening today is a lot of them sit there they get the prefix and they're allowed to assign it to guest networks. Are networks they have connected. But doesn't go beyond that. So this graph is trying to address that problem. Next slide. So this is the typical top. So this is what is happening today, I would say, is we get a lot of really nice eighty six spreader that get slash fifty six is slash sixty slash whatever, get those addresses? And then The guy below it plugs in, the typical Ip v six seven eighty four router. Whatever little v router you have in your home."

Because the Isp device is not doing prefix delegation on its lan interface. So gets no answer, so that's really should be a frown face at the bottom. He has no v. Connectivity set. So just to... I wanted to go over this really quick because this has come up a couple of times with this draft. So there are two models to solve this problem. We went down this road a very long time ago for those who are for familiar? We talked a lot about this. There were some drafts one of it worked out. That was... I don't know ten years ago. Little bit less. So I just wanted to talk about what the two options are hierarchical deal is taking large prefixes and breaking them up and basically, you have to put rules in the Cp tell them how to do this. Whether it's take a slash sixty to break it up take a slide fifty six depending on what you get this algorithm gets pretty complex, and we've not seen her. I have not seen anybody attempt that other than the cable apps guys. They do have some going on there. On the docs in particular in the Us. What this model proposes is is what we call flat. So in this case, the Isp router is the only one with the Edge router. In this case, is the other one that's gonna giving out prefix delegation? Everybody else is gonna be getting it from that edge router. Okay. So this is the really simple one. I've got a couple of top allergies coming. This one's really simple and that In this case, you just basically cut on Ip on the land. It answers it. It gives out of slash sixty four. Go the next one. V, we're fine. One should be pretty straightforward for. The next one is where it starts to get interesting. So in this case, You have two routers are connected somehow directly underneath the device under test. I put seventy eighty four routers. These can really the Iot devices whatever it is a router that needs is give it out"

They get they both put requests for D's and then the Ceo router answers them. Pretty straightforward. On the downside. So it still works. Everything's fine. This is pretty normal to most people most deployments. Okay. Here's really we get a little fancy. The deal here is when we build a network like this, and this case there's a edge router it's coming from the service provider one it's gonna have a router connected to it and then the one last router Iot device sitting on the end. So what we did in the draft, What the graph says here is that routers who are not the edge router should become Dhcp two v six relay. So they should pick up prefixes behind them, pick them up and relay them all the way up to the edge. Router. Right? So this solves a couple of the problems of being able to support a flat hierarchy where you can have Dhcp messages to travel over multiple links. Alright. There's a couple having gone through those top apologies. There's a couple of changes here. One thing. Obviously, the first most important here is we want Ia support to be on see your honor on the edge. So one thing we should do here is hey, we should turn that on. The only other requirement we've added to those guys is that they have also have to be able to process relay messages. That's not normal. For I pay six router. So that's one thing we're adding. Additionally, a lot of them are gonna have to support relay agent. Some of them do now surprisingly. Actually, this is better supported than For some reason. Don't understand it, but that's what's been going on. So that's another thing is they have to port agents Those are the major changes we've made. Go ahead in the next one. Okay.

A later date. Go ahead in the next slide. So if we wanna do a seven eighty four biz, know don't wanna open... I would not suggest that we open it for everything. It's been doing pretty well. I do think there's a couple of cleanup ups we could do. There's a lot of reference get a lot of emails about supporting thirty three fifteen. Things that we fixed in eighty four fifteen Obviously, the eighty two hundred and eighty two zero one. There's some other updates there that we've made along the way. We should just update all those what's in the prefix lane draft, We we remove the transition text nineteen ninety six does a much better job. You just take out the six Rd and light stuff that's in there now. Just remove it point to the. And the last thing we should do because this comes up all the time and Cv attacks.

Next slide. Because I won't what I wanna do, all those stuff is for you to look at later if you want. Basically, what we did was is we moved our server behind the Cdn so we can control it. Okay. Next slide. And so this is kinda of what it looks like. We have a domain name is behind the Cdn. Okay. Next slide, And so Diet... So Cdn can do Dns and Dns prop see. Although why anyway we do just Dns and beyond me, okay next slide. And so what we if we tested a bunch of things. So Okay. So gonna slow down here a little bit. If you have a dual stacked web server and Dns a lot of times the Cdn is preferring Ip four. It's doing a proxy kind of business. And it's got two different connections."

The extension headers won't follow. Okay. That's interesting. Next slide. If you do Dns early at the Cdn, then you've got a simple client server top in that case everything works.

And what we did in November And in November, you can see that they have thirty one percent of the sites responding if there was an extension header. And in February, was a hundred percent. One of the cd providers had found a bug in their load balance code and fixed it, and you could see it is fixed. And so now extension headers are being passed. Next header.

Morning, Accidentally liquid. I kind of said this the Ip meeting yesterday, but just for those that went there, so main issue here and I think Warren also kind of elaborate done it quite eloquently on the chat was the fact that proxies or Cdn are working at last seven not the Ip and transport layer. So that's why the E doesn't get all the way through. Now it does... You you've kind of hit the nail on the head with the question of should we look at a way of signaling to the Cdn or a provider to say, hell, we want some to go all the way through But then the question comes as how do you get that response?

And the issue with let Cdn being layer seven proxies. Is a separate issue from the the because that cheddar getting dropped problem and it's unclear to me what that that in the case we you have a layer seven proxy that sending extension headers through to an origin completely the un unrelated connection necessarily makes sense.

For each one of them. It's not clear to me what the behavior you would want should be for something like that. And so I don't think that they're actually is a problem there per s.

We presented the draft very briefly twenty five slides or second in London, So let's now spend a bit more times so I can explain the details what we are doing why and how it can be useful used. Next slide, please. Sure. Let's start from the very beginning. Unlike an Ap before, Ip six world, hosts I expect to have multiple addresses. And in most cases they do So obviously, they will have in most of the cases. Host would have stable and privacy addresses. Well, Should not point out it might be just temporary address, but So now as we start the deploying we only, we also six address to a host, So basically, you can easily get four Not. Without doing anything special. Then I have been doing a lot of network numbers and actually. And it means you basically doubling the number of global addresses for a while while you're doing grace number. So seven."

And at the end of the day, We have an rf which strongly recommend not to limit the number of addresses per. So we kind of expect hosts have multiple addresses. What does it mean? It's great thing but it might come with a cost for a network. Next slide, please. First of, it does have some scalability implications. Obviously, routers need to maintain neighbor discovery caches. Which means one entry three per address. All this smart infrastructure like switches, points, do like to track Ip addresses assigned to host for doing a discovery proxy or for security reasons. Which means again, they have those tables and sometimes those tables are way too small for the number of addresses you can see in the network. Also, if you decide to deploy E, It means you now most likely will have type two routes which means you move from fore well you have one out per, you might have five seven eight ten routes for the same number of devices, which actually completely different scalability requirements when you buy hardware.

What we suggesting is host can request sixty four and y sixty four tell you later. And diaper. Okay. So a network can delegate the prefix to host and host can use that prefix to assign as many addresses as host needs, to its interfaces or actually even to any downstream or internal systems connected to that host.

Let's say have a phone, I have her machine with host system and a couple of virtual, smart machines, And obviously, we're gonna have a lot of entry entries since the nab or as I said, in access points, for example, Ip to mac address tracking tables.

Next slide, please. Let's talk about benefits of this as one was someone told revolutionary approach. So scalability, if I said, Now I can scale my network which means buying hardware. To the number of points and not the number of addresses. Next slide, please. Second benefit, potentially, not immediately. Is that we have a chance of eliminating neighbor cash attack. Because it's very long problem. Right? If you have directly connected slash to four configured on the interface. If someone is trying to scan your network, Router, Will have to create incomplete entries for every other has been scanned And potentially, you can exhaust the cash.

Well, I have such examples my corporate network internal Wifi, which only corporate energy devices can connect to. I know operating system on them.

And I was using not So from my perspective that device was actually just single While actually, it was something behind it.

For example, we have like some kitchen equipment, we show like a host I I took a screwdriver open it. It's actually router for ports switching side and a couple of tablets connected. So how can you tell without physically opens the device? The most discussions we got on the list was about y sixty four for very simple reason.

So next slide, please. So, yeah, this is it's not like we suggestion to for every network to deploy it immediately. The which would benefit from this most, a large ones.

So it basically means that what we want is to for the network to be able to see now, hey, I'm am concerned about my resources, so please use Pd. And in small networks like home networks, it should not happen. Right? So the client should not be try and using Pd even if the router is steam proposed, delegate the prefixes on the request. Right?

So also, we want the if delegation capable device, to ignore And do not use addresses from, we theoretically can start Pd get address from And one Pd completed remove addresses form from Pi, but that would be very intrusive for an application.

I'm not gonna justify why to this room because I don't need to. As a network operator. But one of the trends and one of the challenges of Ip v six is there's so many ways to do everything. I have a number of technologies and methods and techniques to get an address? And when you talk about Dhcp v six, I it's amazing. I can support thirty two different relays.

For web transport v, v six, all of the privacy addresses, the rotating of those I understand the utility of this. With this, now you're gonna make the devices more track. Because they're going... They're going to go and get the a stable v six address. You know, a slash sixty four per device, and that's gonna be great for the companies who want to go and engage in end user tracking behavior.

Why? My server... My my machine rotated off the privacy address, and I can't use it anymore. And I may want that on my specific host workstation. But to go and reconfigure them all, to go and do this. Is an issue. So my question to You, Jen in part, but really this is more of a question to working group to the chairs in Ad is how many ways do we want V six to be able to select an Ip address. Because there is a host of proposals that are out there and a host of Ip addresses that end up on these devices. You know, just a ton of them. And whether or not a device is it is a proxy gateway or is it router? I think is irrelevant. I think the question is, how do we want to get these addresses?

The goal here is to sort of highlight, you know, things that have changed in that, you know, site resiliency is more important now than it was, you know, five ten years ago, the idea of having full connectivity and in a given location is is a lot more similar to, you know, the electricity working than it used to be. So with Ip six, that's a little bit of a of a difficult task to scale when you don't have resources or if you may not have the ability to do certain things like Pi address space. So what we've done is really laid out like what you can do. Next slide So this is sort of an increasing levels of desi and complexity. So the Pi based solution, this is the most common one, it's if you have your own address based, As, you connect to multiple providers, everybody knows what this is. Right? This is this is what all the big the large environments will do because they have the resources to do it. And I'm not gonna go through all of the details of each of these everybody really knows what they are. But we lay out the advantages and the disadvantages of each one Right? This is a obvious one. Next slide? This is where it very quickly dev evolves into hard and and and less fun. As soon as you get into a situation where you have provider assigned addressing and you have multiple providers it doesn't really even matter what your Cp is, how many of them there are it just becomes very difficult to lay out the the addressing in a in a redundant manner. So This is an option. We've made it work it's very complex. And it's very clunky."

It just isn't done that way. So Second option would be to use A n pt. This has all the well known baggage that goes along with A. You know, not being able to change the preference in your in your clients and some clients and, you know, being preference below Ip v four. With the implementation of N t, you know, this actually works with an Ip six only environment, but again, when you put before in there, You know things fall apart quickly. And final option Next slide, please? Plus Matt, Obviously, this is the least desirable of all of them because it breaks things that we don't wanna break. But it is actually deployed in the wild and you know, so it should probably be noted that it is actually something that's doable. Next slide. So we laid out a map with the solution considerations and just sort of put it out there for for people to to use Next slide, So this is the this is really the the most important one that, you know, the Id has a lot of operational issues to work out and multi homing when you don't have I... You know, Pi address space in an As is is sort of an elephant in the room because that's a very large percentage of deployments.

That I have, you know, the ability to pick, you know, which part of the net I wanna enter based on address selection, right? Positive things. Right?

Lorenzo. I mean, I think it's worth noting that I think far as I can tell Pt experimental, and that's not recommended. So for a like from an Perspective, the And and, like, private address solutions aren't really something that we can endorse. Right? Because they're experimental or app actively discouraged. So, yeah. I mean, we know that multi prefix multi earning is hard, but we need to, like, somehow make progress on that problem with global space.

So So we propose an Ib v six only capable either a way to resolve.

So it applies the pair sixty four to the Ip four address and construct an Ibm converted Ip v six address as defined in sixty fifty two. So this way, the resolve can an Ip six packet, and it will be routed to the nas Table and then we can connect to the ortho bit of so. Next slide, please. So why we want to do this?

Is that we think that there's a lot of people as a services and having an Ib as a service solution may great, but some people are using Diana six four not sixty four.
