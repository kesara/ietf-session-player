    "text": "okay well this is not long I mean this where this could turn into a very long conversation but I don\u0027t think it needs to I just want to sort of point out that we ain\u0027t done yet so basically when I was sitting down working on the home net naming architecture presentation it occurred to me that there\u0027s actually a fair amount of stuff that we haven\u0027t done yet that is still on my mental to-do list which doesn\u0027t mean that we have to do it of course but it is on my mental to-do list and so I figured that I would share my mental to-do list with you all so that you know you can laugh and throw tomatoes so I don\u0027t think that we actually have a complete home net specification yet and I think that even when we\u0027re done with a simple home that naming architecture we will still have more work to do I don\u0027t think that if you were to just ask some random router vendor to go implement HomeNet right now that they would succeed so one of the things that I think is missing is something that\u0027s like the home net naming or sorry like the the whole net architecture but with explicit details about how to put the whole thing together I don\u0027t think we have that I don\u0027t think that the home that architecture is that so that\u0027s something it needs to happen and then you know sort of a subsidiary bit of that is that we need some stuff about how h n CP does the various things that need to be done not just the things that the h n CP spec does but the other things we\u0027ve come up with since then and also how we operate home net naming so I don\u0027t know if we need I think that the SNC know the symbol on that naming architecture could be the home net naming architecture ops document I think that if we if we succeed in doing the things that I laid out in the previous presentation that that will actually have that but but we need to we need to have explicit instructions on how to set all this stuff up or else and it needs to be something that somebody who\u0027s not an ITF person would be able to use to produce a home net router that would successfully connect to someone else\u0027s home net router and work right so I think that there are some more technical things which I\u0027ll discuss in later slides and also I think that we need to go through come through the home net architecture and make sure that we haven\u0027t missed anything because I actually haven\u0027t done that recently I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve looked at the home net architecture itself in at least a year so it\u0027s quite possible that there are things that we have forgotten about in there the we need to either talk about it or decide we don\u0027t we\u0027re not doing so technical topics we could discover it could discuss in no particular order and in no particular degree of importance the DNS SEC on the home that thing that I was just talking about that\u0027s that line item hung that identifier which is probably just DNS SEC on the home net "

    "text": "in the hn c hn CP spec that if your if your ipv4 uplink goes away you d configure IP on all internal interfaces and so i think the reasoning for that is that you wanted to avoid having devices try to use ipv4 when it\u0027s not working and in principle if you have ipv6 working on your home net and you\u0027re not using ipv4 for connecting for intra HomeNet connections that should be okay but if that\u0027s the way we want to solve that problem that we need to be a lot more explicit about that than we are right now because right now my experience when I first started using hn CP was that i was happily using my network and i did something and about ten minutes later my whole network just stopped working because i didn\u0027t actually have ipv4 working our IP v6 working on on on the whole routed network at that time and so when my ipv4 uplink went away I just couldn\u0027t use my network anymore this is this is not desirable very least unreachable yeah I mean do you think that\u0027s really a problem at this point I mean you you have happy eyeballs running on most things at this point and so in principle if you have working ipv4 and non-working ipv6 you should just wind up with an ipv4 connection and vice versa so I mean what you just said actually applies equally and is the motivation behind the specification hn CP that if ipv4 isn\u0027t available you drop my the ipv4 because you don\u0027t want people picking ipv4 and not being able to get off the network well so the reasoning was that in fact ipv6 would always be working because you know that is this is the future and ipv4 might not be working okay no you\u0027re actually in the future I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve noticed it\u0027s just that it\u0027s not quite the future we expected and it\u0027s also kind of unevenly distributed yeah sorry so anyway is that it that\u0027s all I got okay so I think we the chairs have an action item to set up some doodle polls and things like that for people who want to do the bi-weekly meetings with I\u0027m Ted to try and get this to a real implementable state did we have other "
