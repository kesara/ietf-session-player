    "text": "right so I think that is a very good priority at this point in time and only when we see that certain aspects um cannot uh be improved uh in in in energy consumption um at that point in time we have a different discussion about you know dealing with with upper limits and reducing them um which I think we have right now with CPU and data centers and all that stuff um so to to get back to what you know an old colleague from me called www.show meth money.com I think um the problem really is that we may be missing some some more explanation of use cases on how um you know Network operators vendors and others could monetize uh these type of things right there may be few lead companies that understand it but I think prolifera proliferating the ideas for that would be very helpful for example um I think right now it would be helpful to have you know the the energy consumption of the different components in router available offline so not only Yang or something because in the first place you need some planning department to figure out if we would operationalize these power savings how much power would we save in the network and then go back to Executives and say hey um we could save you know this amount of power so you could translate that to More Energy Efficiency that you reach year overy year by improving you know that uh Dynamic power consumption in the network that's something you can give to stakeholders to policy holders tell us if it's worth it right so that's the starting point right so just offline somewhere in paperwork for planning departments to do this this type of planning and then when actually Executives comes back and says oh yeah that's a great idea then we need to be prepared and that goes back to my first comment on the reliability make sure that uh all the operators feel safe to actually do operational changes um in the in in in these components in the"
