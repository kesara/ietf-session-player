I spent last week in Hokkaido where there was no blossom, no leaves, just snow. But as we came and south south, So the the blossom was was coming out. Another little essential this story is to know that in Japanese culture, the Cara that the the crow or raven is it symbolizes love and gratitude and good luck. And in fact in the ancient Japanese Shinto religion, the ravens were believed to be messengers of the gods. And you see them if you if you look at classical Japanese, you see because of of Ravens or crow going back a long long way. So I I took those two things. And blended them with a very old western fairy tale or folk story called snow white and blood red.

We've got the snow and in the blood, suddenly hair is black is ebony anyway. That leads onto to the whole snow story. So we have snow white and cherry blossom pink. There was once a princess in the Ka area of Japan She lived in a beautiful tower of wood that was carved and painted with the most delicate colors. On the ridges of the red Tiled roof, stood dragons and Og whose job it was to ward off the evil spirits and keep the princess safe. In the Walled garden, there were many useful herbs well as flowering plants and of course, an old and much loved cherry tree The Princess wanted for nothing. She had everything that her loving husband could provide for her and the people of the surrounding countryside were always passing by. With gifts of fruit. Or some birds For the Princess was much loved for her grace and beauty. As well as for her kindness and happy smile. Except the princess dearly wanted a child."

Only sometimes which you grow west and stand at a window in the high tower looking out at the distant c, or at the phone of Hills and saw him for the child she did not have. One springtime, the Cherry tree put on a show of blossom more spectacular than anyone could remember. The clumps of pink flowers tuned with red and white stood out against a clear blue sky. The princess delight in the bright colors asked for a few small branches to be brought to her room. And there they enhance the decorations bringing a smile to everyone's face. But it was a strange year almost as soon as the old tree had flour, there was the heaviest of frost. The cold weather cut through everything setting ice on the horse's drinking trough and making the servants rush to light the black iron stove in the rooms in the tower. The wind blue sharp and spite out of the north and the tree gave up its blossoms to the gale. That night, the snow started to fall. And by the next morning, deep drift had built up in the garden.
