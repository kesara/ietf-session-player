    "text": "100 websites that give out quad-a entries in DNS and we saw that 27 percent of these websites have some partial failure then fetching content over v6 and so what are these 27 websites so now look at the table so these are the 27 websites that have some partial failure over v6 they do not failover before but only or v6 and so the column will show you what percentage of failure you see or six and I highlighted some of the websites in red which I consider popular but this is just from my own vantage point so it might be different story for different people and if you look at the top of the horizontal line you will see that nine percent of the websites have more than 50 percent failure or v6 so half of the content you don\u0027t get if you are sitting in a v6 only network with no translation yeah six percent of the website completely fail way which we already talked about and if you look at the last column you will see that the ticks are on websites which participated on the world ipv6 launch day and again promised to turn on v6 for their services so the takeaway here from this slide is that if any metrics that is limiting observation to the root webpage like index dot HTML will always give an overestimation of v6 adoption numbers because you are actually not looking at the content of the website and at this point I am again wondering whether websites which have partial failure or we say can they be deemed ipv6 ready candy and so in order to support this effort I sock is actually not supporting development of tools where you can go to a site and into such some a URL and tells you what fraction of failure do you see you in fetching content over v6 ok we also did some root cause analysis of why do you see partial failure happening or for for these 27% websites and this is largely happening because some of the content is just not having coordinator ease in DNS for the website so so there is failure to DNS resolution for body increase and this is largely happening for images JavaScript JSON and CSS so think about it if there is a website that fails to load the CSS over v6 only with our translation how would it look on a v6 only network without translation and so and so again so failures these failures tend to silently exist because clients do not notice them because the v4 fall back and again so identification of these operational Network issues are irrelevant for upcoming v6 only Network because at some point in time you might want to remove that nat64 translation okay be a bit further root cause analysis trying to see where is this failure actually coming from so we saw that the failure is actually coming from both same origin cross origin sources so "
