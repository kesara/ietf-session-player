And, actually, the document contains a in greater detail a lot of those things of interest of time. go to the next slide, please. second aspect concerns in network as a whole, is this customer the bulk, I guess, of the of successively challenges lie here. Basically, networks can be optimized for a number of things and, basically, in the context of sustainability in green basically, network optimization extends to that. How can you basically make a solution aware and essentially optimize on the various green in sustainability type of parameters, Now, of course, all kinds of research topics associated with this. You can apply AI and machine learning methods we have. applicability of game theoretic approaches, And and support. So you see run down some of the topics here. Again, details referred to the draft. Next one. At the protocol level, it is not part of particular interest for work that we want to potentially transition to the IETF. is basically what would be some of the protocol enablers for network for some of the new network energy saving mechanisms for instance, a lot of the special concerns points and energy proportionality. and taking funds. Resources offline or online and support, busy to enable these things, we would require mechanism for first discovery, let's say 3 convergence and so forth.

And then finally, basically, at the architecture level is basically how you would you take it instead take an even higher level, basically, and look at how how would you actually organize networking applications? taking into account not just the network itself, but also ask it such as where would you place your computation placement, solve value, things such as, yeah, called the delivery network, from an energy perspective, some of the topics that are being discussed in coin and support would fit into put into fit into this area. Next, So, well, regarding the documents yeah. So, yeah, we we are rewriting the document. There are have are few comments which have been received, which still need to incorporate. also would like to solicit that more comments, of course, On the on the document, We would also want to mention that, basically, there's a companion graph in AWG concerning green metrics. is he addressing the issurmentation side of things. next month. Next month. And then regarding the topic on feedback on Venus Energy topic, which was one of the items which were asked on the mailing list I what is well, the question, what types of further contributions could we work on an MRB, and I believe actually there are many topics, many topics where you can also see about fax also publication or in, like, triple e type of journals and so forth. I think in terms of here, this would be work that is looks closer again to to where it can be transitioned eventually to to interoperability protocol things about of the items that come to mind are carbon telemetry."

I will be, for instance, snapshots, carbon telemetry along the path, I would recollect that this would be basically, you know, something like, question, how can we 7 and build on the existing mechanisms that we have and perhaps improve them. Second as the concerns, again, the that recovered optimization is a use case for AI that will also allow us to tie the 2 subjects together because AI is another big topic complex that we have here in an MLP, This controls everything from optimizing paths to optimizing function placements, etcetera. Then the third one concerns, basically, what what mechanism would help some of the schemes that energy saving mechanism would need. So, again, this is the aspect would be, for instance, should we retain certain states to facilitate fast rediscover and recon reconversion as we take resources offline, bringing them back and those sorts of things. And then finally, And also, we'll we have a copy on intent based networking. So clearly one could also imagine are going to be some control nodes that would allow users or network operators to to navigate the trade offs that they would potentially have to make between yeah, between sustainability in one hand and other purposes in the networks such as utilization and support And I think this concludes what happened.

So with this presentation, both. with all these paths around the AI managing data is more important than ever.

First, there's data fabric, data Arabic defines an architecture for data infrastructures. the basic ideas that with this architecture, you are unifying all the data that you have. So the data fabric boot collect data from heterogeneousources and integrate it So this can be All this data can be exposed to our unified interface. No? And then there's the damage. I I think you're all very familiar with the damage. So yes, to to remind you that It's more an organizational approach, a new way of managing your your data in an organization. based on 4 principles, the the basic ideas that the owners of of the data sources are responsible for making this data useable, findable, and and trusted for for the consumers. And we see these 2 paradigms complementary. could use the data fabric the infrastructure that owners of the data can use to build this data product. and assure them. Next slide, please. So with these 2 paradigms, what we see now is this not so new technology, which is the knowledge graph. in putting it simple analytics graph, it's basically the representation of concepts related to other concepts in a graph. Okay. And and for this, the the idea of knowledge graph is to leverage all this work done methodologies, taxonomies that have been there since the the advent of of the semantic web. and the precisely the idea is to combine all this knowledge with data instances."

No? precisely, this is the standard way that we are using afford implementation of an ELECTRA. So why knowledge graphs are becoming important again? because they are considered enablers of the the Safari paradigm. And this is because they enable this integration graphs our flexible structure that allows to to accommodate any kind of any kind of data because at the end, what we want to do is to connect data from different sources. That's that's the whole that's the goal of of all of this. No? And, precisely, this data integration is possible through a semantic layer based on the on this knowledge. with with with ontology. No? So the the the work that we that we are are doing is to see well, to identify these data sources and see how can we transform this raw data, for example, yang, into into its conceptual representation. and this is what is known as as semantic lifting. And the proposal that we're doing for for for to align this work with the damages that additional product could be this concept for representation of the data. Yes. data probably is something that we still need to to be clarified. So this is the the approach that we are following so so far. Next slide, please."

So what we are doing is we are defining some rules, some mapping rules, that map the the data that we have modeling in Yen. to entities, properties and relationships with with other entities now. So here we are already facing some challenges. we see that, for example, we have different young data models frame 2. same concepts. Also, we see in the in the same young model we see different parts of the of the model referring to same concepts. UCT is, for example, in the general library. where the concept of our module is refer multiple times in different ways. an implemented module or an important module, but the concept is the same. So essentially, these are the the challenges that we are facing. and we were planning to to have an implementation of this and hopefully show something in the upcoming second time or or into high conference, we'll see.

We see after is that knowledge traps, to to our in our in our view is the they are key tone looking AI. because they they facilitate the same progression.

There's also IT fix. PGP, netflow and so on. So we need to to take this account when when it's a rating data. Another point is that We believe that the network industry should start looking at ontologies. We think that in the network industries be behind compared to other industries like automotive, finance or health where they are already standard authorities. They are using them.

If I understood correctly here, you wanna take everything that's already done. transform it to some ontology and redefine things again most certainly. Yeah. This is a huge effort. This is basically redefining everything we have done before, and I here. Also, on production, from practical point of view, this is huge undertaking. And, you know, the more transformations you add to the data, the the model chances for something to happen that will break and, you know, that It's very hard to build trust around the data you produce. you wanna reduce the amount of errors because if your ontology say there is something wrong with your network, you want that to be network is actually the wrong mouse version kind of pipeline. this is my first comment"

We get d 2 to not evolving now. It's a long project. But I would rather to have the schematics in prod to yang So we can run ontologies on top of it. something close to it, maybe not 100%. But rather than transforming the data, we can probably inertial data that we have, and we start working on it. Just an alternate approach. Thank you. Thank you. Alex. Yeah. So maybe also a little bit run the lines of the previous comment. The ontology scares me also a little bit. I think of SID and CIMCX and so forth. I'm not sure if this is the right way that we want to go down on this slippery slope.

We need to to be able to reasonable data and and to connect the many different models that we have we need to do so.

That said, we have also an issue that we can also try to concentrate our efforts in together. So Okay to explore different path, but from a research group in terms of progress. At some point, we need also to try to to move the community forward. Yes. Mhmm. Thank you. Thank you. you. Thank you very much. Thank"

But, of course, we received also a set of additional comments during the discussion. So here, you you see a full list. I mean, not enter too much into the detail. But but but you have a lot of we have a lot of discussion and the on 2 things. Although, one was regarding the quality of the that you are using. that you need from mockolitatidata but you are for AI, but not only for AI. So proviser is somewhere to explore in this area as well. or to evaluate the quality of data or to collect more quality data from the beginning means that example, if you know your what you would do with data, maybe you can correct Data that are most suitable from the beginning. Also, there was a lot of discussion it was quite a recurrent topic as well on dataset availability of dataset. So from a research perspective, it's important to a dataset to organs. There's also some discussion. So Here we saw some, let's say, a propositions, not only specific to NVIDIA. So we should maybe combined with other communities. There was some opposition to not goal is not no. Our goal is not really to provide that asset, but at least maybe maintain a catalog of datasets on whatever expanding some some imitation of some existing data sets. Listen to us.

If you want to know to go more with to make some connection with consistomalization path ever since we just seen as well. can also marginal value depends on on the and Mike on the data management part if you want. So there is any comment on that. but we can move to next day. So thank you along. So then we have also the topic of artificial intelligence. So here, if I can summarize the commands that we receive that we have So we have the first So a good document. that is, you know, that is quite stable. the idea that we have that we received is no maybe took some to take some challenges from this document and work on these challenges Of course, if you want to work in challenges, Globally on a challenge, you need also some use case So that's why the idea of the material. So you have different topics that I've been proposed on the challenge that we have already challenges like such we have already, let's say, documented generally like the problem of the distributed AI. some prongerated explainability and so on and so on. And although there are some suggestion regarding deployment and implementation when using yeah. Also, like, before you use that asset, you can provide some lessons learned when you use some maybe AI tools, AI processing pipeline, you can also share the lessons learned. from the density. Okay.

Some some of this seems quite similar to the previous topic. So, you know, it it would be good to make sure we understand the differences. if if there are fundamental differences or if this is one topic. I think should be brought together, and and we should be trying to find connections. Yeah. Yeah. I personally agree Traleasy, let's say, the we haven't say, I to p before, we have already the data, let's say, management part. it seems that the discussion, it goes a bit beyond. So maybe I think it's your point is really relevant. We have to see exactly what does the exact difference was the commonities to it's a little bit even, of course, read some interaction that could be 20 So general remarks. So, again, this is what we received the feedback from the participants. So people say in the margin should continue because the question was asked, in my in my question when I sent it, at people also, in addition to the topic we are addressing in the other things around by the group, to have an energy as an open forum, and they want to share your your ideas. So it's already appreciated that. Most of them, most of the participant who who concern, say we should also reinforce connection with with other We sell group, working group, and SDUs.

And it's a good tool to transition, for example, to working.

And although technical presentation has for this car. Familiar is an energy as we are doing a regularity already.

Fi traffic in the group. Next slide. Yes, Quinn. You want to try something? Yeah. Colin Perkins. So, I mean, just on the the topic of Drift, versus a other ways of publishing. know, I mean, drafts are a perfectly reasonable way of organizing what and and, you know, lots of research groups do publish RFCs. Equally, the the focus should be on research and research should be over publishable quality. So you know, what what well, the deaf drafts and and I have is a useful kit, consider also whether the focus should be on papers and published outputs. you know,"

So this maybe the the the slides Just if you allow me, Jean, because we we have also some comments, let's say, on the chat. So I'm just relating what Dan was conveying in the chat of the media code that is a bit confused about how we use the the term AI in the group. whether when we use when we say AI, we refer to machine learning or let me quote. Still unclear how we use AI here, is it what just to say -- I'm here. Okay. Yeah. I I wasn't better long. don't wanna distract with derail the thing. I'm confused when we mentioned AI versus machine learning. in the context of network management, I think we refer to machine learning. instead of AI, but is it Am I at the right place saying that? Yeah. Okay. Well, I think they're not mutually inclusive as well. somewhat computer science. We we are to to be honest, personally, I think we are talking a lot about machine learning, but It's not the only AI. And, no, actually, this is the goal of this meeting and the follow-up because it's It's not the the end of discussion. will be preceded to define what you want to do with AI. in our research group. and and maybe it will restrict to machine learning, but at that time. I will not, let's say, restrict to to any particular 0, no time to push it. Both time developers, in particular, now now that you mentioned this, I I remember there is a there is a draft"

And in some cases, Juno, in some cases, when we're talking about capturing expert knowledge, etcetera, something that's has been used in the past. and it might read them in some cases, it could make sense. just As a note, I mean, I would use the word AI, and that in my view include machine learning and not necessarily is it's it's limited to machine learning. Is it fair to say if we're talking about open loop or learning and predict something. is more Mashion Learning. And if we're taking an action 3, is more AI. So if we distinguish these 2, because I'm coming from the AI side. Now I can follow the thread. Alright. Look. Alright. for AI, I'd like to keep it open AI because in in what the best they are to use here is also part of the research, I guess. and to echo Colin a bit and this is, like, more of a general remark from other from the 2 anomalies in the side meeting. it seemed that the format that we are having here is more valid to this customer research ideas, interpreting them, it doesn't have the same rigorous format of a workshop or conference where you actually have to bring data, prove your method works. it's fine. It's okay. It's acceptable, but, you know, it just put for the phone. And and not sure if you wanna make it more rigorous. I think it's good to have it open"

So maybe let's move on to the to the to this go back to the site. So here are more the chair view now after we analyze a bit the view of the discussion that we had in the design meeting in the email, So those are the things Thanks a lot for the inputs because we received a lot of constructive inputs. It was very nice specifications that we had. So you propose a lot of things at some time it says that we have to keep focused. So so it's a bit antagonist. Yeah. But also as share, we we have to say that we need to define priorities. We cannot cannot tackle all what has been what what has been proposed. Of course, This is the idea of the is it today's meeting with the source of the next let's say, interim meeting and discussions that we have. ready to define the spreadsheets, but keep And energy is always in the open forum with our new ideas. Next slide, please. Okay. So in terms of type of contribution, I think it's It was already a bit, let's say, between different meetings and discussion We are not specifically focused on that. We are not specifically focused on presentation. The old types of contribution, Fine. It's not the same effort to edit. So Yes.

Yes. It's if there is this possibility, but it's not mandatory. because we are research robots If at some point somebody identified some somebody has proposed something that could lead to Santander. Okay. That's good. but it's not mandatory. Of course, we are really relying also on new implication not only in the IT, but also in other organization communities. because we need also the help of participant to make the difference, let's say, connection with so and so. Okay. So Yeah. Yeah. She's next slide very long. So regarding the different topics, so I will not go back and network that wind towards the goal of the other session, geosatopics. So first, on green networking, as in our views, it's not really what will be our yet. So we will run into a meeting to maybe find a possible agenda if you are able to find it. Also, It's important that the participant commit dictates an effort. But, Ruzu, it has to be done in the context of the IAB program. So we have to be as with the IAB program too. have something current within the with, you know, the the ETF, and also also we start Regarding IBM, okay. We receive a lot of inputs again. So people seems to want to continue to work in IBM But we do not receive so far so many contributions the last, let's say, meetings.

We got the IBM by the IPF 119. we'll suppose that IBM is handed IBM topic is ended in the energy energy Regarding AI, I think what has been highlighted is that, no, we have the challenge documents. So now we can focus on some specific change. Of course, think it's a bit related to what I did say before. we can explore. different things, but It's be good as a research to have a focused effort of some challenges. So if we have result, We plan on an engineering meeting to redefine the challenges that as an equality for would like to take a that Yeah. Okay.

And you also identify because we have topics between people to work on topics. think we do the best time for you to discuss. Already over time, but we can continue session after and maybe, Colin, you have some word of confusion you want to share. Yeah. Hi, Colin Perkins. Can you hear me? Yeah. So Yeah. First of all, This has been a really good exercise. I'm I'm actually really impressed by the amount of discussion and feedback you got here and the the amount of energy this shows still being in the group with which has been running for for a very long time now. So I think that that that's really impressive. I I like the focus on research questions. and clearly identifying that the the research to be done on all of the items. I I think that's good, and and we'll make sure that this the the group stays as a research group and doesn't drift into doing standards by another name. I think, you know, I think as as we discussed with the, you know, myself and the chairs over over lunch, there's a there's a lot of good stuff here, but but the scope is maybe getting a bit broad. And I I would encourage you to think about which items are giving to be done. and make sure that they're they're done and the work gets concluded finished. and the the group scope doesn't keep continually expanding. you know, make make make sure the work actually concludes and achieves its goal"
