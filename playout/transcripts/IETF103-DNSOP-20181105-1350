    "text": "manner from the authorities there are two other interesting changes that are coming along with this though one of them is that I just happen to notice recently that RFC 2181 actually says that in the year 32-bit TTL field if the high-order bit is set that is somebody has treated it as an unsigned integer when really that high order bit is undefined that you should treat it as though the TTL was set to zero that doesn\u0027t seem like a particularly good idea particularly given some of the past badness FS revolve revolved around having a TTL of zero and so in this draft of what I have suggested is that really we should perhaps just treat as though the high order bit is not set and it was just the either Capet at the max or well right at the moment it says to treat it as the max but in it so observing that means that you have a potential TTL of 68 years which also is a pretty terrible idea in a lot of different ways and it\u0027s noted that most resolvers at least that we\u0027re familiar with all having Maxim\u0027s already associated with them bind I believe it\u0027s default is at maximum week not I thinks is a day and so it seems pretty reasonable that we suggest should should suggest that we that there is kind of a make a recommendation rather than you must cap DT L suggest that you use a default cap of some value like a week and so we\u0027d like some feedback on that whether in fact it is also kind of supportive that there\u0027d be a recommended cap on TTLs there are two different options in the current version of the draft one it\u0027s as I previously noted the idea is that the features that this feature of being able to use stale data is not really meant to be it\u0027s it\u0027s essentially opt out which the ITF has made some statements that quite understandably that that feature should be opt in where possible but in this particular case the feature is really intended to add resiliency to the existing deployment or not and so this the easiness options are proposed not to say whether or not still data is okay but to say explicitly hey I know about the possibility of still data I\u0027d like to know whether any of the data in my answer was stale or not still where clients could also then use this to ignore it if they really didn\u0027t want stale data it should be noted that you can actually like with the implementation I did for bind that because stale data is predicated on a resolution timeout that if you asked for non recursion you should also then not get back stale answers the problem with "

    "text": "solicit comments for this work and if there is some interest we would like to get this work adopted as a working group item thank you any interest in the group here maybe people know in companies organizations that are interested in deploying young so this is on red I see I didn\u0027t get one thing from the from the draft who will be doing this update so if I\u0027m writing draft if you preserve the core type after this is in effect will it be my responsibility to edit like to Diana section or Ayana will do this automatically so it will be more evolved for Ayane or like I think this is explained in the Ayane consideration section and we have a good example of a similar registry mainly Ayane interface types this document has been its RFC I don\u0027t know the number but it\u0027s the idea is that IANA will maintain this module so this module will never be updated manually and after an entry is added to the registry IANA will be responsible for updating the module in the way that\u0027s indicated in the eye on our consideration sections so it means adding a new enum for away all the power so it doesn\u0027t affect the DNS of pork at all no no only this is as I said this is only an initial revision of this module so this will be submitted it could become an RFC later and then IANA will take over the maintenance of this in fara and yeah just a general vote to support the work I mean we as torture Telecom are very interested in this and will be using it when it arrives and how to be able to contribute to it as well okay thank you Wes her degree I say I think this is definitely a good thing to go forward and and you know the more we have structs and enums available to us the more likely code will get written that being said there have been other implementations in the past both in and and other management protocols that failed to get off the ground so it\u0027s great that you got work done in the hackathon I will point out RFC 61 68 which is a management considerations for DNR what it stands for I remember the title but basically it\u0027s a group of you know 20 25 people that sat around in the room and tried to discuss requirements for what it takes to manage DNS software and that may be worth looking into okay thank you so I would suggest to collect more feedback from the working group make another iteration of the other mailing list indeed make another iteration of the document and continue thank you we\u0027re good in time "
