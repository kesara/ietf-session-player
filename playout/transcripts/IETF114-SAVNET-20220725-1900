    "text": "said that could let you handle this kind of cases go ahead jared yeah jared mocha akamai so um similar similar to my question for igor earlier a lot of cases we see a route summarization of a of an aggregate route like a slash 24 or something where we go and we roll something up either in an igp or an egp like bgp where we'll go and we'll have a slash 24 and a bunch of you know 31's 32s or something that may live within there uh and they end up in either different areas or something like that how are we going to do this without going you know because this is done to prevent the the cpu scale of the router from being blown out by carrying all of the state by creating the summarization you know to some extent jeff's shaking his head but um you know to go and create some amount of summarization where uh some information gets rolled up and aggregated how are we going to do this you know without going in creating the exact same problem that we're trying to prevent in limiting the routing domain like how is this protocol going to scale differently if it's designed than any of the other existing routing protocols that we've built so far do we have an idea do you have an idea yes then you asked it but there is a very important question in there if you have to get this remote information and it is aggregated but the aggregate is not going to be accurate so you have to disaggregate did you just blow your whole scaling system up and that's an important question to figure out if any of these approaches will yeah and this and this is what operators face on a daily basis because we're left with devices that have limited hardware space to program filters or limited uh hardware space that actually will take forwarding table entries on which to do something like a rpf check or similar yan sing you wanted to comment uh okay uh okay comments will i have received"
