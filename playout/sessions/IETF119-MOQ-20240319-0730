The sending rate is controlled by measurement of the capacity using the CC algorithm. By nature, this is a control loop with delay, because it takes some time for CC to detect the changes in network condition. So we have all the classic issue of control loop with delay. The first priority is to reduce the delay as much as we can, and then to do something efficient if the previous decisions were wrong.</p>",

The receiver is in the best place to observe receive_rate, which is ground truth as to what the receiver can get. That said, the sender is in the best place to know what it sent, which makes it the right side to know how to filter any measurements it makes of the network. On either side, you have to compensate for something. That said, the sender has to make decisions about what to send and when to send (consider pacing, for instance), so it has to have intelligence to figure that out. The client can help, but the sender is the one acting. This applies to any kind of congestion response, including scheduling and priorities.</p>",
