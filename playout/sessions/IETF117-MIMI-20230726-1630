MLS is agnostic to the identity system used within any given messaging service; it provides confidentiality of sessions once the participants in a conversation have been identified. To achieve interoperable messaging, the MIMI working group will specify how one or more identity building block technologies (for example, X.509 certificates or Verifiable Credentials) can be used to establish end-to-end cryptographic identity across messaging services, assuming the use of MLS for key establishment.</p>\n<p>Interoperable messaging in federated environments requires consensus on a common delivery service and a transport protocol between federated domains. Specifically, the MLS protocol requires ordering of handshake messages within groups to ensure clients can synchronize despite asynchronous message delivery. This working group will specify a flexible solution for transport and delivery that takes into account typical requirements and best practices from the industry.</p>",

Building something for the first six months of deployment when it will stick around forever has turned out to be a bad idea many times (Hello, \"Host\" header).   Speaking personally, I think it is more compelling to offer a single transition than a set of stages.  I rather suspect that if I called up the relevant teams at Google or Meta and said \"how many transitions do you want here\" the answer would be \"ideally, zero\".  Offering them two, rather than one, does not sound like a win, especially given the complexity of any of the transitions in maintaining the appropriate security and privacy characteristics.</p>",
