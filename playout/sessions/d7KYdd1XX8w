In eBPF, that is what we do, i.e., extract the serviceID from the EH, do the hash based lookup to determine the next hop (possibly doing a secondary step to select one of possibly more next hops) and forward. This is fast (100ks of requests per second), even in eBPF. Also, the load is smaller since the SAR only processes the local client load, rather than needing to resolve all clients of a domain.</p>",

In a manner, the SAR is the mapping service, particularly in the scheduled mode where indeed one of possibly several service instance IPs is chosen, based on some possibly service-specific selection mechanism.

Currently, we are using IPv6 packets and link-local addresses for communicating between KIRA routing instances. So a router would always have to implement KIRA for its control plane. Using this connectivity, you could simply use ssh netconf or whatever to connect to the router in order to configure it, e.g., its data plane routing like OSPF or BGP.</p>",
