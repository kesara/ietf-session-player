Yes, a NAT rebinding can result in a path change due to ECMP routing, but it is likely not something the peer can reliably discern. A NAT-rebinding would only result in a change of the source port as seen from the perspective of the peer to the one being NATed. Thus, one can't determine if this is a path change due to further routing in the network, or if it has made no different to the actual path other then how the NAT binding looks.</p>",
