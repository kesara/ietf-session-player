Assuming that 50% of open solvers have a two-day lifespan (slide 13), there must be a huge influx of new open solvers installed and misconfigured. As far as I know, the open source resolvers (the source files) are distributed with secure default options. It might be interesting to investigate further what exactly is going on. The almost 10 million open solvers of which 90+% come and go seems very high and we have to look at how we can prevent that.</p>",
