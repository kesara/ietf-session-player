      "text": "Regarding Gorry's question, my 2 cents: patterns of changing capacities at the link layer may introduce more complexity to the whole system... but to simplify this a little bit: all SBD detection algorithms essentially look at correlations in the behavior of flows. When correlations are detected, a shared bottleneck is identified. E.g., a fluctuating-capacity link may temporarily introduce correlations, when the capacity is small - then the issue is the detection reliability and speed.<br/>"

The correlation methods will also correlate on those fluctuations and not the BN in that scenario as well.<br/>"
