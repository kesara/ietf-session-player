This is _legal_, and _cleared by the courts_, but remains unethical.</p>\n<p>Hence, I am still not convinced that utilizing the current political situation in a country is a viable metric for assessing the state of digital freedom; Instead, i'd argue, a perspective on available and deployed technical infrastructure, especially given that it is robust against noise introduced by positionality of assessors.</p>",

Since the entire purpose is to broadcast your personal data, you provide them with explicit authorisation to process your personal data. I don't think that's opaque at all. However, I think that users may not quite grasp that all that personal informaiton is there to profile you and manipulate you.Advertising is an attempt to influence you to spend money in a particular way or vote for a particular person in the case of campaign ads, so I think it's reasonable to just make a blanket statement that the purpose is manipulation.</p>",
