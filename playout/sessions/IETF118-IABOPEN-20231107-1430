    "text": "<p>@Nick: First, try to move away from vocabulary like \"secret\" -- it betrays a bias and makes a cooperative relationship more difficult.  ISO has two main motivations in those rules.  One is, as Peter mentioned, that they draw a non-trivial portion of their support from sale of standards.  The other is tied to a problem the IETF has tried to solve in an entirely different way.  That is to discourage people from going off and implementing half (or less) -baked ideas, deploying  those implementations widely, and then claiming the final standard has to be constrained by those implementations and/or complaining when it it is different from whatever they did.   Our approach historically relied on three (and then two) maturity levels -- IIR, my very first task when I became an AD, assigned by the IETF Chair, was to explain to a large corporation that their implementing and deploying an  unpublished Proposed Standard was not a great idea and consequences of changes were was their problem, not the IETF's -- and on the distinction between Internet-Drafts and RFCs.   Things have changed, but I'd claim that neither has worked very well.  ISO's version is to treat  working documents and input on them as restricted to those actively participating in the work. ... More sometime, before they shut the chat down....</p>",
