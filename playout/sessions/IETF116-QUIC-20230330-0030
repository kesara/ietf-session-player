A better way to explain this is that, unless you have absolutely perfect pacing of data and ACKS, half the RTTs will exhibit &lt;1 ACK and the other half &gt;1 ACK, that’s a performance impact, because you'll be stalling half the time. Changing the ACK frequency does impact the CC behaviour:  I am worried this  can synchronise congestion in the return direction to the pattern of transmission in the forward direction, and strong CC synchronisation is worrying.</p>",
