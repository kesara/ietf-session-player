The comment that I had was that for me at least it would also be useful to discuss how applications can trust the edge and COIN systems, and what mechanisms might be needed to support/enforce that trust. It could of course be that such discussion is in some other document... Anyway, the situation seems like a two-way street in many ways: what do we need in the devices and the network and compute elements to achieve a particular goal?<br/>"
