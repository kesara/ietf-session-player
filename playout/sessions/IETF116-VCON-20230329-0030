By access logs, we refer to information about who accessed the recording, when they accessed it, and for what purposed it was accessed. Examples of \"purposes\" include - listening to a recording for purposes of quality assurance for a contact center call, or transcription of a recording to generate a text transcript.</p>",

Today, it is common for vendors of contact center software, to send call recordings to third party services for the purposes of \"quality management\". In quality management, a human listens to the recording and rates the performance of the contact center agent. Today, the exchange of these recordings between vendors is done through raw audio files, with meta-data (such as time of the call and identity of the agent) exchanged out of bands. The goal with VCON is to enable a standardized exchange format between these vendors.</p>",
