I think key thing is that the document is describing the combination of elements already defined in IETF, or newly defined (i.e new PCEP extensions), in an information track document so that the terminology can be consistent, and the combination of these building blocks can be well-known, which would allow the new extensions to have a backing use case description.</p>\n<p>@Jie - could you expand a bit more? Do you mean, for example, a statement describing something such as the PCE may leverage mechanisms such as GRPC to do bandwidth tracking? </p>\n<p>@Dhruv - Yes, current focus is PCEP. In theory, some concepts of CS-SR Policy could be deployed via BGP, but main focus is to use the foundation already supported and defined in PCEP.</p>",
