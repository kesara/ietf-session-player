E.g. AttestAttribute ::= ATTRIBUTE { AttestStructure IDENTIFIED BY id-attestStructure-oid} maps directly as AttestExtension ::= EXTENSION { SYNTAX AttestStructure IDENTIFIED BY id-AttestStructure-oid }.  So I’d not the need and defer the definition until the structure definition is stable.   If you want the extension to contain different info than the extension, then you’ll need to define a different structure and get a different oid.  One of the reasons I keep arguing against including the certificates in the structure is the possible use of the structure as an extension for the other pkix related protocols.</p>",
