Formal methods blackbox components as \"perfect\" but are able to look at interleaving attacks well as exhaustive search. Computational analysis is able to get into details and algorithms, such as key indistinguishability under a given PSK combination but is harder for exhaustive search. So these show very different things. The academic community does not want to step on each other's toes so will often hold off from recommending one versus another, but what each analysis will show and bring to light is not a mystery.</p>",
