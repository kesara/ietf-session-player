    "text": "<p>@ John suggestion, that seems fair. I agree highlighting which sections are normative vs informative is a good idea, but I'm still leaning towards having it enclosed in one \"big\" document since it does cover various content that does inter-twine a bit. Of course, if we can isolate them in a single document then it means it's feasible to split the document, but it would be nice to point to one document that says here's \"the\" document that clarifies the current state of operational concerns, as its a combination of normative and informative</p>",
