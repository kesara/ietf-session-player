We have the technology to do that, but the threat model is different from a security token such as a security key. Given that Google's Find My Device network works already with different manufactures, even if someone mandate hardware security features, PUFs or whatever, we would need just a single series of a single manufacturer of haf broken device to either have counterfeit tags again or require a full exclusion from the network of all the devices of the same series, no?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that should be the consequence of having your token be forgeable. The fact that people will have to spend a bit of money to mitigate the worst outcomes of tracking is not a bad thing. \"If you are causing harm expect to be kicked out\" seems reasonable to me.</p>",
