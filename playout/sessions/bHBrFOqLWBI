I will go back and listen to the recording, but...<br>\nIt seems that your \"human-enriching applications\" (at least those in your examples) are not heavily participatory. That is, they provided very valuable enhanced services for \"community leaders\" (teachers, clinicians...) and that is not to be knocked. But what are you considering as applications that will encourage participation from the community? How are you targeting the first three of your reasons for non-connectivity (digital literacy, content/applications, language)? Maybe there is more in your paper (which I will read) and in your spoken content (which I will listen to, later)</p>",
