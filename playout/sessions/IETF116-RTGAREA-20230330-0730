It was made historic because it was based on a very early version of ISO 10589 and had a number of errors which were fixed when the first official version of ISO 10589 was published in 1992. References to RFC 1142 were always problematic because it was not up to date. We made it historic in 2014 (see RFC 7142) to eliminate folks treating it as if it were valid. (More than enough minutiae I am sure)</p>",
