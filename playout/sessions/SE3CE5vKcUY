DNS authorities aren't going to want to have to deploy HTTP stacks, and DoQ seems strictly better than DoT for many reasons if we had to pick one between them.  DoH3/DoH2 as the  primary mechanism clearly makes sense for client to DNS recursive.  For OS resolver stub to DNS recursive, I can see more arguments in various directions (primarily to keep HTTP stacks out of the OS stub resolver).</p>",
