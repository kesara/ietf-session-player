    "text": "<p>Adrian brought up one of the four questions we are targeting to get rough consensus on, which is: do we think there exist a common set of compute metrics?</p>\n<p>It seems to me that there is a need to have a holistic approach and that a common set of metrics are applicable to all stages of the service lifecycle (although a stage might have additional metrics specific for it). An analogy we are used to understand might help here. The two key service lifecycle stages (service deployment and service selection) are equivalent to the two main lifecycle stages of a communication network: (1) \"capacity planning\" and (2) \"traffic engineering\". Capacity planning deals with provisioning the right disposition of resources (say for example bandwidth and latency) to provide a communication service to a set of users. Once these resources are deployed, traffic engineering kicks in, which deals with how these resources (the same bandwidth and latency provisioned in the first stage) are utilized. These are distinct stages in the lifecycle, but they deal with the same core metrics (bw and latency). It is important that these metrics are defined taking the whole process into account, to ensure that the second stage in the lifecycle makes decisions based on metrics that are aligned with the resources deployed in the first stage.</p>\n<p>Based on this view, we agree that not all metrics are common, but some would be, and they would need to be specified taking into account the full lifecycle, rather than just one stage of it. We plan to bring this question up during today's side meeting (Karlin 4 at 15:30) and we look forward to everyone's input. Thanks.</p>",
