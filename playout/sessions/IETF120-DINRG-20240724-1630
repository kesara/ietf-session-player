This is particularly important and possible here because the issue is complex and knotty but there are agreed values and principles (decentralisation, end user choice/agency) and they are being undermined - but there are metrics, measurement, analysis to help make that visible. It's not an easy solution that comes from one place because the problem is complicated but there is power in making what is invisible, visible and building a community to advance the principles you believe in.</p>",
