You don't need NAT at all with ULA. If you need to connect networks together, you connect them together. There's no need for address rewrites or global addresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lack of a \"PD\" in <em>IPv4</em> leads to multiple layers of NAT44 for industrial networks, which means that they auditing system can not see all the devices/traffic.  ULA with routing of ULA subnets would work, but at that point, one can just use PI GUA and a simple outgoing-only firewall.</p>",
