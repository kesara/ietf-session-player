Their design depends <br/>on them in some cases. Clients are not allowed to create these list entries.<br/>Until now the system is allowed to modify the running configuration. <br/>If we would prohibit this that would be a major non-backwards-comptible change.<br/>I object to that. It would also need a YANG 2.0 revision.<br/>Even if we would prohibit the system to modify running, it would be possible <br/>to work around it. <br/>The system instantiates an onboard client to do the changes AND the system <br/>prohibits the change for other clients.<br/>However this is just a more complicated way of stating that the system itself<br/>modifies running; we gain nothing but make the world more complicated.<br/>While I agree that system-created data nodes can be problematic sometimes it <br/>is a fact of lie, so we should not remove it.<br/>Immutable:3 potential use-cases for immutable:<br/>- invariant: once a leaf is created it cannot be changed<br/>- capabilities that are created by the systems and client cannot modify them. <br/>Is this better served by immutable or system data?<br/>- Immutable NACM rules that must stay in place to protect some parts of the <br/>configuration from any modification<br/>"
