The bottom line is that, while it is possible to diddle some things, being able to use Meetecho in a mode with multiple remote presenters really constrains what it reasonably possible as long as one sticks to a single overall window.  My personal pet peeve is not being able to see the Participant list and the chat discussion at the same time and to be forced into a single-iine chat input panel.  I think that the only solution that is likely to make several of us happy at the same time would involve being able to pop the various bits out into separate windows so that they can be dragged and sized wherever one wants them (including, for those with the facilities, onto separate screens).   But that may not be a good idea for technical reasons and almost certainly isn\u0027t going to happen any time soon.",
