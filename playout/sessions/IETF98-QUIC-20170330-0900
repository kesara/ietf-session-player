BTW, the code base was already there (with some tweaking we have been able to implement a bare-bones multipath functionality into the Chromium stack). I'd be interested in knowing the reasons behind that, given the assumption that multipath is a well-recognized desired feature. I'd be interested in knowing other people's ideas on that. P.S.
