So option 1 seems nice.  I'll have to think about the authenticity question, as that is a good point Britta brought up!  I think a composite based signature would work great in this case, and supports different adversarial approaches at the same time (which I hadn't even thought about before), so I think that is a good thing.  Also, the over head of composite/hybrid based ML-DSA based signatures is very low (I had a slide on that at LAMPS) as I've had close to 5 years of experience with them.</p>",
