For management of networks, there's some help from packet flows being encrypted, so less info about what individual users do. Still, there's some traffic analysis information to be gleaned from there. But management of other types of services ... they typically would have plenty of information available, from user identities to exact details of what is being done. I agree that collecting all this info can be problematic. Wondering if the PPM type techniques might actually be helpful in some cases, allowing the identification of issues and collection of aggregate statistics, without identifying who is doing what. But a big question which service providers might be willing to do this, when they can also gather all the data in case they need it..</p>",

If you hand over data to another entity, the desire to delete/anonymise it may be reduced. So at that point you are at expecting the service provider to do the right thing. Seems safer to not send it to begin with, or send it with OHAI or PPM, than rely merely on retention policies. But of course they also should be part of the toolkit.</p>",
