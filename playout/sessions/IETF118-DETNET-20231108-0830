One of the use cases is flying racing drones (which can go 200km/h, so control lag matters!), another is real-time collaborative music performance over the net. They have done glass-to-IP-packet latencies of far less than a single frame time at the camera end; when doing uncompressed 8K video, latency is a single scan line. Bandwidths over WLAN obviously aren't high enough for that, so they use intraframe compression for flying the drones.<br>\nHe doesn't have much in English yet, but one paper in Japanese (subscription required, unfortunately):<br>\n<a href=\"https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/202205132CKb/eng/\">https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/202205132CKb/eng/</a></p>",
