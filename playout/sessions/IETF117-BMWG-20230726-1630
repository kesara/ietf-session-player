Each of sections 5 with the test cases has the same list of test cases (ingress / transit / egress).  The list of authors is almost identical.  So, good arguments from my point of view to combine them :-)</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/2/6d/HRhMy_b0NAWfB9CVeT5XH9zR/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/2/6d/HRhMy_b0NAWfB9CVeT5XH9zR/image.png\"></a></div>",

Since the tests for SR-MPLS and SRv6 need to be described separately, the merge is likely to be a sequence of separated tests. For this reason I think it can be clearer for a reader to keep them separated and therefore describe IPv6 and MPLS specific test environments separately.</p>",
