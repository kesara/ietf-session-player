    "text": "<p>Janos, thanks for pointing this out. The revision was made before the first text version of Qdv was available. Will try to add something in next revision. A quick comment to it is, current Qdv assumes point-to-point physical link between two nodes in order to maintain the cycle integrity. DetNet potentially allows more complex network structures and consequently holds some different assumptions. There can be subnetwork (TSN, MPLS TE, OTN) to provide underlying fwd and such a subnetwork can be but not necessarily must be a single point-to-point link.</p>",

These features are perfectly applicable to other devices, e.g. end stations, routers, or firewall appliances. In IEEE Std 802.1Q, the specifications of these features are scattered, and coupled tightly to the operation of a bridge. There is a need for simple reference points to these QoS specifications that are usable for non-bridge systems, and for managed objects for these features that are not specific to bridges.</p>",
