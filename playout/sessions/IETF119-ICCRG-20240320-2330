    "text": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"3004\">@altanai</span> I was just presenting in MoQ the problem of timely scheduling of media packets, according to end-to-end priorities. That scheduling depends on timely assessment of network capacity. If there is congestion, you want to stop sending the high definition video and use the bandwidth for low def. But if you are slow in detecting the congestion, you will build a queue of high def packets that will affect your performance. So, \"detect quickly\" does not mean \"sending more\" -- could be the other way around.</p>",
