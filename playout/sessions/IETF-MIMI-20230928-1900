But as far as I'm aware, there are some kinks to be ironed out for that to work. I'm not aware of anyone using MLS using that particular way of representing users. I'm not against it, but we should be sure that we know it actually works and how. Specifically, clients need to synchronize their state very well. But they might have to do synchronize user-level state anyway.</p>",
