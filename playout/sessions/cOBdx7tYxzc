    "text": "<p>Back to the addressing discussion. FWIW, I agree with others who stated the addressing discussion scope is too wide, and it would be easier to focus on something that has concrete focus. There are a million different aspects in Internet addressing architecture design, and we should avoid trying to cover entire design space. Because: 1/ some of the space relates to topics that are not actual pressing problems and 2/ for some other things the addressing or IP layer is NOT the right place to solve an issue and some other solutions eg on application layer are the right answer. In fact I'd argue the latter point is true for most things, given that in a lot of cases there is way more information available in the end-to-end application context than networks can provide, hence the application mechanisms are able to react better and with more data. Not to mention privacy, we are headed towards a direction where the networks  see very little information beyond transporting a packet to a destination. It would be difficult and probably incorrect to reverse this trend by introducing more semantics in the addresses, for instance.</p>",
