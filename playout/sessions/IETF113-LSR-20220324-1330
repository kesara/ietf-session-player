Imagine what happens if you registers @ 2 ABRs and one of them sets overload bit. Theoretically it should notify you e'thing behind it is _dead_ but guess what, you either on getting both notifications need to coallesce those (hello, massive async FSMs) or the ABRs need compute from point of view of _other_ ABRs. Now what about registration coming from left and right and you that right a guy in the middle set overload. Now do you send a down notification on the right interface only? I can come up with examples like that for a long time, what you ask graph theory wise is a&nbsp;&nbsp;very complex problem to put into a topology protocol, your best guess is to say \"if both parties can reach a common point (pub/sub) then the service is up\".
