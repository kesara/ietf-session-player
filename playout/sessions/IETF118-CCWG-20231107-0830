When we design congestion control for real-time, we also consider that TCP CCs are not going to be fair with real-time. Hence the real-time CCs are not so soft on backing and may a bit try to hold their ground and when recovering elbow a bit aggressive to gain some share in the bandwidth. So, I am not completely agree that there is not consideration needed here.</p>",
