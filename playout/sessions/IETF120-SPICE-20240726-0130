Supply chain analysis (in a vague sense with waving hands) people analyze businesses as they span the world. The company itself will claim something and it may be wrong, intentionally or unintentionally, uniformly or inconsitently, to meet a high bar with regulation or brand rep. To not do that would limit their business, so they want to hide in the ambiguity, so supply chain analysts want to analyze and determine if a company is 1) legit 2) in certain countries (like Yaron said) and 3) clearly present who legally owns what re 1 and 2 and not equivocate.</p>",
