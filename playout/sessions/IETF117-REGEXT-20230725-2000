Given that the cost and the ugliness of JCard has been eaten up already into server and client current applications, I'm towards now to just keep the JCard. Obviously, there will be new clients and servers that will occur the JCard cost. I know this is controversial and I was before all for a new clean format, and I hate my code parsing JCard but that code is less than 50 lines. So while ugly, it is still not that bad. There are many other (and more major) uglyness in Internet protocol. So I'll vote to stay with JCard.  (now shoot me...)</p>",
