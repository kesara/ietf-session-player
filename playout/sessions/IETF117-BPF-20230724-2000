This policy is available only when the registry requires RFC publication (RFC Required, IETF Review, or Standards Action; can be Specification Required). FCFS and Expert Review registrations can be made early (subject to expert approval in the latter case), but are permanent.

For Option 2, the registry/many subregistries model, the document would need to be clear about what the registration procedure(s) would be for any subregistries created in the future. (If it takes an RFC to make a registration in the main registry, the subregistry registration procedure can be left up to that RFC if you want. If a subregistry can be created for an Expert Review codepoint, we need to know the registration procedure in advance.)</p>",
