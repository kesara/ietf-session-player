Finished standards -- the only thing for which there are established (and usually high) fees if one buys them from ISO -- are also often available through national bodies at far lower cost.   Many (or most) of them are available through libraries that are available to the public, which is at variance with your \"not let anyone else read them\" assertion.  And there are provisions for others to obtain working documents for free if they are doing relevant work on standards development.  So there is obviously some confusion here (you are not the only one) and a few real problems with communication and coordination that, IMO, the IAB in recent years has aggravated.  Again, more off list.</p>",
