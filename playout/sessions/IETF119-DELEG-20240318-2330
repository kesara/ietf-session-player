If we imagine that encrypted transport metadata lives at \"TXT _foo.$NSNAME\", then resolvers have to query that and wait for an answer before following each delegation.  Yes, that's cacheable for high-volume nameservers, but the resolver has to get this record for _every_ nameserver, so long-tail nameservers seem to be subject to a performance penalty even if the TXT record is NXDOMAIN.  There are some very interesting questions about how well you can do by racing the \"A $NSNAME\" queries, but I don't think we can eliminate the overhead.</p>",
