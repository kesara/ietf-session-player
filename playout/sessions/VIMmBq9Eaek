I will address some of the main concerns in the chat here:<br/>@Gorry: In the paper, we assume that the senders are only trying to maximize their throughput. We did this to keep things simple in the paper, but this is obviously not ideal. In our complete model, we will be considering both throughput and queueing delay.<br/>@Martin: Yes, the NE observation does not hold if the gradient at the intersection point is negative. In general, we have observed that the intersection point always has a positive curve, since adding more BBR flows can never _reduce_ the total bandwidth received by the BBR flows. <br/>@Anant: The workloads in these experiments are toy workloads (long flows). We need to look into different flow sizes, workloads and utility functions.<br/>@Theresa, @Nicholas thanks for the resources!<br/>Please feel free to reach out to me at ayush@comp.nus.edu.sg!<br/>PS: @Jake: Noted! I guess it's time to fire up our measurement tool again and see what you guys are up to ;)<br/>PPS: The zoo is only going to get worse. We have also been looking into QUIC implementations of BBR, CUBIC and BBRv2 - and there is already a fair amount a speciation in these implementations.<br/>"
