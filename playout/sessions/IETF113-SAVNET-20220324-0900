The very underlying cause of this malaise is that Internet has no \"cost function\" as other network technologies had (mostly). i.e. when I charge you seriously for the stuff I have to carry for you you may think twice about giving me useless crap. So in a&nbsp;&nbsp;sense peering pricing based on usefullness of traffic helps but you'd need to charge the source/destination reliably based on the value of stuff the network decides to carry. I oversimplify drastically but thinking through Hayek's \"invisible hand\" often fixes problems that are intractable otherwise (it's going toward's Nash's PoA BTW).
