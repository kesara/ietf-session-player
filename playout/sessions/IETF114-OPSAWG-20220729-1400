Which part to address is still open there and to be discussed.  Not _all_ will be addressed, but it is not the choice between \"all\" or \"none\", we can do incremental.  The second one on energy metrics is very specific, concrete, actionable.  Maybe we can jump into YANG module definition there.  It's a common piece that will be needed in many places.  Yes, we can outline specific problems it can solve</p>",
