If such a mechanism were added to \"Proxying Listener UDP\", then I believe it could replace TURN.   WebRTC would be able use HTTP proxies that support \"Proxying Listener UDP\" where it currently uses TURN, which would be very interesting since it will likely be easier and more common to deploy HTTP servers with \"Proxying Listener UDP\" than TURN servers.

Multiple CONNECT-UDP streams will contend for that shared window and right now we don't have a common language for how to express the relative priorities of those things, such that sending over the bottleneck can be used most effectively.</p>",
