If the window is not fully received, C is 0. <br/>So I read that it cannot be the last window ack, to ensure that one bit is set later in the W. <br/>Could you elaborate?<br/>---------------<br/>\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;if the last of these SCHC Fragment messages reported missing is<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not an All-1 SCHC Fragment, then the fragment sender MAY either,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send in addition a SCHC ACK REQ with the W field corresponding to<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last window, continue the transmission of the remaining<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragments to be transmitted, or repeat the All-1 fragment to<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confirm that all fragments have been correctly received.<br/>\"<br/>Why do you copy that sentence in full?<br/>It seems unchanged, correct? <br/>But the reader has to check word by word that it is so.<br/>---------------<br/>\"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; NEW TEXT: On receiving an All-0 SCHC Fragment:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;if the receiver knows of any windows with missing tiles for the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packet being reassembled (and if network conditions are known to<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be conducive), it MAY return a SCHC Compound ACK for the missing<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragments, starting from the lowest-numbered window.<br/>\"<br/>This is not strictly speaking a replacement but really a new behavior that is intermediate between ack-always and ack-on-error.<br/>e.g., one could use it with 1 window per ack as a ack-when-feel-like-to.<br/>So I believe it should be flagged as a new behavior, before the old/new. <br/>I'd like to raise the question at the next interim, whether that this addition is clear to all.<br/>---------------<br/>"
