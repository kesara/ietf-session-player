There should be a hum feature, so that virtual participants can hum along, with a hum-button to make, and hum-meter to measure, virtual hums. Show of hands is semi-anonymous, but increasingly frequent, especially for the ubiquitous question, \"how many people have actually read the draft? ;-)\" That ought be supported too, somehow.",

If it is to be useful, then we need to provide some easy way to get WG Chairs to enter the hum questions in some Meetecho-useful form so that answers can be connected to questions.  I can\u0027t speak for Meetecho, but I\u0027m guessing that wouldn\u0027t be a big deal technically, but it does increase the number of things WG Chairs have to take responsibility for and the time it would take to provide that information might slow down meetings.

Time-stamping is a good idea, but, as someone who has had to try sorting this thing out from the chair seat, it just won\u0027t be enough, at least unless the meeting is paused after each hum to be sure the remote info comes in, etc., whether that be by Jabber or some more anonymous mechanism.
