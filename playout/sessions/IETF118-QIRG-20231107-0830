    "text": "<p>For those not on the QIRG mailing list (you should be! It's not very high traffic, and it's good.), I posted the following questions on Sunday about this draft (speaking personally):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I know it's heavily informed by your QKD work, but can you say a<br>\n   little (here on the list, no need put it in the document yet) on<br>\n   your view of the relevance of this document to more general-purpose,<br>\n   entangled quantum networks?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Likewise, what about the relationship with &lt;whisper&gt; ITU<br>\n   &lt;/whisper&gt;? You have cited (and probably worked on) a number of<br>\n   those QKD-specific documents; how do you see the IETF role v. the<br>\n   ITU role?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My _impression_ of the ITU work is that it is strongest at the<br>\n   physical layer and above the application layer, at the key<br>\n   management functionality. This leaves a big gap in the middle<br>\n   layers -- L3-4 ish, give or take.  Does that match your experience?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Quantum forwarding plane\" is probably the wrong name. For<br>\n   entangled networks, there really is no forwarding; the service<br>\n   provided by the network is creation of E2E entanglement to be<br>\n   consumed by applications.  That is very much a distributed process,<br>\n   nothing at all like the Internet's store-and-forward of packets.<br>\n   (Actually, I would expect this aspect to be true for multihop,<br>\n   trusted intermediate node QKD, as well.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Going back to point 1, how will this architecture support the<br>\n   stages of evolution of a Quantum Internet as outlined by Wehner,<br>\n   Hanson, Elkouss (Science)?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
