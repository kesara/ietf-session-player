Why do I think that \"so many hardcoded heuristics\" and \"long and complex\" is a problem?</p>\n<p>Simply - BBR seems to me to be one basic idea, amended with 15 patches (heuristics). If these all work well, I have nothing against that - but, browsing through the draft, I am almost certain that, if a variant of this document becomes an RFC, there will be no single implementation out there that's really 100% true to the RFC.  With so many knobs, everyone will twist and turn them in a different way, constantly.</p>\n<p>I think this is a problem - BUT: I also don't know what to do about that. E.g., would there be possibilities like: thinking about the BBR principles as providing a framework, and then a particular way of doing it is an instantiation  (i.e., two drafts)?  Maybe this makes no sense for BBR at all. I just want to explain how I try to think about this.   Anyway, surely, having a spec is better than not having a spec!</p>",
