And side channels tend to be discovered over time, so at the time of design I think we want to plug as many side channels as possible with the expectation that new ones will be found (and then mitigated). However within the context of that mitigation, I think we'd like the architecture itself to have privacy baked in, and that's where decoupling may be beneficial.</p>",

For e.g. in STAR, you could potentially host the Randomness Server on the OHAI proxy.
