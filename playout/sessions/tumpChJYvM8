In most cases they often share fate, so probing one of the forms is sufficient to satisfy reachability for the other.  (See example of bfd for ipv4 being sufficient in some cases for ipv6 on same link.)  However, some hardware platforms may be architected that just because transport is working and you can test to that endpoint, the underlying service directly behind that endpoint may be separably tested.</p>",
