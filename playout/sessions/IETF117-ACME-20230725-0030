For example, a malicious exit node could perhaps cause validation to succeed when it should fail, and a bad actor could try validations until they hit the exit node they want.  Even if that doesn't work, it's probably worth doing a little bit of thinking about whether HTTP-01 over Onion is actually safe.  We intentionally wrote the Appendix B validation because Onion is a bit different.</p>",
