Sorry, should have clarified. I meant that the Issuer will not be able to \"track\" the credential. So if the Verifiers work together with the Issuer (or if they are the same entity), the Issuer will not be able to link a BBS proof presentation to the user that created it (or rather the signature/signed-messages that where used to generate it).</p>",
