But, I'm probably missing something. So what am I missing? Well, if the actual problem that auditing is solving were written as the problem, then I would know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe what I'm missing is that you're being legislated into requiring an auditing solution. Fine. I can accept that. I'd rather if you put the government's reasoning for legislating auditing in as the problem.</p>",

One reason why this work is so important is that it's about <em>subjective</em> views of threat: a perfectly good piece of software for one use case may not be good enough for another. The fact of the code doesn't change, the signature is valid, but it accidentally shows up in the wrong vertical use case.So our 'threats' need to include a lot of mistakes and accidents, not just terrorists</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that's exactly a \"wrong software for application\" bug. I will definitely be looking for things like that.</p>",
