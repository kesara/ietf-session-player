It is targeted (I think) at iOS and Android, and this draft does a great, targeted, job at solving this problem.</p>\n<p>More generally, there are lots of non-WebAuthn attestation types emerging through the RATS WG. The more general wrapper format that is preferred by RATS is ConceptualMessageWrapper (CMW).</p>\n<p>We should support CMW in ACME (there seems to debate on this). A couple of design options:<br>\n1) Carl proposed that we register CMW as a sub-format of WebAuthn, then carry it inside Brandon's device-attest-01. This is messy to put a wrapper format (CMW) inside another wrapper format (WebAuthn).  </p>\n<p>The other option is to start a new draft for carrying CMW directly in ACME. Maybe we call it \"device-attest-02\", or some other challenge type. This seems more natural, not the least because WebAuthn is not an IETF spec, but CMW is (draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap), so why would we force the IETF format to be carried inside someone else's format?</p>\n<p>I would like to use AOB time to discuss this.</p>",
