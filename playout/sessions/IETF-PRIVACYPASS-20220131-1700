(i.e., don't have websites bake in something that only ends up trusting one service to attest clients)- Clients may be able to use better attester functions that are more client-chosen. Like an iOS device can do some hardware attestation that can play into things to avoid needing to solve an actual captcha, and an issuer could decide to accept that.- Some extensions, like enforcing rate limiting, need a split in order to avoid letting issuers track users.<br/>"
