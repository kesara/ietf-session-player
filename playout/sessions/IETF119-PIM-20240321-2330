    "text": "<p>as non native english speaker i asked chatGPT :-) The difference between \"lite\" and \"light\" primarily lies in their usage and connotations:</p>\n<p>Light:</p>\n<p>As an adjective, \"light\" often describes something that has a small amount of weight, is not heavy, or refers to colors that are closer to white. It can also describe something that is gentle or low in intensity, such as \"light rain.\"<br>\nAs a noun, \"light\" refers to the natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible. It can also refer to a source of illumination, like a lamp.<br>\nAs a verb, \"light\" means to make something start burning; to ignite.<br>\nLite:</p>\n<p>\"Lite\" is a term primarily used in marketing to describe a version of a product that is simpler, has fewer calories, or fewer substances (like sugar, fat, etc.) compared to the original version. For example, a \"lite\" version of an app may have fewer features than the standard version, or a \"lite\" food product may have less fat.<br>\nIt's a more informal term and is not typically used in formal writing outside of branding or advertising contexts.<br>\nThe choice between \"lite\" and \"light\" depends on the context in which you're using the word. If you're referring to weight, brightness, or the nature of light, you would use \"light.\" If you're describing a product with reduced features or content, especially in a marketing context, \"lite\" is the appropriate choice.</p>",
