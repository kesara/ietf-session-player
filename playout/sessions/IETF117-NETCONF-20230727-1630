Annotations could be added to a grouping or a typedef, or status or a type statement, etc.</li>\n</ul>",

This pushes some of the git semantics to the server, which I like.  I agree with Balazs that conflict resolution is critical, and I'd like to see an ability to squash the private on commit (or maybe you could use delete-config for that).</p>",
