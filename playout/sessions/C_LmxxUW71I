The CFRG states that very frequent rekeying improves security. I don't think that is true. The forgery probability per attemt is 2^-64 before and after rekeying. The forgery probability per packet only starts to increase at something like 2^35 forgery attampts. CCM_8 behaves very close to an ideal MAC. The important security factor for integrity is the 64 bit tag, which I think is acceptable for most IoT. An average forgery reguires 4.3 billion forgery attemps per second for 68 years.<br/>"
