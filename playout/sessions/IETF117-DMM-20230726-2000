    "text": "<p>Since the queue was closed, I comment here on the point from Jeffrey and the answer from John about the relationship of this draft with TEAS draft. The draft mentioned by Jeffreey about realization of slices with IP/MPLS solutions (draft-ietf-teas-5g-ns-ip-mpls) considers the vlan as mechanism for the mapping. This draft , as said, is for realization of the slice, so from IETF Network Slice Controller to network controller and devices underneath. Then there is another draft describing how to possibly map 5G slices from 3GPP object classes and then exercising the NBI YANG model for slice request to the IETF Network Slice Controllers. That is draft-teas-5g-network-slice-application. This latter draft includes a reference to John's draft as one of the possible ways of doing the mapping. Hope this clarifies the relation among all these drafts.</p>",
