Echo cancellation is part of browsers, though: it SHOULD work and often does, but it becomes more challenging to work effectively when one of the \"peers\" is actually a room full of people and tons of mics. That\u0027s why we always suggest remote speakers to wear a headset. When echo occurred this week, most of the times it was because the speaker wasn\u0027t wearing one.",
