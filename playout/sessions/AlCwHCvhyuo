This makes the secure session vulnerable to a precomputation attack. An attacker can spend a significant amount of time to generate a lookup/rainbow table for a particular prime number. This lookup table can then be used to obtain the shared secret for the handshake and decrypt the session.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like, what do I do when I have a customer screaming at me to \"fix\" that?<br>\nThe best I came up with was to say \"I agree with the tool that this is a \"LOW\"\", but they still want me to fix it.</p>",
