Content-encoding is tied to representations but transfer-encoding is not. Also, transfer-encoding is not a thin in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.  In other words, the server is receiving bytes of the representation (however it gets that).</p>\n<p>However, we probably would benefit from some text to discuss how HTTP/1.1 transfer-encoding might be a footgun if the server counted those bytes naiively.
