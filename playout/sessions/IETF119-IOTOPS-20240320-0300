I am not sure I have a good metaphor the different profiles represent different respective minimum requirements and baselines. In NIST parlance, I have seen profile and baseline used interchangeably. I will see how I can help you constructively with this in a review. I don't like it or agree with it, but I can acknowledge the fun state of affairs. <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span></p>",
