If you take a look at section 4.2 here (<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/423.pdf\">https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/423.pdf</a>) you can see that if the final verification step is a hash - and depending on the two algorithms used - it is quite possible: one signature masks part of the the other. </p>\n<p>But that is all discussion for a CFRG draft if there is interest, not this security goal document.
