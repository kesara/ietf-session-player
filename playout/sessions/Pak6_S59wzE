Presumably a pedantically strict legacy implementation would need to be updated to add support for the new feature anyway at which point the pedantic aspect would be fixed.<br/>"

That's also where I struggle with the idea of somehow making this backwards compatible, but to do so essentially defeats the purpose of this proposal, and as a consequence we end up with a non-backward breaking change of an RFC. Naturally RFCs are not written in stone, but that backward breaking to implementations that did follow the strict wording is a concern :) <br/>"
