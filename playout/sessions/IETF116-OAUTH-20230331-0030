    "text": "<p>FWIW, with the Internet Printing Protocol we are trying to have a printer report which auth server to use - on the client side we are requiring an allow list, i.e., the client doesn't just blindly trust the URL the printer reports. Instead, the client has a configured list of allowed and denied auth servers (which can be configured by the admin and/or user depending on the environment) and if the printer reports one that is not allowed then the user gets a Big Scary Error and you don't go any farther. I don't know whether a similar approach could be used for the more generic Resource Server providing metadata.</p>",
