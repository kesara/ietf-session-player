    "text": "<p>@Michael: I do understand your point of view, and what you are saying for static addresses is true if your environment is safe. In many environment, devices are mobile and used across environments where Privacy considerations are very important. Having a standardized solution (that you may support or not in your device) could be a very useful tool. On the infrastructure side, I think that the same way you propagate the information for 1 MAC address across the infrastructure, you can propagate 2 or more...</p>",

    "text": "<p>@MCR: Mmm... difficult answer here :D I would say that even using an individual identifier for \"environment\",  (a) it might be difficult to distinguish among \"environments\" besides a network id, and, most importantly, (b) you might want to protect tracking users across your infrastructure. Given these two factors, it might make sense to consider transferring a secret after associating (a seed, a value, etc.) that is not known to \"external\" attackers and allows the infrastructure, but not an observer, to link sessions. Believe me, I think I understand where your objections come from ... but I think that having such a protection can be quite important (and force us to be better at privacy with the next gen of wireless protocols... ?)</p>",
