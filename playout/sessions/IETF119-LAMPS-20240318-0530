You are welcome to attend our bi-weekly design team calls. This is less indirection than what some people were asking for. The problem is that there are SO MANY existing attestation formats, and most of them are not ASN.1-based and therefore don't have assigned OIDs (nor do the SDOs who maintain them care about OIDs); so you need a indirection layer to handle that the actual format might be identified by a STRING or or a codepoint or something.</p>",
